(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

I thought I might be the only person left in the world who hadn't done an eBay deal. So I decided to try my hand at online auction. Buying for beginners: Sign up on www.eBay.co.uk. Most items (e.g. tables, computers, and books) ready for auction will come with a picture and a short description; others may be marked with \\"Buy It Now\\" and have a fixed price. You can buy these right away. If the item is being auctioned, you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you.The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid, then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days, and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item. How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal, an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card. Selling made simple: If you plan to sell on eBay, it helps to include a picture of the item.I followed my friends' advice and put up the items I wanted to sell for a 10-day auction, starting on a Thursday.This way buyers had two weekends to bid.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the group that wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\"? from the following article ? Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\". The album's other singles were worldwide hits as well; \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", \\"Elevation\\", and \\"Walk On\\" reached number one in Canada, while charting in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia.","completion":"The group that wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\" is U2 as stated in the article. The process of finding the answer started from the question, which is asking for the name of a group. Understanding that, I then referred to the passage given by scanning it for any mentions of groups or bands. I found \\"U2\\" to be the group mentioned consistently throughout the passage. Later, the passage confirms that this is the correct group with the line, \\"For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of 'the band in a room playing together'\\".

Background: Epstein was born to a secular Jewish family in New York City and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts. He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. Context: On October 12, 2011, Epstein agreed to a five-year contract worth 18.5 million with the Chicago Cubs. On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Epstein's official title with the Cubs would be President and that San Diego Padres general manager Jed Hoyer would take the GM position with the Cubs. On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe, thanking Red Sox fans and the team's owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as president of baseball operations. While the Red Sox were already a winning team when Epstein was hired in Boston, the Cubs were coming off a fifth-place finish in the National League Central and had a depleted farm system. The Cubs finished in last place in the National League Central for the first three years of Epstein's presidency, as the focus was to acquire young talent rather than maximize short-term competitiveness. After a three-year, top-to-bottom rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015; their first since 2008. They advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by the New York Mets. Epstein re-signed with the club on September 28, 2016, with a five-year contract estimated to be worth up to 25million. The Cubs finished the 2016 season with a 103-58 record, the best in the MLB and their best since the 1910 season. In the playoffs, they defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS. The Cubs proceeded to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, winning their first pennant since the 1945 season and sending them to the World Series. The Cubs then won their first World Series championship since 1908, when they defeated the Cleveland Indians in 7 games, breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Billy Goat\\".

Additionally, by leading both the Red Sox and Chicago Cubs to their first World Series titles in 86 and 108 years, respectively, Epstein gained recognition for breaking two of the most famous championship droughts in sports history. While he did not set any explicit records with these achievements, his accomplishments in managing both teams to historic victories have solidified his place as one of the most successful and well-regarded executives in MLB history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. John has been hearing about climate change for last couple of years.

My trial went really well until the final day when the girl didn't do a good job of recommending the time for a brand new level 3 bed which left me completely burnt. This is my health we are talking about here and all she was concerned with was selling me a package. Day 1 - I signed up and was talked into buy lotion even though I had some. My own fault but from then on, the girl was beyond nice to me. I tried the level 1 bed for 7 mins. After my face a slightly red but nothing major. Day 3 - I tried the level 2 bed and the same girl was nice enough to recommend I try 8 mins but cover my face if it starts to feel hot. I did and i ended up with a little but of redness on my chest as well but again nothing major. Day 5 - I walked in and the place was packed. After waiting for 10 mins, I decided I would run some errands and stop back after. When I got back, all the level 3 beds were full so I did the level 4 bed. She recommended since I was red at 8 mins in the level 2 that I try 7 mins in the level 4 bed. It worked out perfectly. i covered my face and chest when they started to get hot like she recommended and came out with out any redness. Day 7 - My last day. since I had not tried the level 3 bed that is what i had left to do. This time it was a different girl. I told her i wanted to do level 3 and that 7 mins in the level 4 was fine but 8 in the level 2 was too much. So would 7 mins in the 3 be okay. She asked how i liked my lotion and if i wanted to try anything else. Then tried to sell me a package. I told her i wanted to think about it and she was quick to say okay your set in room 3. This is where everything went wrong. I left the salon feeling okay but with in hours could tell I was burned. Besides my face and chest where i had covered it part of the time I was completely burnt.

Examples include a limited liability company (LLC) and sole proprietorship. The best choice depends on your personal assets and tax liability, so ask your attorney or accountant which structure suits your needs. An LLC is the best choice for many small business owners, especially if you want to protect your personal assets. Your personal vehicle, home, and other assets won't be at risk if your business faces bankruptcy or lawsuits. To register your business with the IRS (Internal Revenue Service), you’ll need to apply for an employer identification number (EIN), which is free. Registration procedures vary by state; in general, you’ll file your business name, declare its structure, and pay registration fees. Apply online for an EIN here: https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp. Find your state’s business registration procedures here: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/state-government-websites. In the United States, you’ll need to apply for a Motor Carrier Authority Number and US DOT number with the Department of Transportation. If you only plan on traveling within state lines, you may only need an intrastate DOT number. Find your state’s DOT requirements here: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/about/webstate.cfm. For locations outside of the United States, check with your department of transportation or other appropriate agency about licensing requirements. For example, in the United Kingdom, you’ll need to apply for a good vehicle operating license with the Traffic Commissioners of Great Britain. In the United States, you’ll need to file a Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Form (2290) with the IRS. Additionally, you’ll have to pay standard business taxes, including income tax, self-employment tax, employment taxes (if you hire employees), and applicable excise taxes, such as fuel tax. Check with your nation’s revenue service if you live outside of the United States. There are strict federal and state regulations on trucking business insurance. Contact your insurance provider or look online to find an independent insurance agent. Ask them to recommend a policy that complies with federal and state standards.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is the increase in blood sugar levels, often due to consumption of food or as a response to stress. When carbohydrates are consumed and broken down, glucose (a type of sugar) is released into the bloodstream, which leads to an increase in blood sugar levels. This triggers the rest of the process, as follows: 1. Increase in blood sugar levels: After consuming food, particularly carbohydrates, or as a response to stress, blood sugar levels rise as glucose enters the bloodstream. 2. Bloodstream: The increased blood sugar circulates throughout the body, providing energy for cells and tissues. High blood sugar levels can be harmful if not managed properly. 3. The pancreas: In response to the elevated blood sugar levels, the pancreas, a gland situated behind the stomach, detects the change and releases the hormone insulin. 4. Insulin lowers sugar levels: Insulin acts as a key, allowing glucose to enter the cells where it can be used for energy. This helps lower blood sugar levels, ensuring that they remain within a healthy range. 5. Blood sugar goes back to normal: As insulin effectively transfers glucose from the bloodstream into the cells, blood sugar levels return to their normal range. This prevents potential harmful effects of high blood sugar, such as damage to blood vessels, nerves, and organs. To summarize, the missing first step in this process is the increase in blood sugar levels, which initiates the body's response to regulate and maintain blood sugar levels within a healthy range through the release of insulin from the pancreas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"International friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament proper, and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may potentially select for the tournament squad.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What do friendlies allow managers to experiment with?\\"","completion":"Yes, the given answer effectively covers the main aspects of international friendlies and how they provide managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics. However, to make the answer more comprehensive, you could expand on the benefits and even mention some potential limitations of friendlies. Here is a more detailed and longer answer to the question: International friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with various aspects of their team, including selection, tactics, and formations, before participating in competitive tournaments. These matches are crucial for managers as they offer them a chance to assess the abilities of players they may potentially choose for the tournament squad, as well as determining the most suitable playing style for the team. Some key points to consider include: 1. Team Selection: Friendlies allow managers to test different combinations of players, helping them find the best fit to achieve their tactical goals. They can also include new, untested players from domestic leagues, giving them a chance to prove their worth on the international stage. 2. Tactics: Managers can use friendlies to analyze and adapt their tactics, formations, and strategies. This enables them to implement adjustments during the matches, observe the results, and learn from any mistakes that may occur. 3. Morale and Team Chemistry: Friendlies can play an important role in improving team morale and chemistry. Allowing players to familiarize themselves with one another and work together to achieve objectives can create a sense of unity and cohesion that benefits the team in competitive matches. 4. Evaluate Opposition: Friendlies against teams from the same continent or with similar playing styles can offer valuable insights into potential opponents during the main tournament. This allows managers to make informed decisions about which players and tactics will be most effective against specific opponents. 5. Assess Fitness Levels: Managers can use friendlies to gauge the fitness levels of their players, including how well they have recovered from injuries. This helps them plan their preparations for the upcoming tournaments accordingly. However, it is worth noting that there are potential limitations to international friendlies. Depending on the schedule and travel requirements, these matches could be a source of physical strain on players who already have demanding schedules with their club teams. Additionally, the competitive nature of these encounters may be less intense than that of official tournaments, so they may not exactly replicate the tournament conditions. Overall though, international friendlies do provide managers with valuable opportunities to carry out experiments and make informed decisions to optimize their team's performance and success in the competitive arena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - oxygen - hydrogen - carbon - energy A: Answer:","completion":"After reading the given paragraph and considering the available choices, the correct answer is that starch represents a supply of energy. Starch is a carbohydrate made up of glucose subunits joined together through multiple glycosidic bonds. Glucose serves as the primary cellular fuel, as it gets broken down through a series of biochemical reactions in a process called cellular respiration. This process generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the molecule that cells use as a direct source of energy to perform a wide range of functions. Since glucose is the building block of starch, the storage of glucose in the form of starch offers cells a reserve to draw on when their immediate energy requirements demand it. Therefore, it can be inferred that starch represents a supply of energy for cells. The other options, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, do not accurately characterize the role of starch in relation to glucose being a major cellular fuel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Staff coded the receipt data and entered it into a database. Total food dollars, proportion of food dollars, and ounces of food purchased were examined for different food sources and food categories. Descriptive statistics and correlations are presented.', 'A total of 2,483 receipts were returned by 90 households. Home sources comprised 45% of receipts and eating-out sources 55%. Eating-out entrees were proportionally the largest single food category based on counts (16.6%) and dollars (106 per month). Two-week expenditures were highly correlated (r = 0.83) with four-week expenditures.Question: Do annotated receipts capture household food purchases from a broad range of sources?

Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies, and have also made use of unorthodox time signatures. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\".

The main focus of the review exhibits dissatisfaction, disappointment and an unfavorable experience overall. Several factors contribute to these negative feelings: 1. Being closed during normal business hours: The customer had expectations of the establishment being open at the mentioned time, which is typically considered a standard business hour. The unanticipated closure and lack of notice led to disappointment on behalf of the customer. 2. Inaccessibility to the staff: In addition to the physical closure, the customer experienced further frustration as they were unable to get any response over the phone or see anyone in the window.

They could have had a positive experience and appreciated the interior decor if they had been able to access the establishment properly. The inability to experience this firsthand further contributes to the negative tone of the review.

If Folkloric The Bedouin of the Sinai have a fascinating lifestyle., can we conclude that \\"Folkloric The Bedouin of the Sinai are nomadic and live in portable tents.\\"?","completion":"It is essential to understand both the concept of folkloric and the Bedouin lifestyle in the Sinai before making conclusions about their nomadic nature and living conditions. Folkloric refers to the traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed through generations by word of mouth and cultural practices. In the context of the Bedouin of the Sinai, their fascinating folkloric lifestyle is made up of their long-standing culture, values, and historical experiences. The Bedouin, usually found in regions like the Sinai Peninsula, are traditionally nomadic people, known for traveling from place to place in deserts and arid regions. Their nomadic lifestyle allows them to survive harsh climates by seeking water and grazing areas for their herds of sheep, goats, and camels. The Bedouin have expertly adapted to their environment, which is one reason why their lifestyle may be considered fascinating. Over the centuries, they have developed a unique set of skills and knowledge to thrive and maintain their way of life in an otherwise inhospitable landscape. These skills include tracking, navigation, water sourcing, and herbal medicine knowledge. Additionally, the Bedouin are known for their strong bonds within their tribes and a strict code of honor. This code includes hospitality, courage, and loyalty to family and community. Now, considering the Bedouin's folkloric lifestyle, we can conclude that they are nomadic people. Their nomadic nature is not only a result of their personal choices, but also a necessity for survival in the harsh desert climate of the Sinai. In this context, it is accurate to say that \\"Folkloric The Bedouin of the Sinai are nomadic.\\" As for their living conditions, portable tents are indeed a significant part of their traditional lifestyle. These tents, known as \\"beit al-sha'ar\\" or \\"house of black hair,\\" are primarily constructed from woven goat and camel hair. The black tents are specifically designed for the Bedouin's nomadic way of life, as they are lightweight, easy to dismantle and transport, as well as able to provide shade from the scorching sun and wind. Furthermore, the portable tents have unique structural features that adapt to the desert environment. The tents' black color absorbs heat during the cold desert mornings and reduces the sun penetration during the hottest parts of the day. The woven fabric allows for ventilation due to its slightly porous nature, maintaining a more comfortable indoor temperature. In conclusion, by considering the folkloric lifestyle of the Bedouin of the Sinai, we can correctly conclude that they are nomadic and live in portable tents. Their nomadic way of life and living conditions are not only fascinating but have been ingeniously adapted to their environment for generations, making them well-suited to survive and thrive in the harsh landscapes of the Sinai Peninsula."},{"prompt":"Information: - A political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and hold power in the government.

Let me explain the difference between being British and being English, alright? Imagine the United Kingdom as a big, colorful house with four different rooms. Each room has its own name: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Now, if someone is from the England room, we call them English. But, all the people living in this big house, no matter which room they come from, are also called British. So, being English means you're from the England room, while being British means you're from somewhere in the entire big house, which includes all four rooms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: save your money Review: I own about 10 knitting books, and this one is the first one with which I am disappointed. Many of the patterns in here are quite intuitive; meaning, that one probably doesn't need a book to be able to figure out how to knit them. Books with felting patterns should highlight patterns that are difficult to create. Otherwise, what's the point of buying a book? The challenges of felting are in determining scale and ratio, and anticipating shrinkage when you felt the item. None of these patterns are particularly interesting or nice-looking.Given its 2003 press date, I would have liked to see more fashionable items like a bucket hat, a striped felted bag with closure, and more useful household items, like a fruit bowl. Instead, the patterns include a bowler hat, felted mittens, dowdy looking slippers and several simple square bags. Its saving grace is a nice-looking felted rug, but I could have probably figured that one out as well. Isn't it just a rectangle? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, this product review appears to be negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the knitting book, stating that many of the patterns are intuitive and not challenging enough. They also criticize the lack of fashionable and useful items in the pattern selection. The only positive aspect mentioned is the inclusion of a felted rug, but the reviewer still feels that it was easily replicable without the need for the book. Overall, the review seems to suggest that the book is not worth buying and that the user should save their money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who replaces the movie's lead female villain? ? The My Scene girls are attending high school in Manhattan when they find out there's a new teen spy movie called \\"Spy Society\\" being filmed there, starring Lindsay Lohan (who plays Mariel St. Clair, the lead character) and fictional character Ryan Ridley (who plays Lohan's love interest in the movie). While the girls, Barbie, Chelsea, Madison, Nolee, and Delancey, go to watch it being filmed, they get the idea to sneak into the film by pretending to be extras. While working as extras for the movie, the girls quickly learn that there's actually a lot of work that goes into making a movie, such as getting to the set really early in the morning, doing hours and hours of takes on a scene, and Chelsea keeps getting terrible roles such as towel girl, trash girl and even being forced to clean up after the horses that are being used in the movie. The girls imagine themselves becoming best friends with Lindsay Lohan, who turns out to be really nice and down-to-earth (and who they do end up becoming friends with). When one of the actresses on the set gets hurt and is unable to play her part, Madison's called in to take her place. The actress she's replacing plays the movie's lead female villain, although the character only has five speaking lines After a while, the fame starts going to Madison's head. She also thinks that she and Ryan are dating as they always go out together and the tabloids refer to as \\"Ryan's Mystery Girl.\\" When she gets invited to a party with Ryan and Lindsay, her friends show up to surprise her.

Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. I am facing a new situation today: Two groups of soldiers started different training programs. Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.

Proposed new rules aim to improve food safety. Officials say the changes could prevent more than one million cases of food-related illnesses each year. The new rules were proposed this month, exactly two years after President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act. The rules are the first step in putting the law into effect, making the biggest changes in food safety since the 1930s. The law makes the Food and Drug Administration responsible for preventing food-related illnesses. Experts say this is a change from the role that the FDA has played in the past in reacting to disease outbreaks . Congress passed the law after a series of outbreaks linked to bagged spinach, peanut butter and other foods. Margaret Hamburg is commissioner of the FDA. \\"They occurred because of problems that would have been solved by these kinds of approaches. So I think, you know>> we're very optimistic that we will begin to see the real change. \\" The agency is proposing to require food manufacturers to show that they have identified where contamination is most likely to happen. Manufacturers would also have to show that they have taken steps to prevent it. The proposed rules also deal with safety in growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables. Caroline Smith DeWaal is director for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She says the rules should have been released a year ago.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Operation \\"Varsity\\" (24 March 1945) was a successful airborne forces operation launched by Allied troops that took place toward the end of World War II. Involving more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft, it was the largest airborne operation in history to be conducted on a single day and in one location. - George J. Peters ( 1924 -- March 24 , 1945 ) was a soldier of the United States Army and a recipient of the highest decoration of the United States Armed Forces -- the Medal of Honor -- for his actions in the final stages of World War II during Operation Varsity . - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Second Barbary War (18151816), was the second of two wars fought between the United States and the North African Barbary states of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algeria. The war between the Barbary states and the U.S. ended when \\"the U.S. Senate ratified Decaturs Algerian treaty on December 5, 1815\\". However, Dey Omar Agha, the ruler of Algeria, repudiated the US treaty, refused to accept the terms of peace that had been ratified by the Congress of Vienna, and threatened the lives of all Christian inhabitants of Algiers. William Shaler, the US commissioner who had negotiated alongside Decatur, had to flee aboard British vessels and later watched \\"shells and rockets fly over [his] house like hail\\" as a result of the subsequent Bombardment of Algiers (1816). Shaler then negotiated a new treaty after the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816, which was not ratified by the Senate until February 11, 1822, owing to an accidental oversight. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. - The Army of the United States or Armies of the United States is the legal name of the \\"land forces of the United States\\" (United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001) and has been used in this context since at least 1841, as in the title: \\"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\\". The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces). - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The date of the start of the history of the United States is a subject of debate among historians. Older textbooks start with the arrival of Christopher Columbus on October 12, 1492 and emphasize the European background, or they start around 1600 and emphasize the American frontier. In recent decades American schools and universities typically have shifted back in time to include more on the colonial period and much more on the prehistory of the Native peoples. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The First Barbary War (18011805), also known as the Tripolitanian War and the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two Barbary Wars between the United States, Sweden and the four North African states known collectively as the \\"Barbary States\\". Three of these were nominal provinces of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice autonomous: Tripoli, Algiers, and Tunis. The fourth was the independent Sultanate of Morocco. The cause of the war was pirates from the Barbary States seizing American merchant ships and holding the crews for ransom, demanding the U.S. pay tribute to the Barbary rulers. United States President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay this tribute, in addition the Swedes had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800.

Let's break down the sentence's key components to better understand the sentiment behind it. 1. \\"few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury\\": This statement expresses a positive sentiment, as it praises the film for effectively capturing the chaos and fury of intense city-based action. By using \\"few films,\\" the reviewer implies that this film stands out among others in this aspect, making its execution exceptional. 2. \\"audience members will leave feeling as shaken as Nesbitt's Cooper looks when the bullets stop flying\\": This statement contains somewhat mixed sentiments. On the one hand, it demonstrates that the film has a potent emotional impact on audience members, leaving them feeling shaken. This suggests that the film effectively immerses viewers in the experience and elicits a strong emotional reaction, which can be seen as positive. However, the negative aspect here is that this reaction may be discomfort, unease, or distress, which might be unpleasant for some viewers. Overall, it can be concluded that the sentiment of the movie review sentence is largely positive, with a minor underlying negative aspect.

Problem:The rail infrastructure owner, which has estimated its project could cost £2.8bn, is carrying out the work on the Great Western railway line. It was originally due to be finished by 2018, with most diesel trains replaced. However, some routes due to be completed before then will not be ready until 2020, resulting in new trains sitting in sidings. Under the original plan Reading to Didcot should have already been completed, with Oxford and Bristol next in 2016. But because work has fallen behind, Didcot is expected to be two years late in 2017, and Newbury and Oxford three years late in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Bristol Temple Meads will not see electric trains until 2020, and the East West rail link from Oxford to Bletchley is delayed until the early 2020s. Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, called it a \\"very large and complicated project which involves a vast number of variables across a very large area of the country\\". He added: \\"We're in a much better position to define exactly when we'll be able to complete the work.\\" Dan Panes, from Great Western Railway, said: \\"It's not good news today but what we've got to do is make sure that we deliver those improvements.\\" Christopher Irwin, from passenger Group TravelWatch Southwest, said the news was \\"dreadful\\". He added: \\"We've got to have trains - electric, diesel, or whatever. We need more trains and more seats.\\" Network Rail's chief executive Mark Carne told MPs in October the estimate for the project had been £874m in January 2013 and £1.5bn in September 2014. He said because of \\"inadequate planning\\" it could now reach £2.8bn. Solution:","completion":"The £2.8bn Great Western railway electrification project has experienced delays, pushing expected completion for some routes from 2018 to 2020, with causes cited as inadequate planning and the project's vast scope."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: How do I scrub a stain out of my carpet?","completion":"Absolutely, let me explain it in a simple way: You know how sometimes you accidentally spill some juice or color on your favorite drawing paper and it creates a stain? The same thing can happen with our carpets. 1. First, tell an adult about the spill straight away. Speedy action can help remove the stain better and faster. 2. Like your toys, different carpets need different care. It's better for grown-ups to check what kind of care a carpet needs before using any cleaning stuff on it. 3. Materials needed to help clean the stains are a white cloth or a sponge, warm water, a little dish soap or vinegar, and a small bowl. 4. The grown-up can put some warm water in a bowl. Then, add few drops of dish soap or vinegar into it. Stir it a little till it mixes well. 5. Dip the white cloth or sponge into the soapy water or vinegar water - remember, just a little, it doesn't need to be soaking wet. 6. Then, they can gently rub on the stain with the cloth or sponge, the same way you gently color inside the lines, not too hard. 7. Once the stain starts disappearing, the adult will use another part of a clean, dry cloth to blot or tap on the wet area to dry it. 8. It is important to remember to always be gentle when cleaning a carpet, like you are with your teddy bear, so we don't harm it.

Q: Head: PersonX accepts the offer<sep>Tail: excited A:","completion":"The task is asking you to analyze two separate but related phrases or events. The first event, referred to as the 'Head', will involve a character named PersonX doing something or reacting in some way. The second event, referred to as the 'Tail', will suggest a potential intention or emotional state of PersonX. Your job is to decide whether the 'Tail' event can be seen as the intended outcome or emotional state of the PersonX based on the 'Head' event. To clarify this with an example, if we have the phrase: Head: PersonX gives PersonY a gift<sep>Tail: PersonX wants to make PersonY happy. In this scenario, your task is to decide if giving a gift (the 'Head') is genuinely intended to make PersonY happy (the 'Tail'). There are some additional rules to bear in mind. Sometimes, there might be a placeholder '___' in the events. This could represent an object, a person, or even an action that isn't directly specified, and you'll have to infer based on the information provided. Also, you'll need to give responses as either 'Yes' or 'No'. Now let's look at the given example: Head: PersonX accepts the offer<sep>Tail: excited. In this specific case, the question is asking if PersonX is excited because they accepted the offer. You need to consider whether accepting the offer would logically result in PersonX becoming excited. If you believe this fits, you would answer \\"Yes\\". If not, your answer would be \\"No\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Former world number one Rafael Nadal will end a six-month absence from tennis when he competes in an Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament later this month, the Spaniard has revealed. Nadal has been sidelined by knee problems following June's shock second-round exit at Wimbledon to 100th-ranked Czech Lukas Rosol. \\"Can't wait to get back on court in Abu Dhabi at the end of the month,\\" he wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages. \\"I won the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in 2010 and 2011 -- would love to get my hands on the trophy again this year.\\" After his Wimbledon exit, the 11-time grand slam champion was diagnosed with Hoffa's syndrome, an inflammation of the fatty tissue in his left knee that has sidelined him on numerous occasions over the years. The injury meant Nadal was unable to defend his Olympic title at London 2012, with the 26-year-old dropping to fourth in the rankings after also missing out on the U.S. Open and Spain's Davis Cup final defeat to the Czech Republic in November. Having started training again late last month, Nadal will make his return in Abu Dhabi on December 28, 17 days before the first grand slam of 2013 -- the Australian Open in Melbourne. Earlier this month, he said it would be difficult to win the Australian Open after such a lengthy period off court, warning fans not to expect \\"miracles.\\" Nadal has a first-round bye in Abu Dhabi, then plays the winner of the match between U.S. Open and Olympic champion Andy Murray and ninth-ranked Serbian Janko Tipsarevic. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will also line up in the six-man, three-day event. He will play either world No. 5 David Ferrer or Czech Davis Cup winner Tomas Berdych on the second day. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation has named Djokovic and third-ranked woman Serena Williams as its 2012 world champions. Djokovic received the honor for the second year running, as the Serbian retained the Australian Open and won the season-ending ATP championship but suffered the disappointment of losing the final at both Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows. \\"I am proud to have been named ITF World Champion for the second successive year,\\" said the 25-year-old. \\"It was very difficult to follow up such a successful season in 2011, but it was extremely satisfying to win another grand slam title, reach two other major finals and finish the year at No. 1.\\" Meanwhile, Williams was in vintage form in 2012 as the 31-year-old tasted Olympic singles gold for the first time in addition to taking her grand slam collection to 15 titles, following this year's triumphs at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. \\"It means a lot to be named ITF World Champion for the third time,\\" said Williams, who finished the season with a WTA Tour-best seven titles. \\"It has been such an amazing experience this year to win the Olympics and two grand slam tournaments, and I look forward to having an awesome 2013.\\" It is the second year in a row that the top-ranked woman has missed out on the ITF award -- last year Petra Kvitova headed off Caroline Wozniacki. This time Victoria Azarenka missed out despite leading the earnings list with more than 7 million in prize money and winning her first grand slam in Melbourne.

However, there is no mention of a man reading a newspaper on a bench. We cannot conclude that \\"A man reads a newspaper on a bench\\" based on the initial statement, as there is no apparent connection or evidence supporting this second scenario's occurrence. The two situations are distinct, and, without any provided context linking them, they must be treated as separate occurrences - they could be happening simultaneously or at completely unrelated times, for example.

The presence of the woman in yellow and the yellow car may indeed be taking place in the same vicinity as the man reading the newspaper, but there is no reason to deduce that one situation necessarily implies the existence of the other. In conclusion, while the two situations could potentially coexist, the initial statement does not offer enough information to substantiate the existence of \\"A man reads a newspaper on a bench.\\" These distinct events, it seems, do not have sufficient connection to allow one to confidently or logically confirm the presence of one based on the occurrence of the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox. They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, Persuasion, at a train station where Kate said she had lost it, and Alex taking Kate on a walking tour of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox.

Article: Having a child may improve a woman's memory, a new study suggests. In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said. Question: It can be inferred that Santiago believe the findings of the study _ . Options: A: may cause a heated discussion among parents B: may cause an increase in the birth rate C: are tested by previous similar studies D: are encouraging news for mothers Answer:","completion":"D: are encouraging news for mothers"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the premise, it is mentioned that \\"everybody over here likes crawfish,\\" which directly contradicts the hypothesis that there are very few people who like crawfish in that location. The premise indicates that crawfish is a popular and well-liked food among the people in that particular area. It also suggests that the speaker believes they won't have to worry about satisfying their personal preferences or needs when it comes to crawfish, as it is a commonly enjoyed dish within the community. In this context, the speaker might not necessarily imply that every single person in the area likes crawfish, but the statement denotes a general understanding that the majority of individuals do. This collective fondness for crawfish might stem from the local culture or the prevalence of crawfish-based dishes in the area. In summary, considering the information provided in the given premise, the hypothesis that there are very few people in the area who like crawfish stands invalid. Instead, the premise suggests that crawfish is a popular and enjoyed dish among most people in that location."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The match took place at Craven Cottage, which is a stadium in London and the home ground of the Fulham Football Club. Mark Schwarzer is an Australian professional footballer who used to play as a goalkeeper. In this specific match, he made a significant error that cost his team, Australia, the victory they were looking forward to. The text does not provide exact details about the nature of the error, but it indicates that the mistake was crucial and led to the 2-2 draw with Norway instead of an Australian win. This draw meant that both teams scored two goals each during the match, and neither team could be declared the winner. The inclusion of the term \\"Unlucky Aussies\\" implies that the outcome of the game was unfortunate for the Australian team and its supporters. This bad luck was primarily attributed to the mistake made by Mark Schwarzer during the match. Schwarzer's role as a goalkeeper is particularly essential, as goalkeepers are responsible for preventing their opponents from scoring by guarding the goal line. In conclusion, the text is about a football match between Australia and Norway featuring an unlucky incident involving the Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. His crucial error at the game, held at Craven Cottage, resulted in a disappointing 2-2 draw, robbing Australia of a possible victory.

Sad stories do exist in large numbers for the past lottery winners and that's why some financial experts say \\"70 percent of lottery winners will squander away winning within a few years.\\" Some end up losing all within two years, family relationships destroyed or even worse. Wayne Schenk was an old soldier diagnosed with lung cancer. When he won a million dollars in a lottery he thought his troubles were over and he would get the advanced medical treatment that might save his life. But Lottery officials refused to pay him the total sum in a single payment and they said they could not make an exception to the regulations. When Schenk died in 2007, he'd only received one payment of 34,000.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming.

Generally, a company's name doesn't get translated as it's a registered name and therefore used as it is regardless of language. If we would break down the phrase, here is what it would mean in English: 1. \\"Les\\" - This is a French definite article that means \\"The\\" in English. 2. \\"Amusements\\" - This is the same in English and retains its meaning of \\"amusements,\\" indicating some form of entertainment. 3. \\"Wiltron\\" - This appears to be a proper noun, possibly a family or corporate name.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (19482015), set on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with current cultural, political and scientific issues. The series is popular, with more than 80 million books sold in 37 languages. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. - Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. - In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta (\\"Hippolyte\\") was the Amazonian queen who possessed a magical girdle she was given by her father Ares, the god of war. The girdle was a waist belt that signified her authority as queen of the Amazons. She figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. As such, the myths about her are varied enough that they may be about several different women. - The Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: \\"This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.\\" - Sir Terence David John \\"Terry\\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, \\"The Colour of Magic\\", was published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel \\"Snuff\\" was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, \\"The Shepherd's Crown\\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death. - The Colour of Magic is a 1983 comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the \\"Discworld\\" series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as \\"an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what \\"Blazing Saddles\\" did for Westerns.\\" - Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld book by Terry Pratchett . It was originally published in 1992 . Much of the storyline spoofs elements of Shakespeare 's play A Midsummer Night 's Dream . - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", both canonical to the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'main subject'.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it is not explicitly clear whether the user would recommend the product or not, as they do not specifically state their overall opinion about it. However, we can analyze the provided information and make an educated guess. The user mentions that \\"it's just another game of bingo\\" and \\"nothing too exciting.\\" From this, we can infer that the user likely does not find the product to be exceptional, unique, or particularly engaging. This suggests that the user may not be extremely enthusiastic about recommending the product to others. On the other hand, the user also mentions that their 4-year-old is \\"getting the point of how to play.\\" This implies that the user sees at least some educational or developmental value in the product, as it is helping their child understand and engage with the game. Consequently, the user might recommend the product to others whose children are around the same age, or who are interested in similar educational games. Taking these factors into account, our best guess is that the user's recommendation would be somewhat neutral or ambivalent. They might not actively recommend the product due to its lack of excitement or innovation, but they also might not discourage others from trying it out, particularly if they believe it might have potential educational benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking if the statement \\"it gets cooked quicker\\" is the right answer to the question of what happens when food is stored below 40 degrees. Step 2: Evaluate the given information We are given that food stays fresh under 40 degrees. Step 3: Identify the concepts related to the question The concepts related to the question include food storage and cooking processes. Step 4: Relate temperature to freshness and cooking Freshness is related to food storage and maintaining low temperatures to prevent bacterial growth or spoilage. Cooking, on the other hand, involves applying heat to food to make it palatable and safe to eat. Step 5: Infer the relation between storage temperature and cooking time Since freshness is being maintained under 40 degrees, it is unlikely that the food will be inclined to cook at that temperature. Cooking typically requires higher temperatures to denature proteins, kill bacteria, and change the food's texture and taste. Step 6: Formulate the answer Answer: No, the right answer to the question, \\"what happens when food is stored below 40 degrees?\\" is not \\"it gets cooked quicker.\\" Instead, storing food below 40 degrees helps keep it fresh by slowing down bacterial growth and preserving its quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A third person died Friday from an explosion at a rocket test pad operated by a private company in California's southern Mojave Desert, according to the nursing supervisor at Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield. A bird's eye view of the scene in Mojave, California, shows charred wreckage and large pieces of debris. The explosion, which occurred Thursday at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, initially killed two people and critically injured four others. On Friday three people remained hospitalized -- two in critical condition, one in serious condition. The six were employed by Scaled Composites, an aerospace development company founded 25 years ago by Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who designed the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. According to Rutan, the blast occurred during a test involving nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors.

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Nitrogen bases on the two chains form hydrogen bonds with each other. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and guanine always bonds with cytosine. These bonds hold the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape. You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in Figure below . Sugars and phosphate groups form the \\"backbone\\" of each chain of DNA. The bonded bases are called base pairs. RNA, in contrast to DNA, consists of just one chain of nucleotides.

Given the following passage \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\", answer the following question.

A 11-year-old orphan, Anne Shirley, is living in servitude with the cruel Hammond family in Nova Scotia. However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. I am facing a new situation today: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is less likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation with Jake and Ryan, it is clear that Ryan is less likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles compared to Jake. This conclusion can be reached by analyzing the factors that contribute to lowered oxygen supply and how they relate to the presence of arterial plaques, as described in the article. Atherosclerosis, as mentioned in the article, is a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. Over time, these deposits lead to the formation of plaques, which in turn can restrict or even block the flow of blood through the blood vessels. A decrease in blood flow can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In severe cases, a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart can result in a heart attack, causing significant damage due to oxygen deprivation and possibly even leading to death. In the new situation with Jake and Ryan, the doctor found that Jake had a high amount of plaques on the interior of his arterial wall, while Ryan had none. Therefore, considering the presence of plaques as a significant factor in blood flow restriction and subsequently, lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle, Ryan is less likely to face this issue compared to his father. It is important to note that the presence of plaques is not the sole determinant of a person's risk of heart disease or lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscles. Factors such as age, genetics, diet, physical activity levels, and overall health also play a role in determining an individual's risk of developing heart disease or experiencing oxygen deprivation in the heart muscles. However, in this specific scenario, the absence of plaques in Ryan's arterial walls indicates a lower likelihood of restricted blood flow and, consequently, a lower risk of lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles compared to Jake."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The mild-mannered Harold Diddlebock is promptly hired by the pompous advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry (Raymond Walburn) to work at his firm. Harold is given a low-paying job at the firm's bookeeper.Jumping forward 22 years to 1945, Harold (still working in his boring job as bookkeeper) is promptly let go by Waggleberry with nothing but a tiny pension of around 1,000. Harold bids farewell to the girl at the desk down the aisle, Miss Otis (Frances Ramsden), whom he had hoped to marry just as he had hoped to marry five of her older sisters before whom also worked at the firm.As Harold wanders aimlessly through the streets, his life's savings in hand, he has a run-in with an older man; a slimy racetrack tout named Wormy (Jimmy Conlin) and finds himself in a bar. When he tells the bartender (Edgar Kennedy) that he's never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \\"The Diddlebock\\", one sip of which is enough to release Harold from all his inhibitions, setting him off on a day-and-a-half binge of spending and carousing.

Will also questions if conservatism has advanced far enough to resolve the ongoing economic crisis by settling for a candidate like Romney. This criticism comes from an influential and respected voice among conservatives, which might signal dissatisfaction with Romney from the Republican establishment. While many on the right believe the party can find a better candidate, it is important to note that Will is one of the most prominent conservative voices to express this opinion explicitly. Jonathan Chait at Daily Intel further discusses the lukewarm response Romney has received from conservatives, implying potential challenges for his campaign and the Republican Party’s broader goals in the upcoming election. As George Will's influential voice highlights conservatives' discontent with Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy, it raises doubts about whether Romney is the best candidate to address the country's economic crisis and if his nomination could damage GOP chances of capturing the Senate. The comparison to Michael Dukakis emphasizes Will's view of Romney as a politician who revises his principles and leans towards technocratic solutions rather than embodying the true spirit of conservatism. This critique, coming from an established figure in conservative circles, might suggest a significant challenge for Romney's campaign and the overall direction of the Republican Party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Caterham have confirmed that Will Stevens will complete their driver line-up for this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The 23-year-old Briton teams up with Kamui Kobayashi for the season-ending double pointer for which cash-strapped Caterham announced they would race a week ago after going into administration last month. Earlier this month, Caterham launched a crowd-funding project in a bid to raise the £2.35million needed to get the team on the grid for the final race of the season. Administrators Smith & Williamson announced last Friday that they were just under £500,000 short and that they would race at the Yas Marina. British racer Will Stevens will make his debut for Caterham at the season finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Stevens, 23, was part of the Caterham Academy and has tested for the F1 team, pictured here in 2013. Stevens was part of the Caterham Racing Academy and has been involved in Formula One testing for the Leafield-based marque in 2013 and this year, clocking up 1,100kilometres in the process and gaining his FIA Super licence. He is delighted to be given the chance at Caterham for the final race on the 2014 calendar and said: 'I'm absolutely thrilled to be getting this opportunity and am very grateful to everyone involved at Caterham F1 Team for giving it to me. 'I feel ready for the challenge of my F1 debut and look forward to working as part of the Team in a race environment after all the work we've done together previously in the tests I've completed and back at Leafield in the sim (simulator). 'Hopefully this will be something we will be able to carry through to the 2015 season together.' Caterham head of engineering operations Gianluca Pisanello was pleased to have Stevens on board in Abu Dhabi as the team return to the track after missing out in the last two races in the United States and Brazil. He said: 'We know Will very well through his involvement in the Caterham Racing Academy. 'More importantly he has done a vast amount of time in our simulator, completing around 10,000km, which has built his experience both of this year's car and with the engineering team that are going to Abu Dhabi. 'In addition, his 2014 test at Silverstone in our current car, where he completed over 500km, was very successful and his race pace was very good. 'As a result, he was one of our best candidates for this race weekend and we are delighted to have secured his services for our return to the F1 grid.'

The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it.

The reviewer extensively shares their enjoyment of the movie, including elements such as car chases, gun shooting scenes, fight scenes, and the presence of a female character, usually termed as a 'token girl' in the film industry. While they mention that the movie does not excel in some of these aspects, they express their clear preference for the car-related scenes, particularly the chase sequence toward the end of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer defends the film's credibility and practicality, stating that what may seem like an unrealistic jump in the car chase is in fact, possible, as confirmed by IMDB. This points to the reviewer's appreciation for the film's realism, and the extent to which they trust and value the filmmakers' creative choices. Contrary to some critical opinions, the reviewer argues that the movie does have quality and that they genuinely enjoyed watching it so much that they 'loved' it. They even appreciated the film's ability to engage them without requiring them to constantly question the possibility or feasibility of what was occurring on screen. Finally, the reviewer gives a high rating to the movie, a solid 9 out of 10, further emphasizing their positive stance towards the film. Some might interpret the comment \\"I didn't need to turn off my brains to watch it\\" as negative, indicating the movie's simplicity or lack of depth; however, given the context and the reviewer’s overall positive tone, it seems the reviewer rather appreciates the movie's straightforward nature and the fact it did not force them into overly critical or skeptical thinking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory.

Read this and answer the question The similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves \\"Czechoslavs\\" (Čechoslováci), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and (to a lesser extent) Hungarians and other Slavs. During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), although \\"Czechoslovak\\" was designated as the republic's official language both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II) literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech.

Input: Ottawa said it would spend C2 billion to help buy supplies amid complaints from some doctors and nurses about shortages of personal protection gear. “The situation is going to get worse before it gets better. That is the unfortunate truth,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told a daily briefing. By 9 a.m. eastern time (1300 GMT,) those diagnosed with the coronavirus had risen by 15% to 7,708. The respective figures at 1200 ET on Monday were 66 deaths and 6,671 positive diagnoses. Chief public health officer Theresa Tam said she was particularly concerned the virus was spreading to enclosed settings where vulnerable people live, such as seniors’ residences, prisons and aboriginal communities. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would invest 2 billion to support testing and to purchase ventilators and protective personal equipment such as masks, face shields, gowns and hand sanitizer. In Quebec, the second-most-populous of the 10 provinces, Premier Francois Legault said “my biggest concern right now is for the medical supplies. Currently, for some equipment, we have only (enough) for three to seven days”. New shipments should arrive “in the next few days,” he told a daily briefing. Ottawa has signed agreements with three Canadian companies to produce the needed supplies, with five other deals pending, said Trudeau. “We know that the demand for critical equipment and supplies will grow in the coming weeks, so we need a sustainable, stable supply,” he told reporters. “That means making them at home and we’re optimistic that they will be available in the coming weeks.” Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Ottawa had already bought more than 157 million surgical masks. Boosting supplies of medical equipment is part of Ottawa’s response to an outbreak that has forced the closure of many businesses and schools. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said schools in what is the most populous province would be closed until at least May 1. “I’m prepared to extend these closures even further,” he added. Manitoba said it would close schools for the rest of school year. Ottawa has pledged financial help for people and employers hit by the crisis.

Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to homicide. When he is informed by Crazy Willie (Elisha Cook, Jr.) of an apparent suicide via shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder. Detective Harve Poole (Mitchell Ryan) agrees it is a homicide, after a .22 bullet is found in the man's skull during the autopsy, as well hearing about a possible missing 5,000 from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case. Wintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the hippies whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend Jolene (Jeannine Riley). The hostile workplace politics cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement. Despite being demoted, Wintergreen is able to solve the murder. The killer turns out to be Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen surmises Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the 5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed Electra Glide motorcycle. Wintergreen is forced to shoot Zipper after he becomes distressed and belligerent, and shoots an innocent bystander while brandishing a gun. As the film ends, Wintergreen is alone and back on his old beat, when he runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing near the beginning of the film. Wintergreen lets him off with a warning but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him.

Premise: \\"'Don't call me that.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It is fine if you call me that.\\" true? Possible answers: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","completion":"3). No Based on the given premise, \\"'Don't call me that.\\", it is clear that the person is expressing their disapproval or discomfort with the use of a certain name, term, or label. They might not like it because it could be offensive, disrespectful, hurtful, or simply not an accurate representation of their identity or personality. Given this understanding, the hypothesis \\"It is fine if you call me that.\\" would not be true. The original premise indicates that the person specifically does not want to be called by that name, term, or label, and therefore, it would not be \\"fine\\" to continue using it. From a logical standpoint, the premise and hypothesis are contradictory. The premise asserts a negative statement, requesting not to be called by a specific term. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a positive statement that implies it is acceptable to continue using that term. Consequently, the two statements cannot coexist as true at the same time. To further illustrate this point, consider the following example: In a social setting, a person named James hears someone addressing him by a nickname he dislikes (e.g., \\"Jimmy\\"). He says, \\"Don't call me that.\\" Therefore, the premise is established: James does not want to be called \\"Jimmy.\\" Now, if we examine the hypothesis, \\"It is fine if you call me that (Jimmy)\\" in the context of the given premise, it becomes evident that this second statement is contrary to James's original sentiment. He already expressed his desire not to be called \\"Jimmy,\\" which indicates it is not fine to call him that. Consequently, the hypothesis cannot be true based on the information provided in the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"It is fine if you call me that.\\" is not true, given the original premise \\"'Don't call me that.\\" The person's clear request not to be called by a specific name, term, or label directly contradicts the notion that it is acceptable to continue using that term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How did the STOVL aircraft take off from the deck?\\" Context: \\"Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\" Answer:","completion":"The Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft, such as the iconic Harrier jet, take off from the deck using a combination of engineering ingenuity and carefully orchestrated physics. The concept of STOVL aircraft was developed to allow for the efficient launching of heavily loaded and fueled aircraft from smaller carriers, where standard takeoff and landing procedures are not feasible. One innovative solution that has since been widely adopted is the introduction of a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. The ski-jump ramp was first developed by the Royal Navy and has since been incorporated into many smaller carriers around the world. The ramp works by converting some of the aircraft's forward rolling movement into vertical velocity, effectively providing the aircraft with an initial upward thrust as it leaves the ramp. This upward trajectory helps the aircraft attain sufficient airspeed and lift to stabilize and sustain normal flight in a shorter amount of time and distance compared to traditional flat deck takeoffs. In addition to the ski-jump ramp, another technique employed by STOVL aircraft is the directing of jet thrust partly downwards. This is achieved by rotating the jet engine exhaust nozzles to an angle where the jet blast is aimed downward, providing additional lift from the thrust vectoring. The combined effect of the ski-jump ramp and thrust vectoring allows heavily loaded and fueled STOVL aircraft to take off successfully, even if the available runway length on the carrier is limited. To further understand the process, let's break down the steps involved in a STOVL aircraft takeoff from the deck: 1. The STOVL aircraft positions itself at the beginning of the ski-jump ramp, facing forward. 2. With the jet engine nozzles directed partly downwards, the aircraft throttles up, increasing engine power to prepare for takeoff. 3. The aircraft begins its rolling takeoff and accelerates along the flight deck, transitioning from a flat surface to the upward-sloping ski-jump ramp. 4. As the STOVL aircraft approaches the end of the ramp, the conversion of forward rolling movement into vertical velocity occurs, giving the aircraft additional upward inertia. 5. The combined effect of the ski-jump ramp and the jet thrust directed partly downwards provides the necessary acceleration, lift, and additional vertical velocity for the aircraft to leave the carrier deck and gain altitude. 6. Once the STOVL aircraft has reached a sufficient airspeed and altitude, it transitions into normal horizontal flight. The pilot adjusts the jet engine nozzles back to a horizontal position, and the aircraft continues on its mission. In conclusion, the STOVL aircraft takeoff from the deck is made possible through the clever use of a ski-jump ramp, which provides extra lift and upward momentum to help these aircraft attain flight quickly and efficiently. The combination of the ramp design and the redirection of jet thrust helps to launch heavily loaded and fueled aircraft in a shorter distance and with a higher likelihood of success, providing an invaluable advantage for military operations on smaller carriers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following the overtime win against the Ravens, the Redskins traveled to Cleveland Browns Stadium to take on the Cleveland Browns in hopes to gain their first five-game win streak since 2005. The game started slowly for the Redskins, behind rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins, filling in for fellow rookie Robert Griffin III, who sprained his LCL the week prior. After a series of punts, Cousins threw a pass over the middle that was intercepted by T. J. Ward and returned to the Washington 5. Cleveland then used their first-round rookie, Trent Richardson to punch it in and take a 7-0 lead. However, Cousins was able to settle in after this, as he fired a pass to Leonard Hankerson for a 54-yard score to even the game at 7 apiece. In the second, both teams continued to exchange possessions, and eventually scores, in a tit-for-tat manner, as Kai Forbath connected from 44 yards out to give Washington a 10-7 lead. Cleveland, however would respond with another Richardson touchdown, to take a 14-10 lead at halftime. In the third, Cleveland got the ball first, but Brandon Weeden threw an interception to Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson, and Washington quickly converted, as running back Alfred Morris scored from 3 yards out to put Washington back on top 17-14. Following a Cleveland punt, Washington drove down the field again, and Cousins again found Hankerson, this time from two yards away, and Washington took a 24-14 lead. In the fourth, Washington capitalized on a second Weeden interception, this time by London Fletcher, and capped off the drive with an Evan Royster 4-yard touchdown run to take a 31-14 lead. However, Cleveland would not surrender, as Weeden found wide receiver Travis Benjamin for a 69-yard strike, and got back into the game at 31-21. Not to be outdone, Cousins led a clock-chewing, 5 minute drive that culminated with Morris' 2nd Touchdown run of the day, this time from 8 yards out, to effectively put the game away, taking a 38-21 lead. Cleveland tried to answer, but went four and out, and Washington was able to run out the clock. With the win, the Redskins advance to 8-6 which guarantees them to end the season at .500 for the first time since 2008. Additionally, the win was their fifth consecutive win, their longest streak since Weeks 13-17 of the 2005 season. Most importantly, however, the New York Giants' 34-0 loss to the Atlanta Falcons put Washington in first place in the NFC East, meaning, if they win their final two games, they will be division champions for the first time since 1999.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: The narrator saw the billboard for business management solutions: Options: A.

It is believed that the Baltic languages are among the most archaic of the currently remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late attestation. Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by ancient historians as early as 98 B.C., the first attestation of a Baltic language was about 1350, with the creation of the Elbing Prussian Vocabulary, a German to Prussian translation dictionary. Lithuanian was first attested in a hymnal translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas was published in 1547 in Königsberg, Prussia . Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585. One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples resisted Christianization longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence. With the establishment of a German state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct. During the years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , official documents were written in Polish, Ruthenian and Latin. After the Partitions of Commonwealth, most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the Russian Empire, where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a Russification effort .

For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too. Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything. One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag. So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her. During the dinner, my father asked me, \\"Why do you look unhappy?\\" \\"Today I saw something fall out of Anna's bag, so called her. But she didn't answer me. She is _ . \\" said angrily. \\"Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. \\" What my father said suddenly woke me up. Because she is deaf, she does not talk or play with anyone at school. She seems to have everything, but in fact she doesn't. Not everyone is perfect, even the perfect man has his weakness. Question: Why doesn't the writer like Anna? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because Anna seems to be the best in everything.\\"? Answer:","completion":"The writer initially does not like Anna because Anna seems to be the best in everything, as evidenced by her beautiful possessions and appearance. This perfection makes the writer uncomfortable and hesitant to befriend Anna. However, it is essential to consider that the writer's opinion changes upon discovering that Anna is deaf, which influences her inability to communicate and socialize with others at school. As a result, the initially perceived perfection is challenged, understanding that nobody is perfect, and everyone has their weaknesses. In conclusion, although the initial answer to the question could be \\"Yes\\", it is crucial to acknowledge that the writer's perspective changes after learning about Anna's deafness, which provides a deeper understanding of her character and challenges the idea of her being perfect in everything."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: GAO has reported that well-chosen federal spending for infrastructure, education, and R&amp;D that is directly intended to enhance the private sector's long-term productivity can be viewed as federal investment. Here is a hypothesis: Well-chosen federal spending for infrastructure, education, and R&D can enhance productivity because they are compatible. Here are the options: pick from the following. (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"(A). Yes The premise and the hypothesis presented share a very close relationship and support each other. They both converge towards the same notion – federal spending, if well-directed towards infrastructure, education, and Research & Development (R&D), can enhance the productivity of the private sector in the long-term. Let's decompose both the premise and the hypothesis to understand this correlation better. The premise from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) underscores that appropriate and strategic federal spending on certain realms — namely infrastructure, education, and R&D — intended explicitly to enhance long-term productivity in the private sector, can be considered a federal investment. This statement already establishes a direct relationship between such targeted spending and productivity enhancement. The term 'investment' in this context can be inferred to signify a venture that brings in returns over time, adding value to the economy. In the case of the GAO's statement, the return on investment is the increased long-term productivity of the private sector. Therefore, it argues that investing in these specific areas is not an expense but a strategic move expected to generate greater output. The hypothesis, on the other hand, postulates that well-chosen federal spending on infrastructure, education, and R&D can enhance productivity because they are compatible. The term 'compatible' here can imply that there exists a synergistic relationship among these sectors that can contribute to increased productivity. Infrastructure, education, and R&D form the troika that directly contributes to the betterment of the economy, societal advancement, and technological development. Quality infrastructure provides the physical systems and structures needed for developing a thriving business environment. Investing in education generates a skilled workforce capable of fostering innovation, production, and efficiency. And funding R&D leads to new technologies and innovations, improving productivity and competitive advantage. Thus, observing both the statements, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Given their inherent compatibility, their cumulative effect would naturally enhance the private sector's productivity in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: The comparison of biodiversity between era A, when dinosaurs were flourishing prior to 66 million years ago, and era B, the time period marked by the mass extinction event around 66 million years ago, requires a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects influencing biodiversity during these two distinct periods. During era A, dinosaurs were the dominant group of terrestrial animals and inhabited a diverse range of ecosystems across the planet, including forests, coastal plains, and deserts. The presence of numerous habitats allowed for the evolution of a wide variety of dinosaur species, with some estimates suggesting that over 1,000 different species existed during this period. Additionally, era A witnessed the development of other groups of organisms, such as marine reptiles, mammals, insects, early birds, and plant life. All of these factors contributed to a rich and varied collection of species at both the global and ecosystem level, resulting in a high level of biodiversity. On the other hand, era B, identified by the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, was marked by significant disruptions to Earth's ecosystems, with estimated extinction rates of approximately 75% of all species on the planet. This event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, was likely a consequence of a combination of factors, including the massive impact of an asteroid and extreme volcanic activity. The widespread destruction caused by these events led to the collapse of numerous ecosystems and a drastic reduction in biodiversity, both on land and in the ocean. Following the mass extinction in era B, biodiversity began to rebound in the subsequent time periods, with the emergence of new groups of animals and plants. The extinction of non-avian dinosaurs created a variety of open niches, enabling the radiation and evolution of numerous new lineages, including the early ancestors of mammals. This process of diversification and recovery eventually gave rise to the modern assemblage of species that we know today. In conclusion, era A, when dinosaurs were flourishing, exhibited a much greater level of biodiversity compared to era B, marked by the mass extinction event. While the extinction event led to the extinction of a large proportion of species, it also allowed for the evolution and diversification of new lineages, ultimately shaping the course of Earth's natural history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom. The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground. They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the \\"disturbing schools\\" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white. Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. \\"I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,\\" Johnson said in the statement. Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages. The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator. In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.

In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry..., can you guess it ?

On a hot summer afternoon, the First Savings Bank of Brooklyn is held up by Sonny Wortzik and Sal two down-and-out characters. Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery, Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal, as most of the cash has been picked up for the day. Sonny then gets an unexpected phone call from Police Captain Eugene Moretti, who tells him the place is surrounded by the city's entire police force. Having few options under the circumstances, Sonny nervously bargains with Moretti, demanding safe escort to the airport and a plane out of the country in return for the bank employees' safety. Written by alfiehitchieFirst-time crook Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his friend Sal (John Cazale) rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's boyfriend's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has very little money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Detective Moretti acts as hostage negotiator, while FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) monitors his actions. Howard (John Marriott), the security guard, has an asthma attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith.

Film company Lionsgate said it was \\"pleased\\" with the result, and noted there was little competition for the film's teen audience over Easter. Elsewhere, Sean Penn's action movie The Gunman fired a blank with US audiences. The star could only muster 5m (£3.3m) for the tough tale of Congo mercenaries, which he co-wrote and co-produced.

However, reviews were resoundingly negative.

This includes general cleaning tasks such as dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and tidying up rooms. Their responsibilities may also extend to other household chores such as doing the laundry, ironing clothes, and occasionally cooking or meal preparation, depending on the specific agreement between the maid and the employer. While some of the other choices mentioned, such as \\"iron shirts and trousers\\" and \\"clean room\\", are tasks that a maid may perform, these are just individual tasks within the overarching responsibility of maintaining and cleaning the house.

Public-private partnership is at the core of \\"the Swedish model\\", which was developed by the Social Democrats, who governed for most of the last 70 years until 2006. This mixed economy traditionally featured centralised wage negotiations and a heavily tax-subsidised social security network. The Swedes still enjoy an advanced welfare system, and their standard of living and life expectancy are almost second to none. Population 9.5 million Area 449,964 sq km (173,732 sq miles) Major language Swedish Major religion Christianity Life expectancy 80 years (men), 84 years (women) Currency krona King: Carl XVI Gustaf King Carl XVI Gustaf ascended the throne in 1973, on the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf. The current king's father died in a plane crash in 1947, when Carl Gustav was only nine months old. During his long royal apprenticeship, Carl Gustav underwent the usual military training, but also studied history, politics and economics at Swedish universities, served in the diplomatic corps, and worked in banking and commerce. Constitutional changes in 1974 deprived the king of all but ceremonial duties, such as opening parliament and representing Sweden at the diplomatic level. Prime minister: Stefan Lofven Former union boss Stefan Lofven heads a minority, centre-left coalition government made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party. He put together the coalition after parliamentary elections of September 2014, in which his party gained 31% of the votes and the Greens 7%. He promised he would seek wide support for his plans to boost welfare, schools and jobs. Mr Lofven was only elected to parliament in the elections which brought him to power. The former welder headed the Swedish Metalworkers' Union (IF Metall) between 2006 and 2012, when he was elected as leader of the Social Democrats. Swedish audiences enjoy a wide variety of public and commercial broadcast services. TV is the most-popular medium. Public Sveriges Television's (SVT) main competitor is commercial network TV4. Sweden is home to the regional media giants Bonnier and the Modern Times Group (MTG). Most households have multichannel cable or satellite TV. Sweden has made the switch to digital terrestrial TV (DTT) and pay TV is broadcast in the format. Public radio is run by Sveriges Radio. There are nearly 100 private radios; some are part of near-national networks. Some key dates in Sweden's history: 1905 - Union between Sweden and Norway peacefully dissolved, 90 years after Sweden invaded Norway. 1914 - Outbreak of World War I. Sweden remains neutral. 1920 - Sweden joins League of Nations. During the 1920s Sweden develops from an agricultural into an industrial society. Social democratic governments enact various social reforms. 1939 - At the outbreak of World War II, Sweden - along with its Scandinavian neighbours - declares its neutrality. 1946 - Sweden joins the United Nations. 1952 - Sweden becomes founder member of the Nordic Council, established to further the mutual interests of the Scandinavian countries. 1959 - Sweden becomes founder member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). 1994 - Swedes narrowly support EU membership in a referendum. Sweden joins the EU on 1st January 1995.","completion":"The Swedish model, developed by the Social Democrats who governed the country for most of the last 70 years, is at the core of Sweden's strong economy and low unemployment rate.

You may recall that it is a collection matter for about 1,800,000 for breach of spot gas purchase contracts by Triad. We tried to arbitrate, but Triad wouldn't answer the arbitration (even though I got calls from Purnell afterward, who asked if there was some way we could settle the arbitration). We then filed suit in the 125th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, against both Triad and Purnell, to see if that would smoke them out. As you know, after filing our original petition, we found an inadvertant technical error in it that required correction, and at no charge to you refiled a first amended petition that corrected the error. Since then, we served the first amended petition and citations on the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, as is allowed by law under such circumstances. The Secretary of State then forwarded the first amended petition and citations to the addresses we gave them, by certified mail, r.r.r. At this time, which is long after the expiration of the answer date, no certified mail receipt has reportedly been received by the Secretary of State from Purnell or Triad. No answer or other pleading has been filed by Triad or Purnell. This is not unexpected, given that Triad dodged us during the attempted arbitration. The caselaw supports the position that we have made effective service on both Triad and Purnell, although there is some room to argue that the Secretary of State has to receive a green card back, even if it is marked \\"refused\\". If we wanted to try to nail this point down by going to the additional expense of personal service on Triad and Purnell, we could, but if Purnell is not going to respond to registered mail, he will likely attempt to dodge personal service as well. I am not recommending it. We will shortly receive from the Secretary of State the so-called \\"Whitney Certificate\\" and file-stamped copies of the citations, which we will file with the court, along with a motion for entry of default judgment. I will make sure you see a draft before it is filed. We will need to set a hearing on our motion, and produce evidence of our damages. I would not expect the hearing to take more than an hour. We previously filed an affidavit signed by Bryce, as well as a matrix for computing our prejudgment interest (given that there were many spot gas sales, and prejudgement interest as to each would start at different times) prepared by Shielah Castro. I will follow up with them to see if they would be willing and available to come with me to testify at the hearing, and will of course fully prepare them beforehand. Also, I will need to testify regarding our attorneys' fees in this matter. Parenthetically, given the length of time this matter has been on file, it has been routinely set on the dismissal for want of prosecution docket. As you know, it is merely a formality and I will file the appropriate motion to get this taken care of. I will send you a draft of that if you wish. A hearing is set on this docket for October 23, at which time I presently have a conflict, and Bonnie has kindly agreed to attend in my place if necessary. No one else need be at that hearing.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Echoes of the Past Genre: Horror/Thriller Plot: Helen Young, a curious and ambitious graduate student, is pursuing her lifelong passion for urban legends and folklore at a prestigious university. Her latest research project focuses on the infamous Candyman, a vengeful spirit rumored to haunt an eerie, decaying apartment complex known as Cabrini Green. Working alongside her supportive boyfriend Michael and her knowledgeable yet guarded professor Dr. Thomas, Helen discovers the chilling tale of Candyman. Born as Daniel Robitaille, a talented black artist, he fell in love with a white woman against the social taboos of the 19th century. As a result, he was hunted down and brutally lynched by a furious mob. Cursed to avenge his horrific death, Daniel returned as the vengeful specter Candyman, haunting and tormenting anyone who dared summon him by chanting his name five times in front of a mirror. Unsatisfied with her findings, Helen feels compelled to dig deeper and prove that Candyman is nothing but a myth fueled by local anxieties. She visits Cabrini Green to interview the residents, most of whom are terrified by the mere mention of the ghastly figure. They share harrowing stories of unsolved murders and unsettling supernatural events, blaming the elusive Candyman for the violence that plagues their lives. Encounters with the charming but cryptic Clarice, an unassuming local woman with a mysterious connection to Candyman, lead Helen to question the disturbing connection between her past, the vengeful spirit, and the terrified residents of Cabrini Green. Driven to demystify the legend, Helen performs the forbidden ritual in front of a mirror, unconvinced of the consequences. Days later, Helen finds herself being stalked by Candyman, who terrorizes her in increasingly frightening ways. In an intense confrontation in a parking garage, the horrifying figure appears to Helen, confirming her worst fears and offering her a chilling ultimatum: join him in his afterlife, or watch him murder everyone she loves. Shattered by the encounter, Helen turns to a desperate Dr. Thomas for help. Together, they race against time to decipher a cryptic prophecy that holds the key to breaking the curse that binds Candyman to his eternal torment. As the vengeful spirit hunts her loved ones, Helen must use her extensive knowledge of urban legends to devise a plan to vanquish him forever. In a thrilling final confrontation, Helen discovers that Clarice is, in fact, a descendent of Candyman's lost lover, making her the key to freeing his soul. With everything hanging in the balance, Helen, Michael, Dr. Thomas, and Clarice come together in a deadly showdown at Cabrini Green. While they successfully break the curse and banish Candyman back to the afterlife, not everyone makes it out unscathed, leaving Helen to come to terms with the consequences of her choices and the darkness that lingers in the echoes of the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all.

At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom.

That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation.

One such teacher is Sharon Clomps who says of her students--\\"so passive\\" --and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes.

Subtract 135 from both sides of the equation: -15*k + 135 - 135 = 0 - 135 This simplifies to: -15*k = -135 Step 2. To isolate k, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -15. -15*k / -15 = -135 / -15 This simplifies to: k = 9 So, the answer to the equation -15*k + 60 + 22 + 53 = 0 for k is k = 9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who worked professionally in archaeology, and specialised in the Romano-British period? Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

The Beatles The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding the group's popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, \`\`Love Me Do'', in late 1962. They acquired the nickname \`\`the Fab Four'' as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the next year, and by early 1964 became international stars, leading the \`\`British Invasion'' of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (also known as the \`\`White Album'', 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed success as solo artists.

Does the word \\"run\\" have the same definition in the next two sentences? The crowd had to run away from the burning structure with only the clothes on their backs. If you see this man, run!","completion":"The word \\"run\\" appears to hold similar fundamental meanings in both sentences, but its usage and implications are different due to the contextual variations of both situations. In the first sentence, \\"The crowd had to run away from the burning structure with only the clothes on their backs,\\" the meaning of \\"run\\" is essentially focused on the act of running as an urgent means to escape a dangerous situation—the burning structure. In this case, the word \\"run\\" marks the crowd's hurried movement away from the life-threatening event, the fire. It is not only about the actual motion and speed of running but also conveys a sense of urgency, fear, and helplessness that the people involved must deal with in that moment. This act is mainly driven by the necessity to create distance from the hazard and find safety as soon as possible. In the second sentence, \\"If you see this man, run!\\" the word \\"run\\" also refers to the physical act of running as a response to a potential threat posed by the man mentioned. In this context, the term \\"run\\" serves as an imperative, advising the listener (or reader) to flee the situation hastily whenever they encounter the person described. Similarly, the context implies urgency and evokes a sense of fear or worry concerning the safety of the individual receiving the advice. However, unlike the first sentence, this sentence does not provide information about the severity or nature of the threat the man poses, making it somewhat open to interpretation. In conclusion, while both sentences use \\"run\\" with the primary meaning of engaging in a rapid way of walking or hastened movement, their contextual differences influence the urgency, fear, and distinct reasons behind running in each scenario. The first sentence discusses running as a necessary consequence of a dangerous event, while the second sentence implies the act of running as a cautionary reaction to an individual who may represent a threat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the fact that: As you go farther from the nucleus of an atom, the electron levels have more and more energy. Answer the question: Lonnie works in a lab. He is studying atoms and discovers that the electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving less. or more? The answer is:","completion":"The electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving more. To give a more comprehensive answer to this question, it is essential to understand the structure of an atom and its relation to the energy levels and the movement of electrons. An atom consists of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting around it. These electrons are arranged in different energy levels or electron shells, which can be thought of as concentric spheres surrounding the nucleus. Each electron shell can hold a particular number of electrons, and electrons within the same shell have approximately the same energy level. The movement of electrons is tied to their energy levels. As electrons are further away from the nucleus, they move in higher energy levels or electron shells. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, electrons with higher energy levels move faster than those with lower energy levels. This is because their energy is associated with motion, and thus, they need to move more rapidly to sustain such energy levels. Lonnie's observation of electrons moving less or more is essentially a study of electron energy and velocity. The increased distance of electrons from the nucleus corresponds to higher energy levels, which in turn results in faster-moving electrons. This relationship between distance, energy, and velocity can be explained through the following reasons: 1. Increased distance from the nucleus corresponds to a weaker electrostatic force between the electrons and the protons in the nucleus. To maintain their orbits and balance the centrifugal force resulting from their motion, electrons at a greater distance from the nucleus must move more quickly. 2. Electrons in higher energy levels have a larger range of possible movements. As an electron occupies a higher energy level, it can exist in a greater number of positions ranging from closer to the nucleus to farther away. This increased freedom of motion requires higher energy and, consequently, higher velocity. In summary, based on the fact that energy levels increase as one moves farther from the nucleus, Lonnie's observation of electrons moving less or more would indicate that electrons farther away from the nucleus move more due to their higher energy levels and need to counteract the weaker electrostatic force with the nucleus. This understanding of electron behavior aligns with the fundamental principles of atomic structure and quantum mechanics."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Washing clothes manually leads to what?

During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Which compounds combine in the presence of sunlight to form glucose?","completion":"To identify the compounds that combine during photosynthesis to form glucose, let's go through the process step-by-step: 1. Absorption of light energy: During photosynthesis, plants contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures light energy from the Sun. 2. Conversion of light energy: Light energy is used to split water molecules (H2O) through a process called photolysis. This process results in the production of oxygen (O2) and hydrogen ions (H+). 3. Formation of energy molecules: The hydrogen ions generated in the previous step, along with the light energy captured by chlorophyll, help produce energy molecules, namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). 4. Carbon fixation: In the presence of enzymes, plants utilize CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere in a process called carbon fixation, which occurs in the Calvin cycle. 5. Production of glucose: Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the Calvin cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, along with carbon dioxide, is used to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and other organic molecules. To sum up, in the presence of sunlight, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the main compounds that combine to form glucose (C6H12O6) during photosynthesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Additionally, the term could also imply that these women are sexually experienced, much like how cougars are known for their adept hunting capabilities in the wild. With age often comes maturity and experience in many aspects of life, including sexual and interpersonal relationships; thus, the association between older women and the term \\"cougar.\\" In conclusion, the term \\"cougar\\" as applied to older women who engage in relationships with significantly younger men is named after the cougar, a member of the cat family renowned for its hunting prowess and powerful presence. The term is meant to evoke the assertiveness, confidence, and experience that many older women possess, as well as their pursuit of younger men in romantic or sexual contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Passage:Gregory E. Stinson, better known as G. E. Stinson (born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma), is an American guitarist and founding member of new age/electronic musical group Shadowfax. Inspired by blues masters such as Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters, Stinson experimented with blues, jazz and other musical genres before co-founding Shadowfax in 1974. He remained with the band for six albums. He departed Shadowfax after recording The Odd Get Even (1989), entering the Los Angeles underground music community to refine his 'extended technique' and 'frequency manipulation'. Since then he has worked with a number of musicians on various projects, including Napalm Quartet, Splinter Group, Stinkbug, Metalworkers, Alex De Grassi, Devin Sarno and others. In 2000, he collaborated with drummer Gregg Bendian, violinist Jeff Gauthier, and bassist Steuart Liebig on an album of collective improvisational pieces recorded live in the studio, entitled Bone Structure.

His latest mission took him to relatively unknown waters off New Caledonia. As a child he was inspired by the work of prestigious explorer Jacques Cousteau. Previously he thought all hope was lost to restoring the seas, he has since changed his mind.","completion":"Title: Enric Sala: The Modern-Day Cousteau on a Mission to Restore the Seas Subtitle: National Geographic's Explorer-in-Residence Takes on the Depths of New Caledonia to Preserve the Ocean's Wonders Introduction: Enric Sala, National Geographic's renowned explorer-in-residence, has been on an incredible journey to not only explore but also to help restore the health of our planet's oceans. Drawing inspiration from the illustrious Jacques Cousteau, Sala has ventured into the relatively unknown waters off the coast of New Caledonia, striving to make a meaningful difference for the future of our seas. Step 1: Establish the background and inspiration of Enric Sala Growing up enamored by the work of Jacques Cousteau, Enric Sala's fascination with the ocean and its underwater universe led him to pursue a career in marine exploration and conservation. Cousteau's groundbreaking contributions to understanding, exploring, and preserving the sea ignited a passion in Sala, who would eventually follow in the footsteps of his childhood hero. Step 2: Describe the turning point in Sala's mindset Despite the mounting pressures facing our oceans, from pollution to rising temperatures, Sala at one time believed that it might be too late for humanity to right the wrongs inflicted upon our oceans. However, his optimism was rekindled, recognizing the importance of taking action now in order to protect and restore the seas for generations to come. Step 3: Introduce his latest mission to New Caledonia Sala's most recent adventure took him to the relatively uncharted waters off the coast of New Caledonia, a South Pacific territory known for its vibrant marine life and stunning coral reefs. Little is known about these waters, making Sala's expedition an important contribution to our understanding of this unique and complex ecosystem. Step 4: Explain the goals of Sala's mission As a pioneer in marine conservation, Sala's primary objective during his New Caledonia expedition was to explore, document, and ultimately devise strategies to protect and restore the region's rich biodiversity. With the world's coral reefs facing an existential crisis, Sala's work is all the more crucial in efforts to save these vital ecosystems. Step 5: Discuss the potential impact of his work Enric Sala's relentless drive to preserve the world's oceans is an inspiring testament to the human spirit. Should his efforts in New Caledonia prove successful, his work could be pivotal in inspiring others to join forces in safeguarding our planet's underwater treasures. By following in the footsteps of the great Cousteau, Sala is blazing a new trail for future generations of ocean explorers and conservationists, ensuring that the earth's marine ecosystems continue to thrive for years to come. Conclusion: Although Enric Sala once believed that restoring the seas was a lost cause, he has since changed his outlook and dedicated himself to the pursuit of oceanic preservation. Guided by the pioneering spirit of Jacques Cousteau, Sala's exploration and conservation efforts in New Caledonia are a shining beacon of hope for the future health of our oceans. As this modern-day Cousteau continues to push the boundaries of marine research, we are reminded of the wonder and fragility of the underwater world, and our collective responsibility to protect it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Prior to 1873, the silver dollar circulated in many parts of the world, with a value in relation to the British gold British sovereign coin of roughly 1 4s 2d (21p approx). As a result of the decision of the German Empire to stop minting silver thaler coins in 1871, in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, the worldwide price of silver began to fall. This resulted in the U.S. Coinage Act (1873) which put the United States onto a de facto gold standard. Canada and History of Newfoundland and Labrador were already on the gold standard, and the result was that the value of the dollar in North America increased in relation to silver dollars being used elsewhere, particularly Latin America and the Far East. By 1900, value of silver dollars had fallen to 50 percent of gold dollars. Following the abandonment of the gold standard by Canada in 1931, the Canadian dollar began to drift away from parity with the U.S. dollar. It returned to parity a few times, but since the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that was agreed to in 1944, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the U.S. dollar. The silver dollars of Latin America and South East Asia began to diverge from each other as well during the course of the 20th century. The Straits dollar adopted a gold exchange standard in 1906 after it had been forced to rise in value against other silver dollars in the region. Hence, by 1935, when China and Hong Kong came off the silver standard, the Straits dollar was worth 2s 4d (11.5p approx) Pound sterling, whereas the Hong Kong dollar was worth only 1s 3d sterling (6p approx).

How can I know what my comfort zone is? How can I come out of my comfort zone? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, but they are related. The first question is about identifying your comfort zone, while the second question is about stepping out of it. Here is a detailed explanation for both questions: 1. How can I know what my comfort zone is? Your comfort zone is a mental and emotional state where you feel familiar, safe, at ease, and in control of your environment and circumstances. It defines the boundary between activities or situations that you find comfortable and those that you consider challenging or threatening. To identify your comfort zone, you can follow these steps: a. Self-reflection: Spend some time contemplating your life, routines, and experiences. Identify patterns of situations and activities that consistently cause you discomfort, anxiety, or stress. b. Journaling: Writing down your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors will make it easier for you to spot your comfort zone boundaries. Record the activities that you find enjoyable and those that you avoid or feel hesitant to undertake. c. List your fears and anxieties: Prepare a list of situations, people, or things that make you feel afraid, stressed, or anxious. This could include public speaking, meeting new people, trying out new activities, or dealing with failure. d. Seek feedback: Talk to people who know you well, such as friends, family members, or colleagues. Ask them to help you identify your comfort zone by sharing their observations about your habits, behavior, and reactions to different situations. e. Assess your emotional reactions: Pay attention to your emotions when faced with new or challenging experiences. If you feel a strong resistance, fear, or anxiety, it's likely that you are encountering the edge of your comfort zone. 2. How can I come out of my comfort zone? To step out of your comfort zone, you need to push your boundaries, face your fears, and be open to experiencing discomfort. Here are some suggestions to help you do this: a. Set challenging goals: Identify personal or professional goals that force you to step outside your existing comfort zone. This could include developing a new skill, joining a social club, or volunteering for a challenging assignment at work. b. Take small steps: Gradually increase your tolerance for discomfort by starting with smaller challenges and working your way up as you become more comfortable. This method will help you build confidence and create positive momentum. c. Embrace failure: Accept that setbacks and failures are a natural part of personal growth. Be willing to face the possibility of failure as a valuable learning experience that can help you grow and improve. d. Develop a growth mindset: Cultivate the belief that you can improve, learn, and develop new skills and abilities. A growth mindset will help you be more open to pushing your boundaries and taking on new challenges. e. Seek support: Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who encourage you to step outside your comfort zone. Having a strong support network will make it easier for you to face challenges and overcome fear. f. Practice mindfulness: Learn to be present in the moment and accept your feelings of discomfort without judgment. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, can help you relax and be more receptive to new experiences. By understanding your comfort zone and learning how to step out of it, you can unlock new opportunities for personal and professional growth, gain greater self-awareness, and lead a more fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?, using the article: Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer to the question regarding the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses is: both works are titled \\"Euridice.\\" These two compositions with the same name were created by two different composers, Jacopo Peri and Giulio Caccini. These works are considered direct precursors to Monteverdi's famous opera, L'Orfeo. The Euridice operas by Peri and Caccini emerged during a time when innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio – a form of musical interlude inserted between acts of spoken dramas – into increasingly elaborate forms. This innovation eventually led to the creation of the opera genre, as evidenced by works like Dafne, composed by Jacopo Corsi and Jacopo Peri, which was performed in Florence in 1598. Peri's and Caccini's compositions of Euridice incorporated elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages, creating a dramatic whole that would pave the way for subsequent representations of the Orpheus myth in music, including Monteverdi's L'Orfeo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ending weeks of political speculation, Marco Rubio announced Wednesday he has changed his mind and will run for re-election to the U.S. Senate, reversing his pledge to return to private life after his presidential campaign collapsed three months ago. His decision could give Republicans an edge in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country — and keep Rubio in the public eye ahead of the next presidential election in 2020. Rubio cited a sense of duty to try to remain in Congress under either President Donald Trump or President Hillary Clinton, two candidates he considers mediocre. “No matter who’s elected president, there’s reason to worry. If it’s Hillary Clinton, you know we’re going to have four more years of the same failed economic policies, four more years of the same failed foreign policy,” he told the Miami Herald. “The prospect of a Trump presidency is also worrisome to me in many ways.” 20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now! Rubio has said he’ll vote for Trump. If Trump wins, Rubio said that as a senator he would “encourage him in the right direction, but if it’s necessary, stand up to him.” “It’s no secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald,” he said. “And his positions on many key issues are unknown, and many of the statements — especially about women and minorities — are statements that I find not just offensive but unacceptable.” National Republicans fearful of losing Senate control to Democrats mounted a campaign to keep Rubio on the ballot for Florida’s swing seat. He consented just two days before Friday’s qualifying deadline, pointing to the Senate’s “check and balance on the excesses of the president.” SHARE COPY LINK Marco Rubio bids farewell to his presidential campaign at Florida International University after losing the Florida primary to Donald Trump on Tuesday, March 15, 2016. He made no commitments about his future ambitions, declining to say if he’d serve a full, six-year term — or run again for president in 2020 or 2024. “What I’m done making is unequivocal statements about anything at this point,” he said. “I don’t even know who the next president’s going to be. But I will say this to you: If I wanted to run for president in 2020, running for re-election in 2016 was probably not the best choice to make politically.” Rubio’s decision carries some political risk. He has only a couple of months to organize a campaign and pitch himself again to voters, some of whom start casting ballots in July for the Aug. 30 primary. If he wins, he could substantially boost his chance to become a future presidential candidate. If he loses, he undermines his political career with two major failures in a single year, perhaps forcing him to abandon his White House ambitions. “It’s never been a goal of mine to lose two elections in a year,” Rubio said. “It’s going to be a tough race. I have no illusions about that.” Rubio’s announcement quickly upended the GOP primary contest to replace him: Two of his would-be rivals, Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, left the race, with DeSantis choosing to run for re-election instead. Two other competitors, Sarasota developer Carlos Beruff and Orlando defense contractor Todd Wilcox, remain — though Rubio became the instant front-runner. With his widespread name recognition and broad donor network, Rubio would pose a stiffer challenge to the leading Democratic candidates, U.S. Reps. Patrick Murphy of Jupiter and Alan Grayson of Orlando, who had benefited from the lack of a GOP leader. Rubio’s announcement came within hours of the release of a new Quinnipiac University poll that showed he’s the only Republican with a shot at defeating Grayson or Murphy in November, when the electorate will likely skew Democratic. Democrats accused Rubio of playing politics with the crucial seat. Marco Rubio abandoned his constituents, and now he’s treating them like a consolation prize. U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter “Marco Rubio abandoned his constituents, and now he’s treating them like a consolation prize,” Murphy said in a statement. “From missing the most votes of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years, to seeking to ban abortion even in cases of rape or incest, to repeatedly voting against closing the terrorist gun loophole, Rubio is proving he is only out for himself.” Grayson’s campaign manager, Mike Ceraso, in a statement called Rubio “No Show Marco,” a reference to the senator’s many missed votes while on the campaign trail. Rubio had been adamant after his presidential bid failed that he would not return to Washington, which he has disdained as dysfunctional and ineffective. The 45-year-old seemed intent on a spending a few lucrative years in the private sector. Yet his reversal is hardly surprising. Rubio went back to Capitol Hill after his crushing March 15 loss in the Florida primary with renewed interest in the job — and an aggressive public-relations campaign to highlight it. He granted numerous interviews about his work. He traveled extensively in Florida, focusing on issues such as Everglades restoration and Zika prevention. And he repeated over and over again, often unprompted, that he didn’t “hate” the Senate. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the National Republican Senatorial Committee took it all as a sign that Rubio might be open to their overtures. In interviews, Rubio started sounding increasingly like a man sitting out the race chiefly because his friend was in it — not because he wasn’t interested. “Maybe,” he told CNN in May. Then, after last week’s massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub, Rubio told a radio talk-show host he’d been given “pause” to reconsider his Senate role. He met with Lopez-Cantera, who gave Rubio the go-ahead to run. “Had that conversation not happened,” Rubio said of his talk with Lopez-Cantera, “this conversation we’re having now would have never happened.” On Monday, Rubio voted against a measure to block gun sales to suspected terrorists. Democrats charged Rubio with using the mass shooting to neatly justify his political plans. Rubio, who was careful not to mention the tragedy in the Herald interview, said Orlando made him think, “Where is it that you want to be in life, and what do you find rewarding?” Though Rubio seemed to deliberately position himself so he could seek re-election, he and his friends contend the move was never calculated and the timing wasn’t opportunistic. Until just a couple of weeks ago, they say, Rubio had no intention to return to the Senate. Several friends said when Rubio started reconsidering, they advised him to stick to his original plan. “He’s got four kids under the age of 16,” said Miami-Dade County Commissioner Esteban “Steve” Bovo, who served with Rubio in the Florida House of Representatives. “Politically it’s probably the riskiest thing he could do.... It’s no shoo-in for Marco.” He made up his mind with his family over Father’s Day weekend, Rubio said. The senator, who’s always had a knack for building political suspense, extended the drama by taking until Wednesday to make an announcement. His backers had said they expected a decision by Sunday. Then Monday. Then Tuesday. The prolonged intrigue set off a flurry of political dominoes among Florida Republicans. U.S. Rep. David Jolly of Indian Shores left the Senate race Friday and will instead seek re-election to his St. Petersburg congressional seat, challenging former Gov. Charlie Crist in a redrawn district that now favors Democrats. DeSantis, of Ponte Vedra Beach, will run again in Florida’s 6th congressional district. Lopez-Cantera, of Miami, will remain lieutenant governor. He’s doing this for the greater good. Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera “He’s doing this for the greater good,” Lopez-Cantera said Wednesday. “Before today, I was our best chance to keep the seat Republican. But if Marco runs then he’s our best chance. That’s more important.” He urged Beruff and Wilcox to leave the race. Beruff and Wilcox, though — who are both independently wealthy — say they’re prepared to challenge Rubio in the primary. Beruff has indicated he’s prepared to tar Rubio, who was a tea-party favorite when he was first elected to office in 2010, as part of the Republican establishment that many voters now disdain. “Career politicians like Marco Rubio worry more about keeping the job than doing the job, and are constantly looking for their next political promotion,” Beruff said in a statement Wednesday. Outside of Beruff and Wilcox, however, Florida GOP leaders and down-ballot candidates were giddy at the prospect of having Rubio back on the ticket. They see Rubio, the only Senate candidate who has run statewide, as a buffer to Trump in Florida. The presumptive GOP nominee has seen his popularity fall in recent polls, and party leaders worry he could be a drag on state and local races. Clinton leads Trump 47-39 percent in Florida, a Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday showed — her largest lead since the pollster starting asking voters about a Clinton-Trump match-up in 2015. “I’m very encouraged by the news Sen. Rubio will seek re-election,” said state Rep. Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, who is hoping to become House speaker from 2018-2020. “His decision will have important ramifications on the election and, more importantly, on our ability to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will hold to our Constitution.” Political groups plan to spend tens of millions of dollars in the Florida Senate race. Rubio will have to start fundraising from scratch. As of the end of May, he had only about 24,000 left over in his presidential campaign account and was about 1.9 million in debt. But major Republican groups are also expected to step in to help Rubio. That’s part of the promise party leaders made in courting him for re-election. “There is literally one person in America who has the ability to dramatically increase the chances of Republicans keeping the majority — Marco Rubio,” said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund and a former McConnell chief of staff. “If Marco’s in for Florida, we’re in for Florida, it’s just that simple.” Herald/Times reporters Michael Auslen, Kristen Clark and Jeremy Wallace, and Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Alex Leary, contributed to this report. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A poll released Wednesday gives U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one more reason to run for re-election: He's running ahead of the Democrats. The Quinnipiac University Poll found Rubio leading Democrat Patrick Murphy, 47 percent to 40 percent. He leads Democrat Alan Grayson 48 percent to 40 percent. Murphy, a congressman from northern Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties, is the preferred candidate of Democratic Party leaders, including President Barack Obama. Grayson is an Orlando congressman popular with the liberal wing of the party. The Quinnipiac poll measured potential November election matchups, not the Aug. 30 primary contests in which Democrats and Republicans will pick their nominees. The poll found Murphy and Grayson are running well ahead of the candidates for the Republican Senate nomination: Carlos Beruff, a Bradenton home builder; Ron DeSantis, a congressman from Ponte Vedra Beach; Carlos Lopez-Cantera, the state lieutenant governor from Miami-Dade County; and Todd Wilcox, an Orlando businessman. Republican leaders, including presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, see Rubio as the party's best hope of holding the U.S. Senate seat in November, when a few state elections will determine which party controls the Senate. \\"Will Marco come to the rescue of the GOP?\\" asked Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, in a written analysis of the results. \\"With Republican national leaders worried about keeping control of the U.S. Senate, Sen. Marco Rubio might ride to their rescue ... he could be in the driver's seat.\\" Rubio's re-election run marks a major political reversal. For more than a year — starting when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination March 2015 — Rubio insisted he wouldn't run for re-election. He said he'd either be headed for the White House or becoming a private citizen. But three months after he dropped out of the presidential nomination — and faced with a Friday deadline to get on the ballot as a Senate candidate — Rubio announced Wednesday he will run. The poll found Democrats would overwhelmingly support either Murphy or Grayson and Republicans would overwhelmingly support Rubio. People who identify themselves as independent voters break for Rubio. Independents go for Rubio 47 percent to 39 percent over Murphy and support Rubio 49 percent to 38 percent for Grayson. Quinnipiac reported that the gender and racial gaps that mark the presidential race in Florida between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are also present in the Senate race, though on a smaller scale. For example, in a matchup between Republican Rubio and Democrat Murphy, men support Rubio 51 percent to 36 percent. Women are split, with 44 percent for Rubio and 42 percent for Murphy. White voters favor the Republican, 56 percent to 33 percent; nonwhite voters favor the Democrat, 55 percent to 30 percent. Quinnipiac said the same is true in a Rubio-Grayson matchup. Overall, voters' views about whether Rubio should be re-elected haven't changed much since a Feb. 10, 2015, Quinnipiac Poll. When voters were asked in that survey to look ahead to the 2016 election, 44 percent said Rubio deserved to be re-elected and 37 percent said he didn't deserve re-election. Approval ratings Voters are evenly divided over Rubio's performance, with 45 percent approving of his job performance and 44 percent disapproving. That marks an bit of an improvement for Rubio, whose home state approval rating had dipped during the course of his presidential campaign. During the last 10 months, he went from a net 21 percent positive to 1 percent positive. In May, Quinnipiac found 42 percent of Florida voters approved of his performance and 49 percent disapproved — putting him in negative territory for the first time since he was elected to the Senate in 2010. In August 2015, home state voters gave him a 57 percent approval rating with 36 percent disapproving. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., fares better than Rubio. For Nelson, 55 percent of Florida voters approve of his job performance and 22 percent disapprove. Gov. Rick Scott has one of his best scores ever, Quinnipiac said, with 43 percent approving of his performance and 46 percent disapproving. \\"Surprisingly, Republican Gov. Rick Scott also is enjoying some Florida sunshine,\\" Brown said. \\"Scott has spent most of his six years as governor with negative approval ratings. In this survey he is just about even.\\" And President Barack Obama is enjoying his best numbers since December 2012, the month after he won re-election. Florida voters give him a 54 percent approval rating with 42 percent disapproving of his job performance. Potential Senate matchups • Grayson 40, Rubio 48. • Grayson 40, Beruff 33. • Grayson 40, Lopez-Cantera 35. • Grayson 41, DeSantis 33. • Grayson 39, Wilcox 34. • Murphy 40, Rubio 47. • Murphy 43, Beruff 31. • Murphy 41, Lopez-Cantera 32. • Murphy 42, DeSantis, 32. • Murphy 41, Wilcox 31. Quinnipiac surveyed 975 Florida voters over land lines and cell phones from June 8-19. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey; it's higher for smaller groups, such as female voters, because the sample size is smaller. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Ending weeks of political speculation, Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday that he will run for re-election to the U.S. Senate.

In music, sampling is the act of taking a portion, or sample, of one sound recording and reusing it as an instrument or a sound recording in a different song or piece. Sampling was originally developed by experimental musicians working with musique concrete and electroacoustic music, who physically manipulated tape loops or vinyl records on a phonograph. By the late 1960s, the use of tape loop sampling influenced the development of minimalist music and the production of psychedelic rock and jazz fusion. Hip hop music was the first popular music genre based on the art of sampling - being born from 1970s DJs who experimented with manipulating vinyl on two turntables and an audio mixer. Usually taken from movies, television, or other non-musical media, spoken word samples are often used to create atmosphere, to set a mood, or even comic effect. The American composer Steve Reich used samples from interviews with Holocaust survivors as a source for the melodies on the 1988 album Different Trains, performed by the Kronos Quartet. Many genres utilize sampling of spoken word to induce a mood, and Goa trance often employs samples of people speaking about the use of psychoactives, spirituality, or science fiction themes. Industrial is known for samples from horror/sci-fi movies, news broadcasts, propaganda reels, and speeches by political figures. The band Ministry frequently samples George W. Bush. Paul Hardcastle used recordings of a news reporter, as well as a soldier and ambient noise of a protest, in his single \\"Nineteen,\\" a song about Vietnam war veterans and Posttraumatic stress disorder. The band Negativland samples from practically every form of popular media, ranging from infomercials to children's records. In the song \\"Civil War\\", Guns N' Roses samples from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke, on the album Use Your Illusion II. Sludge band Dystopia make frequent use of samples, including news clips and recordings of junkies to create a bleak and nihilistic atmosphere. Other bands that frequently used samples in their work are noise rockers Steel Pole Bath Tub and death metal band Skinless. The extreme metal band Mortician makes extensive usage of horror movie samples, which can sometimes be longer than the actual song itself. The American rapper and producer MF Doom frequently uses spoken word samples, taken from anything from old Spider-Man and Fantastic Four cartoons to Charles Bukowski's \\"Dinosauria, We\\" poem. Oasis used a clip from a John Lennon interview for their song \\"I'm Outta Time\\". Living Colour samples Malcolm X, John F. Kennedy, and Franklin D.

As the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and later the President of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev served as the leader of the USSR from 1985 until its dissolution in 1991. Recognized for his transformative policies, Gorbachev implemented key reforms, including \\"Glasnost\\" (openness) and \\"Perestroika\\" (restructuring), which contributed to the end of the Cold War era and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Under Gorbachev's leadership, Glasnost allowed for an unprecedented level of openness and public dialogue on previously sensitive or restricted topics. This policy fostered increased transparency and freedom of speech, which eventually helped break down the long-standing barriers against criticism of the Soviet political system, its leaders, and the Communist Party's historical actions. Initially, the Soviet intelligentsia approached the new atmosphere of openness with caution before eventually pushing the boundaries of permitted dialogue. Gorbachev's ground-breaking tactic of appealing directly to the people for support in exchange for the expansion of liberties had an overall positive impact on advancing political reform in the Soviet Union. However, it also led to unintended consequences, as an increase in public discussion and criticism of the system played a significant role in the weakening and eventual downfall of the Soviet Union. In summary, the first leader mentioned within the context provided is Mikhail Gorbachev, whose radical expansion of the scope of Glasnost ultimately challenged the established norms of the Soviet Union and led to significant societal and political changes. While the reformist policies of Gorbachev inadvertently contributed to the decline of the Soviet system, they also helped to bring about an end to the Cold War era and set the stage for a new chapter in global history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: NEW YORK DAILY NEWS STAFF Sunday, May 8, 2016, 10:18 PM Jose Reyes’ punishment from MLB should be expected soon, and the Rockies shortstop is likely to receive a 60-game suspension, perhaps more, for his role in an alleged domestic violence incident, according to Jon Heyman of MLB Network. Reyes was arrested in Maui on Oct. 31 after he allegedly beat and shoved his wife, Katherine Ramirez in a hotel room, according to a police report. Ramirez had told police that Reyes grabbed her throat and shoved her through a sliding glass door during an argument in their hotel room. Hotel employees reported that Ramirez had injuries to her neck, wrist and thighs. Reyes pleaded not guilty but the criminal charges were soon dropped after lack of cooperation from Ramirez. He was placed on paid administrative leave by MLB as they conducted their own investigation. Reyes is owed 44 million over the next two seasons on his current contract, but it remains possible the Rockies could cut Reyes once the suspension is announced.

Toast a hamburger bun","completion":"To toast a hamburger bun, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather the necessary equipment and ingredients To toast the hamburger bun, you'll need: - A hamburger bun (either store-bought or homemade) - A toaster, toaster oven, or a stovetop with a pan - Butter or a suitable substitute (optional, but recommended for better taste and texture) Step 2: Prepare the hamburger bun Slice the hamburger bun in half horizontally if it isn't already pre-sliced, using a bread knife or a serrated knife. Step 3: Select your toasting method Choose between a toaster, toaster oven, or stovetop with a pan. Each method will yield slightly different results, so it's a matter of personal preference. Step 4: Applying butter (optional) Generously spread a layer of butter or a suitable substitute onto the cut side of the hamburger bun halves, ensuring each surface is covered evenly. This step is optional but recommended, as it adds flavor and improves texture. Toasting Method 1: Toaster 1. Adjust the toasting setting on your toaster to the desired level of crispiness (usually a setting between 3 to 4). 2. Place the bun halves, with the cut-side facing up, in the toaster. 3. Start the toaster and wait for it to complete the toasting process. This should take a few minutes. 4. Carefully remove the bun halves from the toaster, and allow them to cool slightly before handling them. Toasting Method 2: Toaster Oven 1. Preheat your toaster oven to 350°F (175°C). 2. Place the bun halves on a baking sheet or tray, with the cut-side facing up. 3. Place the tray in the preheated toaster oven for around 3-5 minutes, or until they reach your preferred level of browning. 4. Carefully remove the bun halves from the toaster oven, and allow them to cool slightly before handling them. Toasting Method 3: Stovetop with a Pan 1. Preheat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. 2. If you haven't applied butter to the buns, add some butter or oil to the pan to prevent sticking. 3. Place the hamburger bun halves, cut-side down, onto the pan or griddle. 4. Toast the bun halves for 2-4 minutes or until they're golden brown and crispy, adjusting the heat if needed. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning. 5. Once the desired level of browning is achieved, carefully remove the bun halves from the pan, and allow them to cool slightly before handling them. Step 5: Assemble the burger After toasting the hamburger bun, you can continue to assemble your burger by adding your preferred ingredients, like burger patties, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and condiments. Remember to handle the toasted buns carefully, as they might be hot and to protect your fingers from burns.

When we review the available options, our task is to pick the one that aligns most logically with the task of designing and constructing a terrace. Let's evaluate each option: 1) Rice Paddy: A rice paddy would not be an appropriate choice because it refers to a type of agricultural field where rice is grown. This is very distinct from the process of designing and creating a terrace. 2) Financial Firm: Financial firms offer services related to money management, investments, and financial planning. These establishments do not engage in physical construction or architectural design. 3) Architecture Firm: An architectural firm designs and creates plans for structures like buildings, homes, and also landscaping, which includes terraces. They have the knowledge, skills, and tools to produce aesthetic and functional designs. This corresponds directly with the description in the question of a \\"terrace [that] was ornate and artfully laid out.\\" 4) Michigan: Michigan is a state in the United States. While it might host various types of firms (including architectural ones), as a geographical location it does not bear direct relevance to the act of creating a terrace. 5) House: House here seems to refer to a residential building, rather than a type of firm. A house cannot create a terrace; rather, it could possess a terrace if it was constructed or remodeled by builders, likely working under the design guidance of an architecture firm. Given these considerations, a human would choose \\"architecture\\" as the answer because an architecture firm is the most reasonable and logical choice. The design and creation of a terrace—an ornate and artfully laid out one in particular—align with the core competencies and functions of an architecture firm.

Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened. He readily confessed when confronted by HR, further destroying his work record/career. Question: How long did it take for HR to fire the engineer after finding he committed the crime? Answer: A:","completion":"The text does not provide information on how long it took for HR to fire the engineer after finding he committed the crime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you know how much? Does it feel humid to you? You have heard all these questions before. To answer these questions, we need data. That data comes from special tools. These tools collect data about the weather. You can see some of the common tools listed below: A thermometer measures temperature. An anemometer measures wind speed. A rain gauge measures the amount of rain. A hygrometer measures humidity. A wind vane shows wind direction. A snow gauge measures the amount of snow. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What can data tell us?\\" is \\"Everything we want to know\\"?","completion":"Data can provide us with valuable insights and information about a wide range of topics, including weather as mentioned in the paragraph. It is not entirely accurate to say that data can tell us \\"Everything we want to know,\\" as there will always be certain limitations and unknowns in any field of study or inquiry. However, data is critical in helping us understand, analyze, and make informed decisions based on the available information. In the context of weather, data gathered from various tools such as thermometers, anemometers, rain gauges, hygrometers, wind vanes, and snow gauges helps meteorologists to understand and predict weather patterns, plan for natural disasters, and make recommendations to the public about potential hazards or precautions to take. Access to accurate and timely weather data can be vital for agriculture, aviation, shipping, outdoor events, and public safety. Moreover, data can also be a valuable asset in numerous other fields, such as healthcare, finance, education, sports, and transportation. With advancements in technology, we can now collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data, which has given rise to the field of data science and opened up numerous possibilities for organizations and individuals to gain insights and better understand complex patterns. However, it is essential to recognize that data on its own is not sufficient; we need skilled professionals who can clean, process, interpret, and analyze data from various sources. Furthermore, it's crucial to have appropriate context and understanding while interpreting data, as it can often be misleading or misinterpreted if not handled with care. Privacy concerns and ethical issues are other considerations that need to be addressed while collecting, storing, and using data. In conclusion, data is an essential tool that can reveal a wealth of information and help us better understand various aspects of the world around us. While data may not provide answers to every possible question, it plays a crucial role in expanding our knowledge and driving informed decisions in different domains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica worked zero jobs.; b. Patricia worked zero jobs.;","completion":"b. Patricia worked zero jobs. Jessica had to pay a lot in taxes unlike Patricia because Patricia worked zero jobs. This sentence highlights the difference in the financial situations and tax burdens faced by the two individuals due to their respective work statuses. Taxes play a crucial role in any country's economy, as they provide the government with the necessary funding required for public services and infrastructure development. The amount of taxes an individual has to pay generally depends on their income and a range of other factors. In this instance, Jessica presumably has a steady income, either from one or multiple jobs, and thus must pay taxes according to her income bracket. On the other hand, Patricia does not have any jobs, and her income might consist of savings, financial investments, or informal work not yielding significant revenues. This lack of regular employment reduces her overall income, placing her in a lower tax bracket or potentially allowing her to be exempt from paying income taxes altogether. It is important to note that there are various aspects to individual taxation, such as deductions and credits, which can also impact the amount a person owes. Moreover, the taxation system typically incorporates progressive rates, meaning that higher earners are subject to higher tax rates. This is intended to promote income redistribution and ensure that people with higher earnings contribute more towards the public budget. In summary, the sentence highlights the differences between Jessica and Patricia's financial situations and their corresponding tax obligations. Jessica, with her regular income, is required to pay more in taxes, while Patricia, who works zero jobs and possibly has a lower income, is subject to a lesser tax burden or is not required to pay taxes at all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans. The deal was finally completed on July 12, with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy. On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103-99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102-90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110-99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.","completion":"This text is about Kevin Maurice Garnett, an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA)."},{"prompt":"Process: - Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area - Waters warm up which hurts the fish swimming in them. suppose lack of rain leaves the forest dry and a campfire is not extinguished correctly happens, how will it affect less birds will fly away.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the recycling process for aluminum cans begins with the collection of used cans from various sources such as homes, offices, schools, and recycling bins located in public areas. These cans are then transported to a treatment plant for further processing. This step is crucial for efficiently managing waste and promoting recycling, as aluminum is a valuable and widely used material that can be repeatedly recycled without losing its quality. During the collection process, it is important to ensure that aluminum cans are separated from other waste materials like plastic, glass, or paper. This can be done by having dedicated recycling bins for aluminum cans, or by implementing waste sorting programs that educate the public about separating different types of recyclable materials. Once aluminum cans are collected and delivered to the treatment plant, they undergo a series of steps to clean, sort, and prepare them for reprocessing. This may include: 1. Sorting: Aluminum cans are separated from other materials (if not already done in the collection process) using a combination of manual labor and automated machines like conveyor belts and magnetic separators. 2. Cleaning: The cans are cleaned to remove any residual liquid, food particles, or other contaminants. This may be done using water, air, or other cleaning solutions. 3. Crushing or shredding: To save space and make transportation easier, the cans are usually crushed or shredded into small, compact pieces. 4. Reprocessing: The aluminum pieces are then melted in a large furnace, creating molten aluminum. This remelting process allows the aluminum to be refined and eliminates any impurities. 5. Cooling and casting: The molten aluminum is poured into molds and formed into large blocks called ingots. These ingots are allowed to cool and harden. 6. Rolling: The ingots are sent to mills, where they are heated and rolled out into thin sheets. These sheets are then coiled and transported to manufacturing facilities. 7. New products: The thin aluminum sheets are then used to create new products, such as cans, foil, automotive components, and many other items. The recycling process reduces waste, conserves resources, and contributes to a more sustainable future. By collecting and processing used aluminum cans, not only do we reduce the amount of materials that end up in landfills, but we also decrease the demand for freshly mined aluminum, which can have significant environmental impacts. A great benefit to recycling aluminum is that it can be processed and reused infinitely, making it an optimal material for sustainable practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: You will be given two sentences. One of them is created by paraphrasing the original one, with changes on an aspect, or using synonyms. Your task is to decide what is the difference between two sentences. Types of change are explained below: Tense: The verbs in the sentence are changed in tense. Number: Plural nouns, verbs and pronouns are changed into single ones or the other way around. Voice: If the verbs are in active voice, they're changed to passive or the other way around. Adverb: The paraphrase has one adverb or more than the original sentence. Gender: The paraphrase differs from the original sentence in the gender of the names and pronouns. Synonym: Some words or phrases of the original sentence are replaced with synonym words or phrases. Changes in the names of people are also considered a synonym change. Classify your answers into Tense, Number, Voice, Adverb, Gender, and Synonym.

Sentence 1: It's for jewellery, I believe, but there might be something else in it. The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched inside. Sentence 2: Julius opened it up and looked inside. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"In evaluating the truth of both sentences, it is important to examine the context, events, and conditions of each statement. Let's break down each sentence and analyze them separately before comparing them. Sentence 1: \\"It's for jewellery, I believe, but there might be something else in it. The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched inside.\\" - In this sentence, it is suggested that the object in question is likely meant for jewelry, but there could be something else within it too. The sentence goes on to describe that Julius finds the key in the lock, opens the door, and proceeds to search inside the object. Sentence 2: \\"Julius opened it up and looked inside.\\" - This sentence describes Julius' action of opening the object and looking inside. This sentence is more concise than the first one, and it does not provide any information on what the object is meant for or if there was a key found in a lock. Now, let's try to assess if the second sentence is true, assuming that the first one is true. From the first sentence, we know that Julius opened the door with the key found in the lock and searched inside. Considering this information as a series of events, we can reason that after finding the key in the lock and opening the door, Julius must have looked inside. In this scenario, one could argue that \\"looking inside\\" is equivalent to Julius \\"searching inside\\" as described in the first sentence. From this perspective, it is reasonable to say that the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Both sentences describe, albeit with varying amounts of detail, that Julius opened the object and engaged in some form of observation or exploration of its contents. The first sentence provides more context and detail on what the object might contain and the method by which Julius opened it, whereas the second sentence is a more straightforward description of Julius' actions (opening the object and looking inside). Given this, if we accept the first sentence's depiction of events as true, we can also conclude that the second sentence is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions.

Write a text based on \\"voting underway in azerbaijan 's controversial election\\" Text:","completion":"Title: The Complex Scenario of Azerbaijan's Controversial Election: Voting Underway Amidst High Tensions Introduction: As voting gets underway in Azerbaijan's highly debated election, the atmosphere in the nation continues to be tense. The controversial election has been widely discussed due to several factors, including allegations of government oppression, irregularities in the voting process, and concerns over the outcome's potential impact on regional stability. The election has drawn the attention of international observers and has led to a debate on the importance of democracy, human rights, and transparency in the election process. Background of the Controversy: The controversy over the elections in Azerbaijan can be traced back to several key issues. First, critics argue that the ruling party has maintained a stronghold on power, limiting the role of opposition parties and suppressing dissent. This has created a one-sided political playing field that lacks checks-and-balances and raises concerns over the fairness of the elections. Secondly, there have been reports of election fraud and irregularities in the past, casting doubt over the integrity and reliability of the voting process in Azerbaijan. These irregularities include instances of ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and manipulation of voter information. Some have argued that these tactics serve the interests of the ruling party, undermining the democratic principles that should govern any election process. Lastly, geopolitical tensions in the region have raised concerns over the election's implications for broader stability. Given Azerbaijan's strategic position in the Caucasus, bordering countries like Iran, Russia, and Turkey, the outcome of the election could have significant repercussions in international relations and may influence regional dynamics. The State of Voting in Azerbaijan: As the voting process commences, concerns have persisted regarding the transparency and fairness of the election. International observers are on the lookout for signs of irregularities and any issues that may compromise the authenticity of the vote. Concerns have also been voiced about the possibility of repression, with reports of opposition figures being silenced or intimidated as they attempt to participate in the voting process. Despite these challenges, some citizens still maintain hope for a fair and democratic election. It has been reported that voter turnout is higher than expected, potentially signaling a strong desire for change and the belief that their voice can make a difference in the electoral outcome. While the voting process is taking place, it remains to be seen whether the election will be a legitimate reflection of the will of the Azerbaijani people or will be defined by ongoing allegations of fraud and intimidation. International Response and Implications: As the world watches Azerbaijani's controversial election unfold, many international actors are carefully analyzing the situation. Praise for the high voter turnout is often accompanied by calls for increased transparency in the electoral process and respect for democratic principles. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is one of the key international observers in the election. Their role will be crucial in determining the credibility and legitimacy of the vote, as well as addressing any concerns that arise from the voting process. Ultimately, the outcome of the Azerbaijani election will have implications not only for the country's domestic politics but also for the broader regional and international landscape. The extent of electoral transparency and adherence to democratic principles may serve as a litmus test for future political developments in Azerbaijan and throughout the region. Conclusion: As Azerbaijan's controversial election grips the nation and the world, many are looking to the vote as a test of the country's commitment to democratic ideals and a sign of its future trajectory. Despite concerns over government repression, voting irregularities, and regional tensions, the Azerbaijani people have demonstrated a strong desire for political change and an opportunity to exercise their right to vote. It remains to be seen whether the election will reflect the real will of the people, but it is certain that this significant moment in Azerbaijani history will serve as an important test of democratic values and will continue to have a lasting impact on the nation's political landscape and its role in regional and global affairs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This might be referring to the cost of a high-speed internet connection, specifically the capacity of one gigabit, which is a measure of data transfer speed. Internet service providers use this metric to advertise their plans and the corresponding prices for them. In this context, it seems that the person is emphasizing the difference in pricing when comparing the costs in their home country and when traveling within the European Union. It is important to note that costs for such services can vary significantly, depending on factors such as the country, provider, quality of the network infrastructure, and competitive landscape. Particularly in the European Union, the Digital Single Market strategy has aimed to reduce the disparities between member states when it comes to digital services and products. Nonetheless, there might still be considerable price differences between countries, reflecting the diverse economic, geographical, and market situations.

Break off a few leaves from an aloe barbadensis miller plant.","completion":"To make aloe vera juice, follow these steps: 1. Preparing the aloe vera leaves: After breaking off a few leaves from the aloe barbadensis miller plant, wash them thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. It is recommended to use mature leaves as they contain more gel. Remove the spiky edges using a sharp knife, being careful not to cut yourself. 2. Extracting the aloe vera gel: Next, lay the leaves flat on a cutting board with the concave side facing upwards. Use the knife to carefully slice off the top layer of the leaf, exposing the clear aloe vera gel underneath. Using a spoon, scoop out the gel and place it in a clean bowl. Repeat this process for each leaf. 3. Blending the gel: Place the extracted aloe vera gel in a blender. If you would like to thin the consistency of the juice, you can add 1 cup (8 oz) of water or any citrus-based juice such as orange juice, lemon juice, or even grapefruit juice. This will not only make the juice thinner but add a nice tang to the taste. 4. Vinegar (optional): If you would like to preserve the aloe vera juice for a longer time, you can add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of white vinegar, which will act as a natural preservative. This step is optional, and you can skip it if you plan to consume the juice immediately or store it in the refrigerator for a short period. 5. Blend the ingredients: Blend the aloe vera gel, water or citrus juice, and vinegar (if using) until it reaches a smooth consistency. You can adjust the thickness of the juice by adding more water or citrus juice. 6. Straining the juice: Although optional, it is advisable to strain the blended aloe vera juice through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove any remaining pulp and ensure the juice is smooth. Collect the strained juice in a clean jar or container. 7. Refrigerate and serve: Store the aloe vera juice in the refrigerator and consume it within a week. Shake the container well before serving, as the juice may settle and separate. Enjoy the refreshing and healthy aloe vera juice, either by itself, mixed with other fruit juices, or added to smoothies. Aloe vera juice has numerous health benefits, including aiding digestion, boosting the immune system, and promoting skin health.

Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries. Of the new planets, which one has more trapped terrestrial radiation? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Millhouse has more trapped terrestrial radiation. Here are the steps to justify the conclusion: 1. Greenhouse gases trap heat, also called terrestrial radiation, that Earth and other planets emit. When a planet has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, it retains more heat, leading to a warmer climate. 2. Jarthrow outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does, while Millhouse outputs twice as many greenhouse gases. 3. Since Millhouse has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, it is expected to trap more terrestrial radiation compared to Jarthrow or Earth.

If I delete WhatsApp, will the messages sent to me while my WhatsApp was deleted be delivered to me when I reinstall it again? How do I know if I'm blocked on WhatsApp? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? pick from the following. I. no. II. yes.","completion":"If you delete WhatsApp, the messages sent to you while your WhatsApp was deleted will be delivered to you when you reinstall it again, provided you restore your chat backup from a previous backup. WhatsApp, by default, backs up your chats and messages on your phone and, in some cases, to cloud storage like Google Drive or iCloud. However, there is a catch: the messages sent to you will only be stored on the WhatsApp server for 30 days. If you reinstall WhatsApp after 30 days, messages sent during the deletion period will be lost and will not be delivered to you. To restore your chat backup when reinstalling WhatsApp, simply follow the prompts during the initial setup process. You will be asked if you want to restore your chats from a backup, and you must agree to do so. This will allow any messages sent to you during the deletion period, within the 30-day window, to be delivered when you reinstall. As for knowing if you're blocked on WhatsApp, there are a few signs you can look for: 1. Last Seen: If you can no longer see the \\"last seen\\" timestamp of the person you suspect has blocked you, it may be an indication that you have been blocked. However, keep in mind that the person could have also disabled this feature in their privacy settings. 2. Profile Picture: If the person's profile picture never changes or you can't see it at all, this might also be a sign that you have been blocked. Again, this is not definitive, as they might have changed their privacy settings or not have a profile picture set. 3. Status updates: Any status updates by the person who you suspect has blocked you will not be visible to you. 4. Message sent ticks: When you send a message to someone, WhatsApp shows a series of checkmarks to indicate the status of the message. One gray checkmark means it's sent, two gray checkmarks mean it's delivered, and two blue checkmarks mean it's read. If you're sending messages to someone you believe has blocked you and you only see one gray checkmark, it could be that they've blocked you. 5. Calling: If you try to call the person on WhatsApp and the call doesn't go through or doesn't connect, this could indicate a block. However, keep in mind that the user could also have connection issues or have their phone turned off. The only definitive way to know if you're blocked on WhatsApp is if you have multiple signs together. Even then, there might be other reasons for these signs appearing.

Plot title: Independence Day Movie plot: On July 2, a giant alien mothership, over 340 miles in diameter (550 km) enters orbit around Earth and deploys several dozen saucer-shaped \\"destroyer\\" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) in width. The destroyers take positions over many of Earth's major cities, including New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), an MIT-graduate working for a cable company in New York City, discovers hidden satellite transmissions which he believes is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack by the aliens. With the help of his ex-wife Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), a White House staffer, David and his father Julius (Judd Hirsch) gain entrance into the Oval Office to warn President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) of the impending attack. The President immediately orders large-scale evacuations of the targeted U.S. cities, but the aliens attack with advanced directed energy weapons before the evacuations could be completed. The President, his young daughter, portions of his staff, Constance and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as a destroyer lays waste to Washington D.C.On July 3, the United States conducts a coordinated counterattack; the movie follows the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, as they participate in an assault on the destroyer that has devastated the city of Los Angeles. Their weapons fail to penetrate the craft's force field, and it responds by releasing scores of smaller \\"attacker\\" ships which are similarly shielded and armed with high-energy torpedoes. One-sided dogfights ensue. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) manages to evade the guns of the attacker ships and lures a single attacker to the Grand Canyon. There, as his jet is about out of fuel and the attacker is about to overtake him, he deploys the landing chute for his jet and it drapes across the alien craft, temporarily disorienting the pilot.

When a construction crew destroys a small wilderness area near the Alden home, Amy finds a nest of goose eggs. Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David (Terry Kinney) knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her fatherâs old barn to incubate. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local game warden Glen Seifert (Jeremy Ratchford) on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have imprinted on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that all domestic geese must have their wings pinioned (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them. Thomas decides to use an ultralight aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry (Holter Graham), Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a bird sanctuary in North Carolina, and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.

We can imagine the following scenario unfolding in further detail: As the house lights dim and a hush falls over the audience, the curtains begin to draw back, revealing a beautifully designed set. Intricate and delicate, the set provides a perfect backdrop for the upcoming ballet performance. The ballerinas, poised on stage, stand close together in the starting positions of the choreography, awaiting the first notes of the orchestra to start playing. In this moment, the tension in the air is palpable. The audience members lean forward in anticipation, eager to witness the grace and artistry that ballet is known for. Meanwhile, the ballerinas, with dancers' nerves held in check, are keenly focused on delivering a flawless and powerful performance. As the music commences, the dancers' movements synchronize perfectly with the melodious notes. The initial choreography showcases the four ballerinas as if they were one unified entity, effortlessly gliding across the stage as they perform intricate movements and delicate turns. With their light and airy steps, they seem to defy gravity – every jump and lift accentuating their impressive physical prowess and grace. The story weaved into the ballet unfolds as the ballerinas travel through diverse emotions and challenges. The choreographer has designed individual solo performances to highlight each dancer's unique talents. Each solo adds another layer to the narrative, drawing the audience deeper into the world they are creating with every step, turn, and jump. In concert with the captivating storyline, the dancers utilize their technical skill to bring the sentiment and emotional depth of the music to life. Captivating the audience, they display the fluidity, elegance, and high degree of discipline that has been honed through years of intense and dedicated practice. As the performance builds toward its climax, the four ballerinas come together once again in perfect harmony, visibly connected by their shared passion and commitment to their art form. Their movements become even more dynamic – the leaps higher, the turns faster, and the lifts seemingly more gravity-defying. The audience cannot help but be wholly absorbed by the visually and emotionally stunning display on stage. As the music reaches its crescendo and the dancers execute their final movements, the auditorium resonates with a feeling of awe and admiration. The ballerinas, panting and flush with the exertion of their performance, freeze in a final tableau, gracefully capturing the essence of the story in a single, breathtaking moment. The spell that the ballet has cast on the audience gently breaks, and as the music fades, the auditorium bursts into rapturous applause."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

We asked about one of the deserts and she had to go in the back to ask. As it turns out it did not matter what the answer was, the desert was not available. The menu selection was on the small side which is not a bad thing if the quality is outstanding. Sadly, outstanding is not a word to describe any portion of our lunch. My gf and I split a few items on the menu. We had the Taboule Salad, Lentil Soup and a side of fries with feta cheese and a vinegar sauce. The lentil soup was almost passable, but it had a certain blandness. When the taboule was brought to the table the chef, maybe owner, gave a disclaimer \\"hope you like it really sour\\".

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"Which is not a species of bird: passerine, kiwi, or chick?\\", we need to identify the terms mentioned in the text and determine if they are species of birds or not. Let's analyze the text step by step: 1. Incubation of eggs is discussed in general to provide information and context. 2. In monogamous and polygamous species, the process of incubation is described, but no specific bird species are mentioned here. 3. Brood patches are mentioned, which are a characteristic of incubating birds, but again, no specific species are identified. 4. Albatrosses are mentioned as an example of a bird that experiences weight loss during incubation, which indicates that albatrosses are bird species. However, they are not in the list of options (passerine, kiwi, or chick), so we continue our search. 5. Megapodes are mentioned, although also not among the options, we are looking for. 6. Finally, we reach the sentence that says, \\"Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\" In this sentence, passerines and kiwis are both mentioned as bird species since they have defined incubation periods.

However, to answer the question about which two empires fought to control Afghanistan, it is crucial to specify the time period in question.

Nonetheless, two of the most prominent empires that fought to control the region were the British and Russian Empires during the 19th and early 20th centuries, a period known as the \\"Great Game.\\" The \\"Great Game\\" was a political struggle between the British and Russian empires, primarily resulting from their desire to expand their territories and maintain influence in Central Asia. Afghanistan was located between these two empires, with British India to the south and the Russian Empire to the north. During this time, a series of Anglo-Afghan Wars took place, with Britain attempting to maintain control and influence in Afghanistan while keeping the Russians from advancing into the area. The first Anglo-Afghan War was from 1839 to 1842, followed by the second war from 1878 to 1880, and the third war in 1919. In these wars, the British aimed to install a more compliant leadership in Afghanistan to prevent Russian influence and expansion. Conversely, the Russians sought to fortify their position in Central Asia. Afghanistan was a highly prized territory as it served as a gateway between the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Additionally, Afghanistan's natural resources and geographical position made it an important juncture for trade and communication. Therefore, both empires fought fiercely for control over this strategic territory. In conclusion, the British and Russian Empires were involved in a bitter struggle to control Afghanistan during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although various empires have historically risen and fallen in the region, the two empires that most notably fought for control during this specific period were the British Empire and the Russian Empire amid the \\"Great Game.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Why should I become an IAS officer? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"First, I will provide the curriculum for IAS officers for their training. Step 1: Conduct research on the structure of the IAS training curriculum. Step 2: Gather information on various subjects and modules that are covered during the training. Step 3: Organize the information in a clear and concise manner so that it is easily understandable. The curriculum for IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer training is divided into three broad stages: Foundation Course, Phase-I (Professional Course), and Phase-II (Bharat Darshan & District Training). The training usually takes place at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie, India. 1. Foundation Course: This is a common course for all the civil services trainees. It covers subjects like Public Administration, Indian Polity, Indian Economy, Indian History, Geography, Law, Management, and Science & Technology. 2. Phase-I (Professional Course): This 26-week course is specific to IAS officers. It includes modules on Constitution & Governance, Public Administration, General Management, Economic Administration, Law & Order Administration, Development Administration, and Financial Administration. 3. Phase-II (Bharat Darshan and District Training): This consists of a series of attachments with various organizations, including a 4-week Central attachment with the Government of India in Delhi, a 45-week District attachment on the ground, and a 2-week Foreign attachment in a foreign country. Next, I will answer the second question: \\"Why should I become an IAS officer?\\" Step 1: Understand the roles and responsibilities of an IAS officer. Step 2: List the benefits of being an IAS officer both professionally and personally. Step 3: Present reasons for why someone might consider becoming an IAS officer. Some reasons to become an IAS officer are: 1. Serving the Nation: IAS officers work to implement the policies and decisions made by the government to improve the lives of citizens. 2. Decision-Making Power: Being an IAS officer comes with authority and decision-making power that can impact the lives of millions. 3. Diverse Career Opportunities: IAS officers deal with a variety of tasks such as policy formulation, implementation, disaster management, and social welfare. 4. Job Security and Stability: IAS officers enjoy job security and stability throughout their careers with multiple opportunities for promotion and professional growth. 5. Prestige and Respect: IAS officers are highly respected in society due to their contributions to the nation's development. Finally, I will address the third question: \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about the training curriculum for IAS officers, while the second question is about the reasons why someone would consider becoming an IAS officer.

The reason behind this trouble is the ongoing argument in higher education between lecturers and employers over pay.The Association of University Teachers(AUT)are currently taking industrial action because of the fact that lecturers have been underpaid for years.Vice-presidents of the universities,who enjoy six-figure salaries,are not making any noises to suggest that this will change in the near future. The National Union of Students(NUS) ly believes that our lecturers should be better paid,and that the promises made to them during the top-up fees debate about extra income must be kept. It's shameful that 1ecturers have had to take industrial action to achieve better pay and conditions while vice-presidents'own salaries have risen 25%over the past three years.But the students who are suffering as a result of the argument must be put first.We do not agree with the attitude taken by the AUT,which is refusing to set exams.We admit that the decision to take this course of action was democratically reached.However,it is having the biggest effect on our members at this moment in time and we will continue to let the AUT know the results of this.

In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island.

UPDATED:. 20:05 EST, 10 May 2013. Repeat: Tony Martin, who killed an intruder in 1999, has been burgled again and he chased the intruder off his farm. A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal. Tony Martin, 67, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on Thursday, but felt he had to let him go. The pensioner said he wished he had tried to stop him, but was afraid to defend his property after being locked up in 2000. Mr Martin, who no longer holds a gun licence, said he realised ‘it would be me in trouble’. He added: ‘I couldn’t face going through all that again.’ The farmer fired three shots in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home. He killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29. Mr Martin was initially jailed for nine years after being convicted of murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and he was released after three years. The case sparked fierce debate over whether homeowners should be given greater legal protection to defend their property. Two days ago, Mr Martin caught a man breaking into a barn on his 14-acre property, but felt powerless to stop him. He said he had already been burgled ‘two or three times’ since he was released from jail. He said: ‘I could easily have made it, and fought him for what he’d stolen, but then it quickly flashed through my mind that it would be me in trouble, not him. ‘There were weapons inside the shed so, if I had wanted to fight him off, I could have. I wished I had but, after everything I’ve been through in the past, I just couldn’t face all that hassle again. ‘I haven’t changed my views about what happened in 1999, but the whole experience has made me lose faith in the system and I didn’t want to be made out as the criminal again.’ Mr Martin, who never moved back into the farmhouse where both burglaries took place, was checking his outbuildings when he came across the intruder. He claimed the man, in his 20s, had a £90 tractor battery and a new sink unit in his arms. Incident: This is farmer Tony Martin's property, who has again been targeted by burglars again. These out buildings were allegedly where the thief was seen. Attempt: The thief allegedly tried to steal a tractor battery before being chased away by Mr Martin. As the burglar fled – dropping the stolen items – Mr Martin said he shouted: ‘Come back again and I’ll sort you my way.’ Yesterday he vowed not to let the burglar get away for a second time. He said: ‘He ran away but I’m convinced he’ll be back in my barn and then he’ll wish he wasn’t.’ He said little had changed to protect homeowners since his imprisonment, saying: ‘I don’t think we’re any safer than we were then. ‘I still feel vulnerable and am unable to properly protect myself.’ Scene: The garden and overgrown Bleak House, where Tony Martin shot three times at two burglars and killed one in 1999. In October last year, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said householders who react with ‘proportionate’ force when confronted by burglars would receive more legal protection. Last month, a law finally came into force to give householders the right to ‘bash a burglar’, but with a string of exemptions attached. For example, people will not be protected if they chase the burglar outside – and any fight must take place indoors. Yesterday, Mr Martin was said to be so ‘distressed’ by the attempted theft that he sought hospital treatment. He asked officers at Wisbech Police. Station, in Cambridgeshire, to ‘detain’ him for his own protection,. claiming he was suffering from ‘delayed shock’. Mr Martin, who has suffered from. depression in recent years, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in. King’s Lynn, Norfolk, where he was assessed by doctors. Intruders: 16 year old Fred Barras was shot dead by Mr Martin while Brendan Fearon escaped. Later he said: ‘I am here for my own sanity and the safety of burglars. I can’t stand burglars. I think they are a filthy lot.’ Mr Martin said he had suffered similar health issues in May 1999, when he had reported a string of burglaries on his farm. He said police suggested at the time. that the break-ins, which took place two months before he shot Barras,. might be a ‘figment of his imagination’. A spokesman for Norfolk Police said: ‘Inquiries are on-going.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Movie title: Patayin Sa Sindak Si Barbara Context: Being the loving older sister, Barbara (Lorna Tolentino) has always been overly indulgent of her little sister Ruth's every whim. Years later, Barbara meets and instantly falls in love with Nick (Tonton Gutierrez), who is mutually smitten with her. But the spoiled Ruth (Dawn Zulueta) confesses to her older sister that she too is in love with Nick and threatens to kill herself if he does not marry her. So with a heavy heart, Barbara once again passively accommodates Ruth's demands and convinces Nick to court her younger sister instead. In a twisted act of devotion, Nick reluctantly agrees to marry Ruth, to prove his love for Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara then decides to start a new life abroad, to give Nick a chance to truly fall in love with Ruth and for Barbara to get over her feelings for him. Her past comes back to haunt her (in more ways than one) when Barbara receives news that her younger sister has killed herself and was witnessed by Ruth's only daughter Karen (Antoinette Taus). Barbara immediately returns to the Philippines to mourn her sister and comfort her unstable niece. But strange events happen upon Barbara's return and she learns the reason surrounding Ruth's mysterious death. Throughout their marriage, Ruth felt that Nick never really loved her, but instead still harboured feelings for her sister. In a state of paranoid delusion, she suspects that Nick was having an affair and used his business trips to the United States as an excuse to rendezvous with Barbara. In a jealous rage, she commits suicide and haunts the household and everyone she deemed who have wronged her. It was later revealed that ever since Barbara left her for the US, she indulged herself of everything that can ease her helplessness which includes witchcraft and spiritual medium sessions.

Summarize this article: The series, which became a national talking point when it began in 2000, has been resurrected by Channel 5. In April it was announced that the broadcaster had signed a two-year deal with the show's creators Endemol. Gaining notoriety for Nasty Nick's deceit in the first series, sexual encounters among housemates and romances which were later played out in glossy magazines, the programme was initially a huge hit for Channel 4. But a drop in ratings in recent years led Channel 4's director of television Kevin Lygo to announce in 2009 that the show \\"had reached a natural end point\\". 'Positive and interesting' So why is Channel 5 investing so much time and effort in reviving the format? Bosses are hopeful the programme's reincarnation will attract new audiences to the network. Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has reportedly had a hands-on role in Big Brother's relaunch In pictures: Big Brother house Big Brother through the years \\"This will allow us to connect to a younger audience, and very importantly, we will continue to serve the viewers who love us,\\" says Jeff Ford, Channel 5's director of programmes. \\"But we're not going to tailor it for a Channel 5 audience because we want all audiences who used to love the show.\\" Speaking at the series launch party in Elstree, where the Big Brother house has been refurbished, he promises fans that the celebrity spin-off of the new series will include only the \\"the biggest, most colourful and interesting names around\\". He says they are focusing on making the programme \\"fun, positive and interesting\\", which reflects the brand values of the channel. 'Ratings gods' Tim Hincks, chief executive of Endemol, says the regular version of the series, which begins immediately after the three-week celebrity series, is going to be \\"entertaining, funny, glamorous and occasionally sexy\\". According to reports, Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has been closely involved in the preparation for the new show, even selecting contestants himself. The media mogul, who also owns the Daily Star, the Daily Express and OK! magazine, has high hopes for Big Brother, telling the Media Guardian he wants to generate huge ratings of at least 20 million viewers. But how can a show that ran for 10 years and was given a thorough send-off be successfully resurrected? Former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling, who is replacing presenter Davina McCall in the new version, predicts it will be a success because it is \\"missing from people's TV screens\\". The 33-year-old, who won the second series in 2001 and Ultimate Big Brother last year, adds: \\"Let's be honest, Endemol and Channel Five are not spending Â£220m for no good reason. \\"Think about it, Channel 5 is right next to Channel 4 and if people are real fans, they'll watch it regardless of what channel it's on.\\" But some fans are uncertain. Dominic Norwell, 31, from Whitstable in Kent, has watched every series since its inception. By Torin DouglasMedia correspondent, BBC News Can Channel 5 make Big Brother a national talking point again? That depends on whether it has persuaded enough high-profile names to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, the launch pad for the series on its new channel. But more importantly, it depends on coverage in magazines and tabloid newspapers not owned by Richard Desmond. He bought Channel 5 as a way of extending the \\"celebrity\\" focus of his print media empire into TV. Desmond's titles - OK! magazine, the Daily Express, the Daily Star and their Sunday versions - can be relied on to promote Big Brother. So can Channel 5's OK TV! programme, which is relocating to the Big Brother house. The Daily Star proclaims it's the Official Big Brother paper with cover stories and double-page spreads on which celebrities are tipped to be in or out. But the Sun and the Daily Mirror - which have many more readers - are more interested in ITV's X Factor, \\"counting down\\" to its first show on Saturday. \\"The closure they gave the last series on Channel 4 was too final,\\" he says. \\"To bring it back on a smaller channel is just not going to work. If there's nothing else on, people might migrate over to and flick it on, but it won't be like Channel 4's show where people would plan their Friday nights round the eviction.\\" Media analyst Toby Syfret from Enders Analysis says the success of the programme is \\"immensely important\\" to Channel 5. \\"It's the big buy they have made since last year, there's a lot of money riding on it. \\"There are figures all over the place about what it is worth and with that sort of money they are intending on making a big splash.\\" He says the format - which was broadcast in 87 countries last year - is \\"very important property\\" and could \\"hurt\\" Channel 4 in terms of sales and viewing figures. \\"If you look at the audience trends of Big Brother over the years it's gone down and it is less fashionable for the young than it was some years ago, but it still delivered a very good audience profile. \\"If it's successful it will do the [Channel 5] brand nothing but good.\\" Popular formula Mr Ford is equally confident the show will be a big hit, quoting Kevin Costner's character from the 1989 film Field Of Dreams. \\"If you build it they will come. So we've built it, so obviously because we've built it they're going to come, aren't they? \\"It's in the hands of the ratings gods and I pray to them every night and that's all I can do,\\" he laughs. The ratings formula was not proven when Australian soap Neighbours moved from BBC One to Channel 5 in 2008. The show ended on a Friday and by the following Monday had lost 300,000 viewers. Channel 5's attempt at producing reality TV in the past has not been as successful as its terrestrial counterparts. In 2004 the network launched Back to Reality, which featured stars from other reality shows. The Farm made its debut in the same year, its most memorable moment being Rebecca Loos stimulating a pig for breeding purposes. Neither show was hugely popular, which might explain why producers have decided not to tamper with the successful Big Brother formula. \\"If you were to change the format too much, it wouldn't be Big Brother anymore,\\" says Gavin Henderson, the programme's creative director. He previously worked on the third series of the show, which introduced the late Jade Goody to our screens. A few physical changes will be introduced, he says, which will include a slightly bigger garden and one bedroom instead of two in the Big Brother compound. He adds that there will also be a new approach to editing, which means viewers \\"won't necessarily have to sit and watch it every single day for three months\\". Live streaming of content all day every day has also been replaced with the emphasis now being on following updates on social network sites Twitter and Facebook. No doubt there will be blanket coverage of the show across all of Desmond's publications. But whether that will be enough remains to be seen as channel bosses nervously await the first set of viewing figures on Friday. Celebrity Big Brother begins on Channel 5 on Thursday 18 August at 2100 BST. Summary:","completion":"Channel 5 has revived the popular reality TV series Big Brother, after it had initially come to an end in 2009 due to declining ratings.

However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas.

Oil, Banks Drag Dow Down 1.1% Stocks declined Monday on renewed concerns that some big banks may have issues repaying federal bailout funds and as a slide in oil prices weighed on both energy and materials firms. After rallying about 100 points to start off Monday's session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended lower by 104.22 points, or 1.1%, at 9867.96. A slide in oil prices began just before the stock market's turn into the red, with crude futures settling down 1.82 at 78.68 a barrel. Within the Dow, 27 of its 30 components fell, including energy giants Chevronand Exxon Mobil. As for financials, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that Bank of America's attempt to repay federal bailout funds and escape the government's grasp has been snagged by a disagreement over how much additional capital the bank must raise to satisfy regulators, according to people familiar with the situation. Bank of America slid 5.1%, the biggest decliner on the Dow. Along with the banking and oil concerns, traders cited a flood of other factors depressing stocks, including a gain for the dollar and conflicting reports on whether Congress will extend the tax credit for first-time home buyers. More broadly, traders said the market's decline on Monday reflected increasing skepticism about a seven-month rally in stocks that pushed the Dow to its highest point of the year late last week. \\"The action today is very impulsive and that has added a little more credence to the fear there could be a larger correction in equity markets coming,\\" said Christian Bendixen, director of technical research for Bay Crest Partners. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 12.65, or 1.2%, to 1066.95, weighed down by its materials and financial sectors, which each declined 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 12.62 points, or 0.6%, to 2141.85. The decline in oil and other commodities prices restarted a round of concern about global demand in the coming months, a fear that percolated last week as two railroad giants posted weak quarterly reports and transportation stocks fell precipitously. Investors had come into the week somewhat on edge with the Dow up nearly 3% for the month, especially given stocks were up even more in September before a slide in the month's final week. Moreover, any strength for the dollar has been a selling sign for stock traders. After some slight morning gains, the dollar was rallying lately against both the euro and the yen. \\"This gain in the dollar has been building for a couple days,\\" said Adam Boyton, a foreign exchange strategist with Deutsche Bank. As for stocks, Mr. Boyton said \\"people just aren't going to get long the market into the end of the month right now.\\" Treasurys fell, with the two-year note sliding 1/32 to yield 1.029%, and the 10-year note falling 21/32 at 3.567%. The indirect bid for Treasury's reopened five-year TIPS was above average, but market participants were expecting a higher indirect bid since it was the first five-year TIPS sale since Treasury changed auction-bidder rules in June.

Poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, prosaic ostensible meaning. Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse;[a] prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem. Prior to the nineteenth century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is \\"any kind of subject consisting of Rythm or Verses\\". Possibly as a result of Aristotle's influence (his Poetics), \\"poetry\\" before the nineteenth century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What will Clinton do if she is elected president? What will Trump do if elected president? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions you have posed are not the same, as they pertain to the potential actions of two different individuals, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, if they were elected president. Although both questions address what each candidate would do if elected, the expected actions and policies of these two candidates are distinct due to their differing political affiliations and ideologies. Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of what each candidate might have done if they were elected president. Hillary Clinton: As a former Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, and First Lady, Hillary Clinton has a long history in public service and has laid out several policy proposals during her presidential campaign in 2016. If Hillary Clinton were elected president, we could expect the following actions: 1. Healthcare: Clinton would likely aim to defend and expand the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, with a focus on lowering costs and expanding coverage. She has also advocated for a public insurance option, prescription drug affordability, as well as women's health and reproductive rights. 2. Climate change and clean energy: Clinton has expressed commitment to combating climate change and promoting clean energy development. She would probably support policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy infrastructure, and transitioning away from fossil fuels. 3. Economic policies: Clinton proposed raising the federal minimum wage, investing in infrastructure projects to create jobs, and implementing policies to reduce income inequality. Moreover, she would likely push for equal pay for women and measures to support working families, such as affordable child care and paid family leave. 4. Education: Clinton would likely advocate for universal pre-kindergarten education, making college more affordable through debt-free tuition programs for middle-class families, and supporting student loan refinancing options. 5. Immigration: Clinton's stance on immigration includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, defending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and investing in border security. 6. Foreign policy: Clinton would likely continue with existing foreign policy approaches, maintaining the United States' commitment to NATO, supporting Israel, addressing terrorism, and promoting diplomacy over military intervention when possible. Donald Trump: Donald Trump, a businessman turned politician, served as the 45th president of the United States from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. As observed during his term in office, if elected president again, Trump's actions might include the following: 1. Healthcare: Trump would continue to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, advocating for a free-market healthcare system and pushing for policies like allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines. 2. Climate change and clean energy: Trump has expressed skepticism towards climate change and would likely not make it a priority. He could continue to roll back environmental regulations, promote the use of fossil fuels, and withdraw from international agreements on climate change, such as the Paris Agreement. 3. Economic policies: Trump would emphasize tax cuts, particularly for corporations and the wealthy, in an attempt to stimulate economic growth. He might continue to pursue protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from trade agreements, and potentially imposing tariffs on imports. 4. Education: Trump would probably advocate for school choice, promoting policies that allow families to use public funds to send their children to private or charter schools, and possibly reducing the federal government's role in education. 5. Immigration: Trump would likely continue his hardline stance on immigration, expanding and fortifying the border wall between the United States and Mexico, further restricting legal immigration, and tightening asylum policies. 6. Foreign policy: Trump's foreign policy has been characterized by an \\"America First\\" approach. He might continue to question the United States' involvement in international alliances, seek to negotiate new trade agreements, and pursue a more isolationist foreign policy stance. In conclusion, both questions you asked are not the same but rather focus on the potential actions of two different presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Each candidate would pursue different policies and approaches in handling various issues, including healthcare, climate change, economic development, education, immigration, and foreign policy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the fact that: In erosion, the higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it will reach base level and the more cutting it has to do. Answer the question: A stream going across a low plain will have to do much or little cutting? The answer is:","completion":"A stream going across a low plain will have to do little cutting. This is because, in erosion, the gradient or steepness of the land plays a significant role in determining the rate at which a stream will erode its bed and banks. As the elevation decreases, the gradient of the stream also decreases, leading to a reduced flow velocity, which in turn reduces the erosive force of the stream. When a stream flows through a low plain, it is closer to its base level, which is the lowest point to which a stream can erode its bed. As a result, the stream has relatively less energy and therefore less erosive potential, so it requires less cutting of its bed and banks. In addition, the lower gradient of the land in a low plain tends to result in less turbulent flow, further reducing the stream's ability to downcut or erode laterally. In summary, a stream going across a low plain will have to do little cutting because of the reduced gradient, proximity to its base level, and more gentle, less turbulent flow."},{"prompt":"Remy showed everyone how to bake a delicious cake in the oven.

This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with \\"relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,\\" and a total admixture estimate \\"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.\\" This supported the finding that \\"Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\\" \\"Past research found that 50–80 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East,\\" Richards said.","completion":"To extract the answer to the question, I will follow these steps: 1.

In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Islay is the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Known as \\"The Queen of the Hebrides\\", it lies in Argyll just south west of Jura and around north of the Irish coast. The island's capital is Bowmore where the distinctive round Kilarrow Parish Church and a distillery are located. Port Ellen is the main port. - Buckwheat (\\"Fagopyrum esculentum\\") is a plant cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a cover crop. To distinguish it from a related species, \\"Fagopyrum tataricum\\", it is also known as Japanese buckwheat and silverhull buckwheat. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago.

Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as \\"Coleus\\". Others are grown for seed, such as \\"Salvia hispanica\\" (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as \\"Plectranthus edulis\\", \\"Plectranthus esculentus\\", \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", and \\"Stachys affinis\\" (Chinese artichoke). - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the local government council for \\"Na h-Eileanan Siar\\" council area of Scotland, comprising the Outer Hebrides. - The Polygonaceae are a family of flowering plants known informally as the knotweed family or smartweedbuckwheat family in the United States. The name is based on the genus \\"Polygonum\\", and was first used by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his book, \\"Genera Plantarum\\". The name refers to the many swollen nodes the stems of some species have. It is derived from Greek; \\"poly\\" means many and \\"goni\\" means knee or joint. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

In the 2011 census it had a usually resident population of 1,303, with a sizable percentage of Roman Catholics. It forms part of the area administered by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar or the Western Isles Council. - Eriskay, from the Old Norse for \\"Eric's Isle\\", is an island and community council area of the Outer Hebrides in northern Scotland. It lies between South Uist and Barra and is connected to South Uist by a causeway which was opened in 2001. In the same year Eriskay became the ferry terminal for travelling between South Uist and Barra. The Caledonian MacBrayne vehicular ferry travels between Ceann a' Ghàraidh in Eriskay and Ardmore in Barra. The crossing takes around 40 minutes. - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland.

It is grown as a grain crop primarily for its edible seeds. It is a pseudocereal rather than a true cereal, as it is not a grass. Quinoa is closely related to species such as beetroot and spinach and amaranth, another pseudocereal (which it closely resembles). After harvest, the seeds are processed to remove the coating containing the bitter-tasting saponins. Generally, the seeds are cooked the same way as rice and can be used in a wide range of dishes. The leaves, meanwhile, are sometimes eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth, but commercial availability of quinoa greens is limited. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - A LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that consists of sending a special poison spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to lock up. The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2. - Kirkwall is the largest town and capital of the Orkney Islands of Scotland. The town is first mentioned in \\"Orkneyinga saga\\" in the year 1046 when it is recorded as the residence of Rögnvald Brusason the Earl of Orkney, who was killed by his uncle Thorfinn the Mighty. In 1486, King James III of Scotland elevated Kirkwall to the status of a royal burgh; modern roadsigns still indicate \\"The City and Royal Burgh of Kirkwall\\". - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in the human diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut \\"meat\\" and coconut \\"water\\", and corn. Some plants, such as orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds. - Health food is food considered beneficial to health in ways that go beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition. No human being being the same as any other, different dietary practices can be considered healthy by different people. - Bere , pronounced \`\` bear , '' is a six - row barley currently cultivated mainly on 5 - 15 hectares of land in Orkney , Scotland . It is also grown on Shetland , Caithness and on a very small scale by a few crofters on some of the Western Isles , i.e. North Uist , Benbecula , South Uist , Islay and Barra . It is probably Britain 's oldest cereal in continuous commercial cultivation . Bere is a landrace adapted to growing on soils of a low pH and to a short growing season with long hours of daylight , as found in the high latitudes of northern Scotland . It is sown in the spring and harvested in the summer . Because of its very rapid growth rate it is sown late but is often the first crop to be harvested . It is known locally as \`\` the 90 - day barley . '' - Caithness (, ; Old Norse: \\"Katanes\\") is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland. - South Uist is an island of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. In the 2011 census it had a usually resident population of 1,754, a fall of 64 since 2001. There is a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest, including the only location in Great Britain where prehistoric mummies have been found. The population is about 90% Roman Catholic. The island, in common with the rest of the Hebrides, is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland. In 2006 South Uist, and neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay were involved in Scotland's biggest community land buyout to date. In the north west there is a missile testing range. Its inhabitants are known in Gaelic as \\"\\"Deasaich\\"\\" (Southerners). - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Review: read my lips Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"The movie review sentence \\"read my lips\\" can be interpreted in various ways as it lacks enough context to clearly determine whether it carries a positive or negative connotation. The phrase \\"read my lips\\" is typically used to emphasize a statement or request that follows, indicating that the speaker is serious about what they are saying. However, in this brief sentence, there is no direct reference to any movie or specific aspect of a movie. If we imagine the sentence as part of a larger review, we can explore both positive and negative interpretations. Positive interpretation: This could be a positive statement if it's followed by a compliment or recommendation. For example: \\"Read my lips – this movie's acting is phenomenal, and the cinematography is breathtaking. I highly recommend watching it!\\" In this context, the phrase is used to draw the reader's attention and emphasize the positive aspects of the movie, making it a positive statement. Negative interpretation: On the other hand, it could also be negative if followed by a critique or warning. For example: \\"Read my lips – this movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is poorly structured, and the characters are underdeveloped.\\" Here, the phrase is employed to stress the negative attributes of the movie, and the statement is decidedly negative. Given the ambiguity of the sentence \\"read my lips\\" as a stand-alone statement, it is impossible to definitively categorize the sentence as either wholly positive or negative. Without further context, a conclusive judgment cannot be made."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Answer the question...who painted la primavera a painting of the roman goddess flora??","completion":"La Primavera, a painting depicting the Roman goddess Flora, is a masterpiece by the Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. Born Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi in 1445, Sandro Botticelli belonged to the Florentine School during the Early Renaissance period under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici. He produced several prominent art pieces in his lifetime, with 'La Primavera' being one of his most famous works. The painting, which is also known as the Allegory of Spring, was created around 1477-1482 and measures approximately 202 x 314 cm. It is currently housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. In the painting, Botticelli used tempera paints on a wood panel, a common practice of the time. His style was typified by linear grace, flowing lines, and a superb use of color and contrasts. La Primavera features nine figures, including the Roman goddess Flora, arranged on a grassy meadow adorned with a vibrant variety of flowers. The primary characters in the artwork are mythological figures from Roman and Greek mythology. From left to right, they are Mercury, the messenger of the gods; the Three Graces, who embody beauty, charm, and grace; Venus, the goddess of love; Flora, the goddess of flowers and spring; Chloris, the nymph whom Zephyrus, the god of the West Wind, is pursuing; and finally, Zephyrus himself. One of the most striking elements of the painting is the marvelous depiction of the garlanded figure of Flora. She is adorned with flowers that many believe to be botanically accurate, demonstrating Botticelli's attention to detail and ability to expertly capture the beauty of the natural world. Flora is shown scattering flowers and symbolizes the renewal of life as well as the abundance and fertility that comes with springtime. The painting has attracted significant scholarly attention, and various interpretations of its allegorical meaning have been proposed. Some believe that La Primavera is a representation of Neoplatonic love, while others argue that it highlights the theme of marriage and was commissioned on the occasion of a wedding. There are still more interpretations that revolve around the humanist ideals pervading Renaissance Florence. In summary, La Primavera, featuring the Roman goddess Flora, is a remarkable painting that was created by the Early Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. Combining mythological themes and figures, skillful use of color, and an evident appreciation of beauty and renewal, this artwork has earned its place as an iconic piece of the Italian Renaissance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Not A Hack: U.S. Office Of Government Ethics Tweets At Trump Enlarge this image U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR The federal ethics watchdog isn't the kind of agency that typically airs its positions on Twitter — let alone in a snarky tone, with exclamation points. But it's been an all-around weird day at the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. It started Wednesday morning, when President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to address concerns about his ability to lead the U.S. government while also holding massive business interests around the world. \\"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\\" Trump tweeted, adding that \\"legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations\\" and that he will be leaving his \\"great business in total.\\" What exactly that means remains unclear. But the verified Twitter account of the typically decorous federal ethics office chimed in with statements that appeared to goad Trump about divesting his businesses — something he hasn't specifically promised to do. \\"Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!\\" the agency tweeted, mimicking Trump's own tweeting style. And: \\"OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!\\" And then things kept getting weirder. All of the tweets disappeared. Twitter erupted in confusion. Observers were suggesting this was a hack or the work of a rogue employee, as The Washington Post posited: \\"Maybe the OGE has inadvertently leaked that Trump intends to sell off his assets, a dramatic move that the president-elect may have intended to save for his 'major news conference' Dec. 15. Maybe the tweets are a hacker's social-media joke. Or maybe an OGE official went rogue with the agency's social-media accounts, as a way to sarcastically poke at Trump or, having misread the news, cheer him on.\\" But then, some hours later, the tweets returned — re-posted all over again, sending a new wave of confusion. U.S. Office of Government Ethics/Screenshot by NPR An OGE spokesman, Seth Jaffe, who is the chief of the agency's ethics law and policy branch, emailed a statement to NPR: \\"Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect's twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest. OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don't know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.\\" The statement suggested that the tweets have been deliberate all along. And, in fact, the OGE later confirmed to NPR that this was not a hack. A few things remained a mystery, among them: Did the OGE know something about Trump's plans that he hasn't made public? As NPR's Scott Detrow has reported: \\"Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised to turn the Trump Organization over to three of his children. But Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump all remain close political advisers and members of his transition team, so it's hard to see how the Trump Organization and the Trump administration would remain separate, if that remains the case.\\" Almost two hours after the first statement, the OGE issued another one: \\"The tweets that OGE posted today were responding only to the public statement that the President-elect made on his Twitter feed about his plans regarding conflicts of interest. OGE's tweets were not based on any information about the President-elect's plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed. OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\\" The agency's officials still haven't answered why the tweets — if they were deliberate — initially were deleted. And more fundamentally, why did the usually straitlaced OGE decide to break character and publicly vocalize its opinion? Perhaps it's part of a new, Trump-inspired era of governing and social media. Big league! ||||| Historically, presidential candidates have pledged to put their assets into a blind trust if they were to win the White House. | AP Photo Obama ethics office congratulates Trump in bizarre mini-tweetstorm The federal Office of Government Ethics offered its congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump Wednesday afternoon for his announcement that he will be ceding control of his business empire as president. The president-elect made the announcement Wednesday morning on Twitter, telling his followers, “I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Story Continued Below After cryptically posting and then deleting tweets directed at Trump earlier in the day, the OGE sent a flurry of posts praising the president-elect for his “divestiture” from his business holdings. But Trump did not say anything about divesting in his Tuesday morning announcement, and previously pledged only to give control of his companies to his three eldest children, not to remove his financial interests in them. “.@realDonaldTrump We can't repeat enough how good this total divestiture will be,” the OGE posted to its verified Twitter account, launching the string of tweets. “.@realDonaldTrump Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America!” In some posts, the OGE seemed to mimic Trump’s staccato style on Twitter, writing “.@realDonaldTrump OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!” and “.@realDonaldTrump Bravo! Only way to resolve these conflicts of interest is to divest . Good call!” Other posts published by OGE say that the office has had contact with Trump’s lawyers and that it had informed them that “divestiture is the way to resolve these conflicts.” In another post, the OGE wrote: “[W]e told your counsel we'd sing your praises if you divested, we meant it.” Trump’s legal team did not immediately respond to questions about any communication it has had with the OGE. Historically, presidential candidates have pledged to put their assets into a blind trust if they were to win the White House, a threshold Trump would not meet by simply handing over control of his businesses to his children. Since his surprise victory on Election Day, the Trump children who would take control of his companies have taken on leadership roles on his transition team and have sat in on phone calls and meetings with world leaders. In a statement released after the posts went public on the OGE’s Twitter account, a spokesman clarified that the office in fact remains unaware of the details of Trump’s plans but nonetheless “applauds” his intentions. It urged him to divest from his business empire, differentiating from the Twitter posts, which suggested Trump has already made such a decision. “Like everyone else, we were excited this morning to read the President-elect’s twitter feed indicating that he wants to be free of conflicts of interest,” OGE spokesman Seth Jaffe said. “OGE applauds that goal, which is consistent with an opinion OGE issued in 1983. Divestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not. We don’t know the details of their plan, but we are willing and eager to help them with it.” Jaffe later clarified that OGE's tweets were responding only to Trump's public comments, \\"not based on any information about the President-elect’s plans beyond what was shared on his Twitter feed.\\" He added: \\"OGE is non-partisan and does not endorse any individual.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The U.S. Office of Government Ethics, a federal agency, posted some tweets that looked like they were making fun of Donald Trump about his business interests. People thought maybe someone had hacked their Twitter account or that an employee was playing a joke. However, the agency said they were not hacked and they were just excited to see that Trump wants to avoid conflicts of interest with his businesses. They were trying to encourage him to sell his businesses to truly avoid any problems, but it is still not clear what Trump plans to do."},{"prompt":"Given the below context: The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was established in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project... Guess a valid title for it!

While it is true that the statement could potentially be from a student as well, given the options provided, choice iii (the narrator is a teacher) is the most reasonable option. Choice ii (the narrator is a student) is less probable as such a statement regarding the students' activities sounds more like an authoritative perspective.

Summarize this article: White, French, or sourdough sandwich bread will work great for this, but you can also use other types as well, such as wheat. Do not use baguette for this. For a tasty twist, use mayonnaise instead of butter. Place one of the bread slices, buttered-side-down on the cutting board. Layer the ham and cheese on top, then press the final bread slice on top. Make sure that the buttered side is facing up. When you grill the sandwich, the butter will help make the bread nice and crispy. The number of slices of ham and cheese does not have to be exact. You can use more/less of ham or cheese depending on your personal taste. Cheddar is the most popular choice, but you can also use other cheeses as well, such as Comté, Gouda, Gruyere, Monterey Jack, or Swiss. For an added punch of flavor, add some ranch dressing on top of the ham and cheese before you put the final slice of bread down. Place a skillet on the stove and let it get hot; you do not need to add any butter on it. Once the skillet is hot enough, place the sandwich on it and let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes. The sandwich is ready when the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown. Use a heavy pot to press the sandwich down before you flip it and just before you take it off the skillet. This will flatten the sandwich and make it easier to eat. You can serve it as it is, or add a side, such as chips or fries.

(Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505.

Here are possible answers to this question: - depression - revelation - new thought - fatigue - knowledge I believe the correct choice is \\"fatigue\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"fatigue. When we think hard and long about something, our brain uses a considerable amount of energy to process that information. This, in turn, can lead to mental exhaustion, also known as cognitive fatigue. When we experience cognitive fatigue, our brain function slows down, and our ability to concentrate, retain information, and make decisions become impaired. While the other options like revelation, new thought, and knowledge can indeed be outcomes of hard and long thinking, they do not directly result from the act of thinking itself. On the other hand, fatigue is a direct consequence of extended mental effort. Depression is not the correct choice because, while excessive rumination may exacerbate or contribute to depressive symptoms in some individuals, thinking hard and long is not inherently tied to depression, nor does it cause depression in a general sense.

All films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place. In 1894, the Lumiere-family men [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper. Not a small enterprise; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits - innovative for that time. It was located at Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What caused Louis Lumiere to become interested in building a Cinematagraph, in 1894, remains open for speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison organization's Kinetoscope (peep-show machine), in Paris during the fall of 1894, provided the catalyst. W.K.L. Dickson, of Edison's staff, invented a motion-picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in February 1893. It was electrically operated (using power from from heavy storage batteries. This massive machine pumped celluloid film strip (newly developed by the Eastman company) past a lens at about 40 frames-per-second (fps). It was ensconced, as an almost immovable object, in the \\"Black Maria\\" (essentially the first movie studio.) The Kinetescope machines showed staged presentations (less than one-minute long)that were filmed in this studio. During 1894, Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving-picture camera. He had determined that, even at 16 fps on celluloid film, the persistence-of-vision of the human eye/brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived. His camera, dubbed the Cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps. The size and light weight, of the camera (it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source) made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event (provided there was enough sunlight available.) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: trick-riding by some cavalry men; a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon. Using a Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science. The images were projected on a screen five-meters distant from the lens. The screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms. At a meeting of professional photographers, that same year, Louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival. With accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films would be about one-minute long, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, photographing the egress of employees at quitting-time. The public venue chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as the \\"fairground barker\\" for the Cinematograph - was the Salon Indien of the Grand Cafe on the boulevard des Capucines in Paris. It was a wintry Saturday night on 28 December, 1895. As the first audience sat, they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the Lumiere factory (with closed gates.) Some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of Lumiere photographs. But then the crank on the camera/projector was turned and movement began. Louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking. This film has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the beginning, the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace; during the middle, the people stream out - with many trying to ignore the camera, and the cameraman, as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them. At the end, the gates to the factory are being closed. And this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review can be seen as informative and neutral, as it provides a detailed historical background on the development of motion pictures and the Lumiere family's contribution to the field before 1912.

Context: Upon the kingdom's establishment soon after World War I, the country suffered from economic decline, budget deficits, and high inflation as a result of the loss of economically important territories under the Treaty of Trianon, including Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The land losses of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 caused Hungary to lose agricultural and industrial areas, making it dependent on exporting products from what agricultural land it had left to maintain its economy. Prime Minister István Bethlen's government dealt with the economic crisis by seeking large foreign loans, which allowed the country achieve monetary stabilization in the early 1920s. He introduced a new currency in 1927, the pengő. Industrial and farm production rose rapidly, and the country benefited from flourishing foreign trade during most of the 1920s. Following the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the prosperity rapidly collapsed in the country, especially in part due to the economic effects of the failure of the Österreichische Creditanstalt bank in Vienna, Austria. From the mid-1930s to the 1940s, after relations improved with Germany, Hungary's economy benefited from trade. The Hungarian economy became dependent on that of Germany. Question: How many years after the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 did the start of the Great Depression take place? Answer:","completion":"The Treaty of Trianon took place in 1920, and the Great Depression started in 1929. To find the number of years between these two events, we can subtract the earlier year from the later year: 1929 (start of the Great Depression) - 1920 (Treaty of Trianon) = 9 years So, the start of the Great Depression took place 9 years after the Treaty of Trianon in 1920."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is the formation of clouds through the process of evaporation and condensation. This essential step is responsible for the initial formation of clouds, which later leads to the development of snowflakes. Here's the detailed explanation of the entire process, including the missing first step: 1. Evaporation and Condensation: The process begins when the Sun's energy heats up water present on the Earth's surface (such as rivers, lakes, and oceans), causing it to evaporate and transform into water vapor. This water vapor then gets carried up into the atmosphere by air currents. As it rises, it cools down and condenses, forming small water droplets around tiny dust particles present in the air. These water droplets eventually cluster together to form clouds. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: Clouds consist of these tiny water droplets that have condensed onto dust particles in the atmosphere. The density and size of the water droplets determine the type of clouds formed (e.g., cumulus, stratus, or cirrus). 3. The air gets cold: For snow to form, the temperature needs to be cold enough so that the water droplets in the cloud will freeze rather than staying in their liquid state or turning into rain. When air currents carry the clouds higher or the surrounding temperature drops, the water droplets in the clouds begin to cool down. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: As temperatures reach or fall below freezing (0°C / 32°F), the water droplets in the clouds start turning into tiny ice crystals. At this stage, these ice crystals are still microscopic and don't yet resemble snowflakes. 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: As the temperature continues to stay below freezing, the ice crystals in the clouds begin to accumulate and stick together to form snowflakes. When enough ice crystals adhere to one another, they create the distinct snowflake shape we are familiar with. Snowflakes can consist of anywhere from 2 to 200 separate ice crystals, and their unique structure is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure at the time of formation. Once the snowflakes have formed, they continue to grow and eventually fall to the ground as snow if the atmospheric conditions remain favorable. If the temperature increases before reaching the ground, the snowflakes may melt and turn into rain or other types of precipitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to reliable sources close to Bonas, the 25-year-old dancer and model has confided in friends that she has no intention of becoming a royal bride within the next year, despite the couple's recent two-year anniversary. The young couple, who were introduced by Princess Eugenie, have been dating since 2012 and Harry has made it abundantly clear that he has fallen head over heels for the lovely Cressida. The 33-year-old prince, who is currently sixth in line for the British throne, has always been candid about his desire to settle down and start a family as his older brother, Prince William, has done with the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. Friends and insiders close to Bonas claim that although she deeply cares for Harry and their relationship has grown more serious in recent weeks, she is hesitant about taking the plunge into married life. According to their close acquaintances, Cressida is enjoying her career as a dancer and model and is currently at a stage in her life where she is not prepared for the immense responsibility and life changes that come with becoming a royal bride. This hesitancy may come as no surprise for those familiar with the intense public scrutiny and expectations that the royal family endures. As a young woman aspiring to develop her career and make a name for herself in her chosen industry, Bonas may simply not be ready to take on the many obligations that come with marrying into such a prominent family. It is worth mentioning that Cressida has had some experience dealing with media attention, as her half-sister, Isabella Calthorpe, was once romantically linked to Prince William before he married Kate Middleton. However, she may still be cautious about the additional attention and scrutiny she would face if she were to become engaged to Prince Harry, or the possibility of her personal life overshadowing her professional accomplishments. In the meantime, Prince Harry seems to be patiently waiting for his lady love to come around, As he remains smitten with her and prepared to be committed to their relationship. The couple continues to enjoy their time together and build a long-lasting bond. In conclusion, while many royal watchers eagerly await news of a potential engagement, it appears that for now, Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas are content with their current level of commitment. As friends of this young couple have stated, they are very much in love, but Cressida is simply not prepared for the next steps towards marriage at this time. Fans of the royal family will no doubt continue to keep a close eye on this relationship, as they hope that one day, Cressida will warm to the idea of becoming Prince Harry's wife and embracing her role as a member of the British monarchy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog.

Help as much as you can. Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Jimothy finish his growth spurt before or after Dwight? Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to determine the exact timeline of individual growth spurts, as they can vary from person to person. However, based on the information provided and considering that Dwight is a junior in high school with higher testosterone levels, it is more likely that Jimothy will finish his growth spurt after Dwight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable.\\" correctly answer the question of When was the Gibson F-5 largely replicated?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Original Loar-signed instruments are sought after and extremely valuable.\\" does not correctly answer the question of when the Gibson F-5 was largely replicated. The statement emphasizes the value and desirability of original Loar-signed instruments, but it does not address the timeline of replication for the Gibson F-5. The Gibson F-5 is a renowned mandolin that was designed by sound engineer and luthier Lloyd Loar in the early 1920s. With its innovative design and superb sound quality, the F-5 mandolin set a new standard for the instrument and influenced countless luthiers in the subsequent years. Lloyd Loar was an acoustical engineer and a skilled musician who worked for Gibson from 1919 to 1924. His primary contributions include the design of the Master Model instruments, among which the Gibson F-5 mandolin was the crown jewel. The original models that Loar personally signed are considered incredibly rare and valuable, often fetching high prices in the collector market. The replication of the Gibson F-5 mandolin began largely in the 1970s and 1980s, when numerous luthiers in the United States and around the world started making their own versions of this iconic instrument. These luthiers aimed to capture the essence of the original F-5 design while adapting it to modern production techniques. Some of the replication efforts were even undertaken by Gibson themselves, in an attempt to reproduce the grace of the original F-5 models. Various factors, such as the scarcity of the Loar-signed F-5 mandolins and the demand for similar high-quality instruments, contributed to the surge of replication in the latter part of the 20th century. Presently, several luthiers and companies manufacture Gibson F-5 inspired or replica mandolins, catering to musicians and collectors who appreciate the exceptional sound and craftsmanship of this historical instrument. In summary, while the statement provided highlights the value of original Loar-signed instruments, it does not address the question of when the Gibson F-5 was largely replicated. Instead, it is essential to know that the replication process began mainly during the 1970s and 1980s and continues till today, as luthiers and companies produce their own versions of the esteemed Gibson F-5 mandolin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

England recovered from a false start at Twickenham and the early loss of full-back Mike Brown to maintain their RBS Six Nations title quest with a resounding win. Stuart Lancaster’s national team were behind for the first quarter of this match, as they struggled to generate the level of intensity shown during their seismic triumph in Cardiff eight days earlier. But when they needed inspiration, it was delivered in stunning fashion by Jonathan Joseph. Following his try-scoring heroics at the Millennium Stadium, the on-song Bath centre illuminated proceedings on his first start in a home Test. The 23-year-old scored twice – either side of half-time – as England made light of their initial problems to cut loose.

A 7-foot-1 former NBA star has been arrested for attempted armed robbery after neighbors spotted him and a friend with masks over their faces trying to break into a rural Washington State home in broad daylight. This is just the latest trouble for 29-year-old Robert Swift, who blew his NBA 20million earnings and was evicted from his Seattle home in 2013. At the time of his arrest, he was a fugitive from justice, wanted for failing to show up for court to answer charges of possession of a sawed-off shotgun from last November. Swift and 28-year-old Carlos Abraham Anderson were busted on Tuesday near Gold Bar, Washington, as they were trying to break into a home there, police told to KIRO-TV. He played four seasons of NBA basketball, but was saddled with injuries, but hasn't been on an","completion":"NBA roster since 2009. After his short-lived NBA career concluded, Swift's life spiraled downward. His financial struggles, substance abuse issues, and legal troubles have tarnished his image and led him to a path filled with despair. Born in Bakersfield, California, Swift was a highly-touted high school prospect and was drafted 12th overall by the Seattle SuperSonics in 2004, directly out of high school. Known for his height and shot-blocking ability, he was considered a promising talent that was supposed to help anchor the SuperSonics' frontcourt for years to come. However, his NBA career never took off as anticipated. Plagued by injuries, his athleticism, and skills on the court never translated into consistent playing time. He only averaged around 15 minutes per game during his stint with the SuperSonics (which later became the Oklahoma City Thunder). Over the span of his NBA career, he played in just 97 games, averaging a mere 4.3 points, 3.9 rebounds, 0.6 assists, and 0.9 blocks per game. After being released by Oklahoma City in 2009, Swift tried to revive his basketball career by playing in the NBA Development League, but he never found his way back to the big league. Beyond his basketball struggles, Swift's life off the court took a turn for the worse. His NBA earnings of 20 million were squandered on luxuries, irresponsible financial decisions, and substance abuse problems. In 2013, he was evicted from his Seattle mansion, which had been found trashed after he left. Swift's legal troubles began in 2011 when he was charged with third-degree malicious mischief and fourth-degree assault after an incident with his girlfriend. The charges were later dismissed, but it was the beginning of a string of legal problems. In November 2015, he was arrested for possession of a sawed-off shotgun, which was discovered during a traffic stop. Swift initially failed to appear in court for the firearm charge, warranting his fugitive status. The attempted armed robbery resulted in his arrest with accomplice Carlos Abraham Anderson. The duo was caught in the act of breaking into a Gold Bar, Washington home while wearing masks over their faces. Swift was charged with first-degree attempted burglary and second-degree unlawful possession of a firearm, a clear indication of his deep descent into a life of crime. Robert Swift's story serves as a cautionary tale of how success and fortunes earned through talent and hard work can be squandered away due to poor decision-making and an inability to handle newfound wealth. In Swift's case, the culmination of injuries, shortcomings on the court, and personal struggles off the field ultimately led to the downfall of a once-promising NBA career and a descent into a life of crime. It's a tragic reminder of the importance of seeking help and maintaining a support system amidst the pressures and trials that come with success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: While applying to college may seem easy, getting in can be tough! When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. Question: Which of the following statements is WRONG?

Is \\"Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic \\"(male friend\\") vs. amiga (\\"female friend\\").\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, your statement about final obstruent devoicing and the example of amic/amiga in Catalan is correct, but this is just one aspect of the various types of endings that Catalan words have. Here's a more comprehensive explanation: Catalan, a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, and some parts of Italy and France, exhibits a wide range of word endings due to its linguistic history, morphology, phonetics, and gender and number distinctions. Some characteristic features of Catalan word endings are: 1. Final obstruent devoicing: As you mentioned, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which is a phonological process where voiced obstruents (i.e., consonants that produce sound through vocal fold vibration) become voiceless at the end of a word. This can occur in words like \\"amic\\" (male friend) and \\"amiga\\" (female friend). 2. Nouns and adjectives: Like other Romance languages, Catalan has gender (masculine and feminine) and number distinctions (singular and plural). Most nouns and adjectives exhibit different endings to show these distinctions: a. Masculine nouns and adjectives typically end in '-o' (singular) and '-s' (plural), e.g., \\"gat\\" (cat) and \\"gats\\" (cats). b. Feminine nouns and adjectives usually end in '-a' (singular) and '-es' (plural), e.g., \\"gata\\" (female cat) and \\"gates\\" (female cats). c. Exceptions exist, such as some masculine nouns and adjectives ending in '-a', e.g., \\"poeta\\" (poet). 3. Verb conjugation: Catalan verbs have different endings to convey information about tense, mood, and the subject of the action. There are three main groups of regular Catalan verbs: '-ar', '-er', and '-re' verbs. Each of these groups has distinct conjugation patterns: a. '-ar' verbs: \\"parlar\\" (to speak) b. '-er' verbs: \\"poder\\" (to be able to) c. '-re' verbs: \\"vendre\\" (to sell) 4. Diminutive and augmentative endings: Catalan also uses diminutive and augmentative suffixes to indicate a change in the size or intensity of a noun. Some common diminutive suffixes include '-et', '-eta', '-ó', and '-ona'. For example: a. 'Gatet' or 'gato' (little cat) b. 'Casaeta' or 'casona' (little house) In conclusion, Catalan words exhibit a rich variety of endings due to the language's grammatical structures, distinctions in gender and number, and phonological processes such as final obstruent devoicing. Additionally, the language's verb conjugations and diminutive and augmentative suffixes contribute to the diversity of word endings in Catalan."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Cuple\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Would \\"A picture of the 1924 Baseball team\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"A picture of the 1924 Baseball team\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question \\"who died on the Florida Gators college baseball team in 2010?\\" as it does not provide relevant information regarding any death on the team in 2010, and instead, refers to a completely different time period, i.e., 1924. To properly answer the question, it is necessary to investigate and identify any player from the Florida Gators college baseball team in 2010 who may have passed away. After researching this topic, there is no particular individual who appears to have died on the team in that year. The Florida Gators college baseball team is a part of the University of Florida's athletic program, competing in NCAA Division I and the Southeastern Conference. The team has a long and storied history that has been filled with numerous accomplishments and achievements, including multiple College World Series (CWS) appearances, conference titles, and individual awards. In 2010, the Florida Gators baseball team, coached by Kevin O'Sullivan, performed well in their season. They finished the season with an impressive 47-17 record and ultimately advanced to the College World Series. However, they were eliminated after a loss to Florida State University. Despite the apparent absence of a death involving a team member in 2010, it is important to note that college baseball teams, like other sports teams, are not immune to tragic events. Over the years, there have been instances in which athletes from various college programs have faced untimely deaths due to accidents, health issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. These incidents serve as sobering reminders of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing our time with those we care about. In conclusion, \\"A picture of the 1924 Baseball team\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question about a death on the Florida Gators college baseball team in 2010. Instead, it is essential to address the specific year, team, and circumstances involved while acknowledging that no reported death seems to have occurred for the team in 2010."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Carrie gets her first period, and after becoming distressed, cries out for help. Instead of helping, the other girls ridicule and harass her, throwing out tampons, sanitary towels and toilet paper to her. Teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) rushes in to stop the commotion. White, who appears to be bottling extreme rage, snaps a light bulb. After questioning Carrie, Miss Collins realizes that Carrie is unaware of the concept of menstruation. Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma. Upon her way home, Carrie uses her recently discovered telekinesis to stop a boy from teasing her. While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them. The leader of the clique, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), refuses to participate, and as punishment, is banned from the upcoming prom. Furious, she blames Carrie for her misfortune. Meanwhile, another one of the girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feels guilty about her part in teasing Carrie, so she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to the prom. Tommy begrudgingly agrees. After Tommy asks her to the prom, Carrie refuses, thinking that yet another trick is being played on her. After a comforting pep talk with Miss Collins, and after Tommy's further insistence, Carrie finally agrees to go to the prom with Tommy.While everyone else is getting ready for the prom, Chris schemes with her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) and best friend Norma (P.J.

If I tell you that An animal must find a mate to ensure survival, and ask you the question \\"what must an animal find to ensure survival?\\", is the correct answer \\"disaster\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"disaster.\\" Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that an animal must find a mate to ensure survival. This is because finding a mate is essential for the reproduction and continuation of a species. In the context of the question, \\"disaster\\" is not relevant. While some animals may need to be resilient in the face of disasters, such as natural catastrophes or environmental changes, this does not address the need for an animal to find a mate. To ensure survival, each animal species needs to have a sustainable population size to propagate its genes. When animals reproduce, they pass on their genetic material to their offspring, ensuring the continuation of their species. Apart from finding a mate, there are several other factors that contribute to an animal's survival, including: 1. Access to food and water: For an animal to survive, it must have access to a reliable source of food and water. Animals need nutrients and sustenance to maintain their health, grow, and reproduce. 2. Shelter and habitat: An animal must find a suitable habitat or shelter that meets its specific needs related to shelter, protection from predators, and environmental conditions. The habitat should provide adequate cover from predators and be well-suited for the animal's lifestyle and physical attributes. 3. Ability to adapt to changing environments: Animals must be able to adapt to changes in their environment in order to survive. This is especially relevant in the case of climate change or habitat destruction, where an organism's environment may change dramatically, requiring flexibility and adaptability on the part of the animal. 4. Avoidance of predation: To ensure their survival, animals must be able to avoid or escape from predators. This may involve developing physical adaptations, such as camouflage or speed, or behavioral adaptations, such as living in groups or engaging in defensive behaviors like fighting back or warning calls. 5. Successful competition: For an animal to survive, it must be able to successfully compete with other members of its species for resources such as food, water, and mates, as well as with other species that occupy the same ecological niche. In conclusion, while disaster resilience can be important for some animals, the main factors contributing to an animal's survival include finding a mate, having access to food and water, finding a suitable habitat, avoiding predation, and being able to adapt to its environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why was this rejection problematic?\\" is in \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic.

Write an article based on this \\"\\"I am telling the West,\\" said Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on television last Tuesday, \\"that dropping bombs from the air will not provide a solution.\\"\\"","completion":"Title: The Importance of a Comprehensive Approach to Counter-Terrorism: Insights from President Erdogan's Call for Perspective Introduction On a recent television broadcast last Tuesday, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the Western powers to reconsider their approach to combating terrorism. \\"I am telling the West,\\" he said, \\"that dropping bombs from the air will not provide a solution.\\" Erdogan's statement highlights the need for a more holistic and nuanced response to the complex and ever-evolving global issue of terrorism. In this article, we will explore the limitations of a purely military approach to counter-terrorism, the potential benefits of alternative strategies, and the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terror. Limitations of a Solely Military Approach While airstrikes can serve as valuable tools in targeting terrorist leaders or disrupting their operations, President Erdogan's comment emphasizes the reality that a purely military response cannot, on its own, eradicate terrorism. For one, airstrikes run the risk of causing civilian casualties, and this collateral damage can foster resentment and disillusionment among the local populations - emotions that terrorist organizations often exploit. Additionally, a focus on military action alone may neglect some of the root causes of terrorism, such as socio-political marginalization, economic disparities, and radical ideologies, which must be addressed to prevent the emergence of new generations of extremists. Alternative Strategies and Their Benefits President Erdogan's call to reconsider the use of airstrikes offers an opportunity to explore alternative strategies in combating terrorism. Some of these alternative strategies include: 1. Intelligence-led operations: Strengthening intelligence gathering and analysis can help identify and neutralize potential terrorist threats. Enhanced collaboration between national and international security agencies can be especially beneficial in this regard. 2. Supporting socio-political and economic development: Addressing the underlying socio-economic issues that can fuel radicalization and extremism is critical in curtailing the spread of terrorism. Investment in education, healthcare, and economic development can help to create stable societies that are less susceptible to radicalization. 3. Countering extremist ideologies: Engaging with religious and community leaders, as well as leveraging social media platforms, can play a vital role in challenging and discrediting extremist narratives. 4. Promoting international cooperation: No single country can effectively counter global terrorist networks. Therefore, fostering strong international partnerships is crucial in ensuring a unified and collaborative response to terrorism. The Importance of International Cooperation As President Erdogan's statement emphasizes, effective counter-terrorism efforts require a deep understanding of the causes and nuances of terrorism and collaboration at a global level. By sharing resources and intelligence, countries can pool their expertise, thereby increasing their capacity to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. Equally important is the need for nations to engage in diplomatic dialogues and initiatives aimed at building trust, promoting regional stability, and establishing security norms. Conclusion President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's recent plea to the Western nations serves as a strong reminder of the importance of pursuing a comprehensive strategy for counter-terrorism. While military action may constitute a necessary component of this strategy, a sustainable and lasting resolution to terrorism requires addressing its root causes, investing in alternative approaches, and fostering collaborative efforts with international partners. In recognizing the limitations of an exclusively military response to terrorism, the global community can begin the essential task of developing more efficient, adaptive, and cooperative strategies for ensuring a safer world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two highly conserved residues in the peptide were identified as being important for the membrane ordering effect. Aggregation of large unilamellar vesicles induced by the peptide was also found to be correlated with the membrane ordering effect of the peptide, indicating that an increase in membrane ordering, i.e., membrane dehydration, is important for vesicle aggregation.

Article: My neighbor Mrs. Gargan first told me about it. \\"Have you seen the tree?\\" She asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the autumn twilight . \\"The one down at the corner,\\" she explained. \\"It's a beautiful tree--all kinds of colors. All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it.\\" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. \\"If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,\\" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder.

How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.

There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, \\"This can't be right! 100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?\\" The engineer wrote out a new bill: \\"For tapping a machine, 1; for knowing where to tap. 99.\\" The engineer who repaired the machine was right in charging 100 because _ .

First question: How can we find 1's complement and 2's complement (for both positive and negative decimal numbers)? Second question: Why does 2's complement is preferred to represent negative numbers over 1's complement? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. Let's answer each question step by step. 1. How can we find 1's complement and 2's complement (for both positive and negative decimal numbers)? To find 1's and 2's complement of a number(constant), you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Convert the decimal number to its binary representation. For positive decimal numbers: - Use the standard binary conversion method: Divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. For negative decimal numbers: - Convert the magnitude of the number into binary (ignoring the negative sign) - Find the 2's complement of the binary number (explained below) Step 2: Find 1's complement. - In the binary representation, invert all the bits, i.e., replace 1's with 0's and 0's with 1's. Step 3: Find 2's complement. - Add 1 to the 1's complement. - If there is a carry-out (extra 1) from the most significant bit, discard it. So to find 1's and 2's complement of positive and negative numbers: For positive decimal numbers: - Convert the number to binary directly (step 1) - Find 1's complement (step 2) - Find 2's complement (step 3) For negative decimal numbers: - Convert the magnitude to binary (step 1) - Find the 2's complement of the binary number (step 3) - The 1's complement will be one less than the 2's complement 2. Why is 2's complement preferred to represent negative numbers over 1's complement? There are several reasons why 2's complement is preferred over 1's complement to represent negative numbers: - In 1's complement, there are two representations of zero - 00000000 (positive zero) and 11111111 (negative zero). This can cause confusion and require extra steps to handle during computation. 2's complement has only one representation of zero. - 2's complement makes it easy to perform arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction. For example, when you add two numbers in 2's complement representation, you do not need to worry about the sign of the numbers. The result in 2's complement representation will also correctly represent the signed outcome (i.e., positive or negative). - Overflow detection is simpler in 2's complement representation. When performing addition and subtraction, an overflow can be detected when the carry-in and carry-out in the most significant bit have different values. In contrast, overflow checking in 1's complement is more complex and less efficient. In conclusion, the two questions are different. The first question is about finding 1's and 2's complement of decimal numbers, while the second question discusses the reasons for preferring 2's complement over 1's complement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's break down the reasons behind this perception by analyzing the components that contribute to its positive sentiment. 1. The choice of the adjective \\"superb\\" suggests excellence and superior quality, indicating that the performances being described greatly surpassed expectations and standards. In comparison to other positive adjectives like \\"good\\" or \\"great,\\" \\"superb\\" carries a stronger and more exceptional connotation. The word choice here plays a key role in conveying the positive sentiment of the sentence. 2. The addition of the adverb \\"throughout\\" implies consistency and thoroughness in the high quality of the performances. This means that the positivity extends across the entire length or duration of the performances, without any instances of decline or disappointment. This consistently high level of excellence further reinforces the positive sentiment associated with this sentence. 3. The context in which the sentence might be used could involve describing an event, concert, theatrical production, or even a season of a sports team. In any of these situations, praising all aspects of the performances demonstrates appreciation, enthusiasm, and admiration for the performers or participants involved. This further contributes to the positive sentiment of the sentence. To sum up, the sentiment of the sentence \\"superb performances throughout\\" is likely to be perceived as highly positive due to the choice of the words \\"superb\\" and \\"throughout,\\" and the context in which it might be used.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Who doesn’t like babies? Well . . . Adapted from an online discussion. Hi, Carolyn! My husband and I recently had our first baby. My husband’s brother and his wife are happily child-free and have shown zero interest in our daughter — they’ve never interacted with her, never ask about her, never respond to the few pictures my husband sends them, and have told us outright they “don’t like babies.” I don’t expect them to act like she is the center of their world, but our extended family is tiny, and we’d hoped our daughter would have a strong relationship with her aunt and uncle. Am I wrong to think it’s generally polite to feign interest in things that are clearly important to people you love? Do we hope they take an interest when she’s older? Or accept that our once-close relationship has changed for good? My husband is hurt by his brother’s lack of interest, but neither of us can think of a productive way to talk with them about this. Cold-Shouldered: Yes, it’s generally polite for the people who love us to give some minimal level of a damn about the things we care about (see also here, second letter: bit.ly/EekAbaby). Yes, people who avoid babies can become more interested as the child grows more interesting, though you don’t become Uncle Awesome by skipping the hard years. And, yes, do accept that the relationship has changed, because there was no way it wouldn’t change after adding a child. What I don’t suggest is tacking on the needlessly extreme “for good.” Who knows what’s in store. Maybe you’ll keep drifting apart, maybe you’ll get over this obstacle quickly, maybe you’ll reconnect after peak child-immersion has passed. I also suggest not letting stand their remark that they “don’t like babies”: “Few people in their right minds ‘like’ babies — we like you two, though, and miss you, and want Baby to know you as she grows up.” Back that up by asking, talking and caring about their lives as well. Re: Babies: It’s not socially acceptable to say, “I don’t like old people,” or, “I don’t like gay people,” so why is it okay to say, “I don’t like kids”? Anonymous: These aren’t equivalent at all. Being old or gay is just one facet of the abundance of them that make us who we are, and judging the whole person on these single traits makes the judge, to use your term, “socially unacceptable,” though that’s going easy. Being a baby, on the other hand, means your menu of behaviors is limited to crying, screaming, pooping, sleeping, upchucking, needing and occasionally dazzling someone with a smile or eye contact. Plus, they don’t know when you dodge them. Re: Babies: Babies are terrible. No one in their right mind likes babies. Once you have a kid, your brain chemistry is rewired to force you to think your baby is amazing. That’s why we give them so much nurturing. The aunt and uncle will be more involved as the baby turns into an actual interesting person, rather than a selfish blob. Anonymous 2: Indeed.

Which friend started taking statins for his disease? Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Movie title: I'll Never Heil Again Movie plot: I'll Never Heil Again follows much the same pattern as You Nazty Spy!. It opens at the estate of King Herman the 6 7/8s, the deposed, abeit exiled king of Moronica. Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey. Larry parodies the attempts to control Greece by saying, \\"I'll wipe out grease.\\") The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges. Glinda enters, and starts to place in Moe's mind the idea that his allies, the \\"Axle\\" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with an exploding 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the game the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics avoiding the exploding ball by swerving around it and jumping over it colliding with Herring's head. The result of this was Herring 'barking' at the exploding ball and upon Hailstone's order to put it down he rips off his mustache, causing Hailstone to remark the well remembered line \\"give me my personality.\\"The film's climax occurs when the \\"Axle\\" partners arrive for a meeting and Hailstone orders the \\"Axle\\" partners Chizzilini (a parody of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini), the Bey... The answer is:","completion":"King Herman was deposed as the king from the fictional country of Moronica in the movie \\"I'll Never Heil Again.\\" This comedy film presents a satirical take on the political landscape of the time, specifically targeting the dictatorial regimes in power during World War II. The movie plot revolves around King Herman the 6 7/8s, who is in exile, and his attempts to regain his throne with the help of war profiteers Ixnay, Ohnay, and Amscray. These war profiteers initially supported Moe Hailstone (a parody of Adolf Hitler), but later realize the consequences of their actions and decide to aid King Herman in reclaiming his position as ruler of Moronica. King Herman dispatches his daughter, Princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring), to assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball.

Body: Diafra Sakho, who has been sidelined for a significant period due to a shoulder injury, is finally expected to make his comeback for the Hammers. The Senegalese striker's return will provide West Ham with a timely lift, as they have missed his presence and goal-scoring ability upfront. Manager Sam Allardyce will be hoping that Sakho's return can help the team maintain their impressive start to the season. Both Sakho and Allardyce have recently been rewarded for their performances, receiving the Premier League player and manager of the month awards respectively. In another positive development for West Ham fans, Andy Carroll may also make his first appearance this season after recovering from a long-term injury. The English striker's physical presence and aerial prowess will be instrumental in bolstering the Hammers' attack, providing them with a different dimension to their forward line. However, the upcoming match will prove to be a challenge for their opponents Aston Villa, who have been struggling in recent weeks. Villa's miseries were compounded last week when their Belgian striker, Christian Benteke, received a red card and a subsequent three-match ban. His absence will be a significant blow to the team, as they desperately seek to end their losing streak. Aston Villa has lost six consecutive league games for the first time since 1967, and the mounting pressure on manager Paul Lambert is palpable. The Villans will need to dig deep and produce a spirited performance to overcome their recent poor form and avoid further dropping down the Premier League table. Conclusion: In conclusion, West Ham United's clash against Aston Villa is shaping up to be an enthralling encounter as both teams aim to secure a vital three points. With key players returning from injury and impressive awards under their belt, the Hammers will be confident of extending their good run. In contrast, Aston Villa will need to display resilience and determination to avoid a record-breaking seventh consecutive league defeat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The main differences can be observed in the structure of the sentences and the choice of words: 1. The original sentence is written as one sentence with the use of commas, whereas the paraphrase is divided into two sentences. 2. The father's name is slightly altered: Forest (original) vs. Wald (paraphrase); this doesn't greatly impact the understanding of the sentence since it preserves the father's role and business. 3.

Choices: - animal shelter - backyard - own home - basket - garage The rationale to choose \\"basket\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"A basket is an ideal choice for a small dog to sleep in for several reasons. The reasons are listed and explained below: 1. Provides Comfort and Security: A basket provides a small dog with a comfortable and snug place to rest. Since a dog's natural instinct is to find a secure and sheltered place to sleep, the enclosed structure of a basket offers the sense of security they seek. This sense of security helps reduce stress and anxiety in pets, which in turn promotes a healthy lifestyle. 2. Retains Warmth: A well-chosen dog basket, especially one with soft padding or cushions, effectively retains warmth. This is particularly important for small dogs as they tend to lose body heat more quickly than larger dogs. A warm and cozy basket not only ensures a comfortable sleep but also protects the dog from catching a cold or suffering from joint pains caused by cold surfaces. 3. Easy to Clean and Maintain: Baskets, unlike some other dog bedding options, are generally easy to clean and maintain. Most baskets come with removable, washable cushion covers or liners, which can be machine-washed, keeping the dog's sleeping area fresh and hygienic. Additionally, the basket itself can be easily wiped down and sanitized regularly. 4. Mobility and Portability: Baskets are lightweight and can be easily moved around the house, allowing you to place them in different rooms as needed. This helps to ensure that your dog always has a comfortable and familiar place to sleep wherever they are in the home. 5. Space Saving: A basket occupies minimal space as it can be chosen according to the size of the dog. A small dog will need a small basket, which can be easily placed in a corner of a room or under a table, thus not taking up too much space in the home. 6. Prevents Damage to Furniture: Dogs can be prone to scratching, biting, or chewing on furniture, and some may even prefer to sleep on sofas or beds if given the chance. A designated sleeping area like a basket not only protects the furniture from potential damage but also helps to set boundaries and establish routines for your pet. 7. Customizable: Baskets can be customized to suit the specific needs of your dog. For example, a dog with orthopedic issues might need a basket with better support, and baskets can be found that cater to their needs. Moreover, you can add your dog's favorite blanket or toy to make the basket more inviting and comforting. 8. Aesthetically Pleasing: Baskets come in a variety of designs, materials, and colors, allowing you to choose one that complements your home's decor. A well-chosen basket adds a touch of elegance to your living space while ensuring your dog's comfort and wellbeing. In conclusion, a basket is the optimal choice for a small dog's sleeping area as it offers comfort, security, warmth, and a customizable and hygienic environment that caters to their needs. The portability and space-saving features of a basket, along with the fact that it can be an aesthetically pleasing addition to the home, make it a superior choice compared to the other options listed."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Many private institutions of higher education around the country are in danger. Not all will be saved, and perhaps not all deserve to be saved. There are low-quality schools just as there are low-quality businesses. We have no duty to save them simply because they exist. But many promising institutions that deserve to continue are threatened. They are doing a fine job educationally, but they are caught in a financial squeeze, with no way to reduce rising cost or increase income significantly. Raising tuition doesn't bring in more income, for each time tuition goes up, the enrollment goes down, or the amount that must be given away in student aid goes up. Schools are bad businesses, whether public or private, not usually because of mismanagement but because of the nature of the enterprise. They lose money on every customer, and they can go bankrupt either from too few students or too many students. Even a very good college is a very bad business. It is such colleges, promising but threatened, that I worry about. Low enrollment is not their chief problem. Even with full enrollment, they may _ . Efforts to save them, and preferably to keep them private, are a national necessity. There is no basis for arguing that private schools are inherently better than public schools. There are many examples to the contrary. Anyone can name state universities and colleges that rank as the finest in the nation and the world. It is now inevitable that public institutions will be dominant, and therefore diversity is a national necessity. Diversity in the way we support schools tends to give us a healthy diversity in the forms of education. In an imperfect society such as ours, uniformity of education throughout the nation could be dangerous, In an imperfect society, diversity is a positive good. Supporters of public higher education know the importance of sustaining private higher education.

One day over 800 years ago, a young human warlord named Niran fell in love with one of the song neng, a woman named Sang. Niran wanted Sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. In her pain and rage, Sang attacked and bit Niran during a Songkran (New Year) solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. From Niran's bloodline have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill for pleasure). Only Sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. Doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. Since the coming Songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, Sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and thus wipe out all the vampires in Thailand. Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are vacationing in Thailand during this year's Songkran festival. Connor, trained since childhood in Muay Thai (Thai boxing), takes Amanda to see a match. However, Amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. On the way, she gets lost in the Phang Nga market, and Mr Nice Guy (Dom Hetrakul) offers to show her the way to her hotel. He leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then turns into the vampire Niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. Connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. Just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. Connor begs for his help finding Amanda, but he warns Connor to leave Thailand immediately and threatens to kill Connor if he follows him. Connor stealthily follows Kiko (Roger Yuan) home to Kong Sai House. When the police refuse to consider Amanda missing until 48 hours have passed, Connor goes back to Kong Sai House, only...

Twitter finally flicks the switch on 10,000 character DMs Twitter users can now send direct messages (DM) of up to 10,000 characters, three months after the company announced the forthcoming change to users and developers on its development blog. The new DMs, which are intended to be of effectively unlimited length for the typical user, are part of the company’s long-running effort to upgrade its messaging service to make it a more competitive alternative to market leaders such as Facebook’s WhatsApp and Messenger apps. Sachin Agarwal, Twitter’s DM product manager, said: “We believe that private messaging is a core part of the twitter experience. Where we see our advantage [over apps such as WhatsApp] is that there’s so much amazing content on Twitter already, that we want to enable people to have private conversations about those things.” After years spent all-but-abandoned, the company turned its attention to updating its direct messages towards the end of 2014, first enabling group DMs with multiple participants, and then announcing the change in DM length earlier this year. As a result, Agarwal accepted that Twitter still has to win back trust from users before they will devote time to the feature. Nonetheless, he said: “We’ve won back a lot of trust, but we still have a long way to go. Users are really excited about it, we’re seeing our numbers skyrocket.” Unusually for Twitter, the change in DM length was pre-announced. Agarwal said that it was important to make sure that all third-party clients are updated before the feature is turned on. “What we didn’t want was for it to be enabled for one client but not for others,” because that way users may be sent messages that they couldn’t read. Typically, Twitter is unconcerned about third-party clients, preferring users to stick to the company’s own software, but Agarwal said that a big target for unlimited DMs is business users, who will appreciate being able to hold real conversations with customers in DM. Since enterprise users are often on third party clients such as Hootsuite, they need the time to switch over. “One of the really interesting uses of DM is talking to business and getting customer support, and those are using third party clients. We have a number of partners that build clients for these businesses and so we wanted to make sure they had the time to update and be ready. “Let’s say that I’m talking to a business and I write them a direct message that is 160 characters long and that business doesn’t read the last 20, for me as a consumers thats a really bad experience. And that was how we looked at it, the users’ perspective, making sure they have a really great experience.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Twitter has now enabled its users to send direct messages (DMs) of up to 10,000 characters, a significant increase from the previous limit of 140 characters. This change was announced back in June and is part of Twitter's ongoing effort to improve its messaging service and compete with other messaging platforms such as Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger apps. Twitter's DM Product Manager, Sachin Agarwal, said that private messaging is a core part of the Twitter experience, and the platform's advantage is the abundant content available on Twitter that can spark private conversations among users. The company had previously added the ability to create group DMs with multiple participants and realized that they still had to regain users' trust in this feature. As a result of these changes, Twitter's DM usage numbers have been growing rapidly. The increased character limit was pre-announced to ensure that third-party clients would have it enabled before the feature went live. Agarwal mentioned that a significant target for unlimited DMs is business users, who will benefit from holding more in-depth conversations with customers through DMs. Many enterprise users rely on third-party clients like Hootsuite, so they needed time to transition and update to the new feature. In summary, Twitter has extended the character limit for DMs to 10,000 characters as part of its effort to improve messaging services and compete with other messaging apps. The company aims to win back user trust and target business users who can benefit from more detailed conversations with customers through the enhanced DM feature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The correct answer is A because the griddle is the appropriate surface for cooking pancakes. Cooking pancakes on a griddle provides even heat distribution, which helps them to cook evenly and achieve a golden brown color on both sides. Flipping the pancakes when bubbles rise ensures that they are cooked properly. Option B is incorrect because it suggests scooping the batter onto the counter, which is not a suitable surface for cooking pancakes. The counter will not provide the necessary heat to cook the pancakes, and attempting to do so would likely create a mess and result in uncooked or unevenly cooked pancakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Get rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire. Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly. Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength. For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking. For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes. For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook. You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of \\"2 Mississippi\\" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle. You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the \\"top\\" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot. A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch. Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly. Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will \\"catch,\\" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire. Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning. Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught. Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill. You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes. If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long. Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid. Summary:","completion":"This article provides detailed instructions on how to properly set up a charcoal grill by cleaning out ash, arranging briquettes, using lighter fluid safely, and maintaining an even distribution of heat for optimal cooking results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: Rizwan Khan, the protagonist in the movie \\"My Name Is Khan,\\" suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. Asperger's Syndrome is a type of neurodevelopmental disorder that falls on the autism spectrum. It is characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive or restricted patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. People with Asperger's Syndrome usually have average or above-average intelligence and do not experience the same degree of delay in language development as those with other forms of autism. In the film, Rizwan Khan, played by Shah Rukh Khan, is a Muslim man from India who has been living in the United States with his family. Throughout the movie, his character showcases various symptoms and characteristics associated with Asperger's Syndrome. Due to Rizwan's condition, he struggles to understand social cues and norms, often resulting in awkward and challenging situations in his relationships with others. The film highlights his journey to deal with the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the prejudice faced by Muslims in America while also showcasing his unique perspective and determination to prove his innocence. The portrayal of Rizwan Khan's character as a protagonist with Asperger's Syndrome was praised by many for raising awareness about the disorder and reducing the stigma associated with autism. The film showcases the strengths and potential of individuals with autism and emphasizes their ability to make a difference, overcome obstacles, and thrive despite their condition.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring lands experienced different climates. In Iceland, the actions of its people lead to a loss of animal and plant species. Denmark tried to keep the environment untouched as they understood its importance and the climate was unaffected.

Each piece seemed to be intricately linked to another, creating a seamless network of components that worked in harmony, like a well-orchestrated symphony. It was clear that the creator of this armor was a genius – and perhaps a dangerous one at that. After finally removing the last piece of armor, they carefully wrapped the individual components in a specialized material to prevent any potential damage during transport to the lab. Once everything was secured, they turned their attention back to the unconscious man, who remained eerily still throughout the entire process. \\"We need to get him to a secure location,\\" she said, her concern for the man's wellbeing evident in her voice. \\"We don't know how long he's been wearing this armor or what kind of physical or psychological toll it may have taken on him.\\" He nodded in agreement, swiftly lifting the man into a fireman's carry. As they made their way out of the area, they couldn't help but glance back at the discarded armor, realizing that their discovery could have far-reaching implications. The potential for advanced military applications, enhanced human capabilities, or even the possible involvement of a hostile foreign power weighed heavily on their minds. Upon arriving at the lab, they quickly set to work analyzing the armor's components, delving into every detail of its design and studying the high-tech materials that comprised it. Meanwhile, their unconscious captive was placed under constant observation, with medical professionals on standby to provide any necessary treatment. In the days and weeks that followed, the armor would yield many secrets, including the true extent of its capabilities and the identity of its mysterious creator. And as they unraveled these discoveries, they would find themselves embroiled in a high-stakes game of international intrigue and espionage – one that could shake the very foundations of their world. But for now, all they could do was work diligently, their minds focused on the task at hand, knowing that the answers they sought were concealed within the sophisticated technology before them. And with each new revelation, they grew increasingly aware that they were not just dealing with a simple piece of armor, but something much greater – a technological marvel that could forever change the course of human history."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch .

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The album included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, \\"Jugband Blues\\". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", \\"Let There Be More Light\\" and \\"Corporal Clegg\\". Wright composed \\"See-Saw\\" and \\"Remember a Day\\". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \\"Remember a Day\\", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, \\"Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise'\\". As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking \\"like an architectural diagram\\".Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to \\"forget it as background music to a party\\". John Peel described a live performance of the title track as \\"like a religious experience\\", while NME described the song as \\"long and boring ...

Circadian rhythm Melatonin is absent from the system or undetectably low during daytime. Its onset in dim light, dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), at roughly 21:00 (9 p.m.) can be measured in the blood or the saliva. Its major metabolite can also be measured in morning urine. Both DLMO and the midpoint (in time) of the presence of the hormone in the blood or saliva have been used as circadian markers. However, newer research indicates that the melatonin offset may be the more reliable marker. Benloucif et al. found that melatonin phase markers were more stable and more highly correlated with the timing of sleep than the core temperature minimum.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: To tell if your indoor plants need water","completion":"Telling if your indoor plants need water is a crucial aspect of maintaining their health and growth. An appropriate watering schedule ensures that the plants receive just the right amount of water, as overwatering and underwatering can be harmful. Here is a comprehensive guide with several methods to evaluate if your indoor plants need water: 1. Soil moisture test: This is the most reliable and common method to check your plant's water requirements. Gently stick your finger in the soil up to the second knuckle and feel for moisture. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water the plant. If it still feels damp, give it some more time before the next watering session. 2. Weight test: Familiarize yourself with the weight of your plant and its container after watering it. The weight of the pot will give you a clear gauge of whether it needs more water or not. As the soil dries and the plant absorbs water, the weight decreases. If the pot feels significantly lighter, it's probably time to water. 3. Visual inspection: Keep an eye on the appearance of your plants as they often exhibit signs of needing water. Wilting and yellowing leaves, curling edges, and drooping stems are some of the common indicators. If any of these signs are present even after watering, it could indicate a more significant problem like root rot or pest infestation. 4. Use a moisture meter: A moisture meter is a small device that measures the moisture content in the soil. Insert the probe into the soil, typically halfway between the edge of the pot and the plant's stem, getting as close to the roots as possible. If the meter indicates that the soil is dry, the plant needs water. 5. Surface soil examination: Observe the color and texture of the soil surface. Dry soil usually becomes lighter in color and cracks start to form. Even if the surface appears dry, it's important to check the moisture deeper in the soil with the finger test, as plants can still extract water from deeper soil layers. 6. Plant species requirements: Understand the specific water requirements of the plants you own. Some plants like succulents and cacti need to be watered less frequently, while others may need more frequent watering. Doing proper research about your individual plant's watering needs will help you make a more informed decision. 7. Observe drainage: A pot with proper drainage holes is crucial for your plant's health. Look for excess moisture at the bottom of the pot or saucer if present. If there is standing water or dampness, this could be a sign of overwatering. Conversely, if the pot feels dry, it's time to water the plant. 8. Light and temperature conditions: Different plants have different water requirements based on the environmental circumstances. Generally, plants placed in well-lit and warm locations require more frequent watering than those in shaded, cooler spaces. 9. Container material: The type of container your plant is housed in can also impact its watering requirements. Porous materials like terracotta or clay lose moisture more quickly than plastic or glazed ceramic pots. This means that plants in terracotta pots may need more frequent watering. By carefully monitoring and incorporating these methods, you will be able to effectively determine when your indoor plants need water, ensuring they remain healthy and thriving. Regular observation of your plants and understanding their specific needs is invaluable for any indoor gardener."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century.

In this post-nuclear society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between the apes and the surviving humans. A gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this and plots Caesar's downfall. Caesar is married to Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female ape of the previous film, and they have a son named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's father. Caesar regrets never having known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) tells him about an archive film of his parents where he can also learn about the future. The archives are located in the Forbidden City, now a radioactive ruin. After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory, Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives. However, there are mutants (radiation-scarred humans) still living there under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden). Caesar and his party view the recordings of Cornelius and Zira and learn about the future of the world, but barely have time to study the tapes before they have to escape being captured. Caesar assembles a meeting to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up and he leads the gorillas away. A team of scouts sent by Governor Kolp return and tell him about the Ape City. Kolp considers this covert trip by Caesar an act of espionage. His assistant MÃ©ndez (Paul Stevens) believes they did nothing wrong and should be left alone, but Governor Kolp stubbornly declares war on Ape City, mustering the mutant humans to destroy the ape society.

Write an article based on this summary: – The lawyer for a homeless man in Philadelphia whose selflessness led to donations of over 400,000 said Tuesday that all the money is gone. Johnny Bobbitt's attorney, Chris Fallon, said he learned that the cash was gone during a call with lawyers for Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico, the couple accused in a lawsuit brought by Bobbitt of mismanaging donations they raised for him through GoFundMe. Fallon said he was \\"shocked. Shocked.\\" \\"They raised this money to help Johnny Bobbitt get money for food.\\" The couple, who started the campaign after Bobbitt used his last 20 to help McClure get gas after she ran out late at night, deny the claims in the suit, saying they're wary of giving Bobbitt large sums because they fear he will buy drugs. GoFundMe rep Bobby Whithorne says the company is working with law enforcement to ensure that Bobbitt gets the money raised for him, the AP reports. The crowdfunding site says it will guarantee any misspent money, 6 ABC reports. \\"While we assist law enforcement with their ongoing investigation, GoFundMe is also working with Johnny's legal team to ensure he's receiving support while the remaining funds are being recovered,\\" Whithorne said in a statement, adding that the company gave 20,000 to an account set up by Bobbitt's attorney \\"to provide assistance\\" to him during the investigation. McClure and D'Amico's attorney, Ernest Badway, told the AP they have no comment. They have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. D'Amico has said Bobbitt, a Marine veteran, spent 25,000 in less than two weeks in December on drugs, in addition to paying overdue legal bills and sending his family money. They say they've given Bobbitt about half the money raised, but Fallon says Bobbitt has only received about 75,000, including a camper and a 1999 Ford Ranger. The New Jersey judge in the case ordered the couple to transfer the money into an escrow account by Friday and hire an accountant to review records within 10 days; per NJ 101.5, they missed that deadline. A hearing is set for Wednesday. Article:","completion":"Philadelphia Homeless Man's Donated Funds Disappear: A Tale of Trust, Humanity, and Betrayal In a shocking turn of events, the 400,000 donated to a homeless man in Philadelphia through a crowdfunding campaign is now reportedly gone. The funds were raised for Johnny Bobbitt, whose selfless act of using his last 20 to help a stranded woman, Kate McClure, pay for gas led to his story going viral on social media. McClure and her boyfriend, Mark D'Amico, started the GoFundMe campaign with the aim of helping Bobbitt get back on his feet. Chris Fallon, Bobbitt's attorney, mentioned that he was \\"shocked\\" to learn during a call with McClure and D'Amico's lawyers that the entire amount raised has been spent. \\"They raised this money to help Johnny Bobbitt get money for food,\\" said Fallon. However, McClure and D'Amico have denied allegations mentioned in Bobbitt's lawsuit that they mismanaged the funds. They stated that they had been reluctant to give Bobbitt large sums of money, fearing that he might use it to purchase drugs. GoFundMe representative Bobby Whithorne announced that the company is working closely with law enforcement officers to ensure that Bobbitt receives all the donations made for him. GoFundMe has stated that it will cover any misspent funds, according to 6 ABC reports. In a statement, Whithorne said, \\"While we assist law enforcement with their ongoing investigation, GoFundMe is also working with Johnny's legal team to ensure he's receiving support while the remaining funds are being recovered.\\" The company has also contributed 20,000 to an account set up by Bobbitt's attorney to provide assistance during the ongoing investigation. McClure and D'Amico's attorney, Ernest Badway, has not made any comments regarding the case. Although the couple has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, D'Amico has revealed that Bobbitt, a Marine veteran, spent 25,000 in less than two weeks in December on drugs, legal bills, and sending money to his family. The couple asserts that they have given Bobbitt around half of the money raised; however, Fallon claims Bobbitt has only received approximately 75,000, which includes a camper and a 1999 Ford Ranger. The New Jersey judge presiding over the case has ordered McClure and D'Amico to transfer the funds into an escrow account by Friday and hire an accountant to review their financial records within 10 days. However, it appears that the couple has missed this deadline. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the matter further. This case highlights the unfortunate reality that acts of kindness and trust can sometimes be overshadowed by corruption and deceit. The story of Johnny Bobbitt's selflessness transformed into a heartbreaking example of how a well-meaning crowdfunding initiative can turn into a nightmare. It serves as a stark reminder that transparency, accountability, and rigorous monitoring are crucial while managing funds raised for someone in need.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Edward Henry Weston (March 24, 1886 - January 1, 1958) was a 20th-century American photographer. He has been called \\"one of the most innovative and influential American photographers...\\" and \\"one of the masters of 20th century photography.\\" Over the course of his 40-year career Weston photographed an increasingly expansive set of subjects, including landscapes, still lifes, nudes, portraits, genre scenes and even whimsical parodies. It is said that he developed a \\"quintessentially American, and specially Californian, approach to modern photography\\" because of his focus on the people and places of the American West. Weston was a prolific writer. His Daybooks were published in two volumes totaling more than 500 pages in the first edition. This does not include the years of the journal he kept between 1915 and 1923; for reasons he never made clear he destroyed those before leaving for Mexico. He also wrote dozens of articles and commentaries, beginning in 1906 and ending in 1957, and he hand-wrote or typed at least 5,000 letters to colleagues, friends, lovers, his wives and his children. In addition, Weston kept very thorough notes on the technical and business aspects of his work. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, which now houses most of Weston's archives, reports that it houses 75 linear feet of pages from his Daybooks, correspondence, financial records, memorabilia, and other personal documents in his possession when he died. Among Weston's most important early writings are those that provide insights into his development of the concept of previsualization. He first spoke and wrote about the concept in 1922, at least a decade before Ansel Adams began utilizing the term, and he continued to expand upon this idea both in writing and in his teachings. Historian Beaumont Newhall noted the significance of Weston's innovation in his book The History of Photography, saying \\"The most important part of Edward Weston's approach was his insistence that the photographer should previsualize the final print before making the exposure.\\" In his Daybooks he provided an unusually detailed record of his evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that his images reflect his own interpretations of the subject matter, by 1932 his writings revealed that he had come to accept the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development as an artist and his impact of future generations of photographers. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did Weston write about?","completion":"Edward Weston wrote about many things, including his experiences and thoughts on photography, his concept of previsualization, and his own development as an artist.

John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king. Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp, and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John in control of the city of London, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive. At this point Walter of Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent by Richard to restore order.

Listen to native New Yorkers, online or in person, to get the subtle range of different accents.\\"","completion":"Title: The Art of Mastering the Classic Long Island Accent: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: The Long Island accent, known for its distinct character, is instantly recognizable and often imitated. Whether you're trying to learn the accent for a performance or just want to explore its depth and uniqueness, there are several key factors to bear in mind. Through proper techniques and practice, you can assimilate this iconic accent and make it your own. In this article, we delve into the aspects of speaking nasally, adjusting your speech rhythm, vocal blending, and using local colloquialisms to master the Long Island accent. 1. Embrace the nasal and constricted throat: One of the most crucial components of the Long Island accent is its distinct nasality. To achieve this, speak through your nose and narrow your throat, almost as if you are mimicking a congested individual. This will create a higher pitch and add resonance to your speech, which is essential for emulating the characteristic nasal tone of the regional accent. While practicing, ensure that the constricted throat doesn't compromise your vocal clarity. 2. Capture the \\"attitude\\" in your speech rhythm: The attitude and rhythm of the Long Island accent are heavily influenced by its East Coast roots. To recreate this distinct \\"swagger,\\" speed up your speech and emphasize natural contractions such as \\"gotta\\" instead of \\"got to\\" or \\"wanna\\" in place of \\"want to.\\" This will help to infuse your speech with the casual, confident demeanor that typifies the Long Island persona. 3. Blend words together and elongate vowels: Another essential aspect of the Long Island accent involves blending words and elongating vowels. By combining words together, you can create a fluid flow to your speech, simulating the rapid pace of a native New Yorker. At the same time, make sure to elongate vowel sounds, as this can give your rendition a distinguishable Long Island touch. Practice these techniques by reciting phrases and sentences that feature strong vowel sounds, such as \\"Let's go to the store for coffee.\\" 4. Engage in local colloquialisms: To truly personify the Long Island accent, incorporate popular colloquialisms and expressions used by locals. Use phrases like \\"Waiting on line\\" instead of \\"waiting in line\\" and \\"Lawn Guyland\\" for \\"Long Island.\\" These authentic expressions will add depth and credibility to your accent, taking it to the next level. 5. Listen to native New Yorkers: Finally, expose yourself to the various accents present within the region by listening to native New Yorkers. This can be achieved through watching movies or television shows set in the area, listening to podcasts recorded by locals, or even observing interactions in person if you live or visit the area. This will enable you to pick up on subtle nuances and variations within the dialect, fostering your understanding of the Long Island accent. Conclusion: Mastering the Long Island accent is a process that requires dedication, practice, and a keen ear for nuance. By focusing on maintaining a nasal tone, capturing the attitude in your speech rhythms, merging words, elongating vowels, engaging in local colloquialisms, and absorbing the subtleties of native speakers, you can gradually tune your speech patterns to resemble the iconic Long Island accent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Annelid In 2007 Torsten Struck and colleagues compared 3 genes in 81 taxa, of which 9 were outgroups, in other words not considered closely related to annelids but included to give an indication of where the organisms under study are placed on the larger tree of life. For a cross-check the study used an analysis of 11 genes (including the original 3) in 10 taxa. This analysis agreed that clitellates, pogonophorans and echiurans were on various branches of the polychaete family tree. It also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into Scolecida, Canalipalpata and Aciculata was useless, as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa. In addition, it also placed sipunculans, generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum, on another branch of the polychaete tree, and concluded that leeches were a sub-group of oligochaetes rather than their sister-group among the clitellates. Rouse accepted the analyses based on molecular phylogenetics, and their main conclusions are now the scientific consensus, although the details of the annelid family tree remain uncertain.

This first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and James Stewart to the screen. \\"The Far Country\\" is the only one out of all five Stewart-Mann westerns that is often overlooked. Stewart, yet again, puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five Stewart-Mann westerns. Jeff Webster (Stewart) is uncaring, always looking out for himself, which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. Ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. This displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick, Ben Tatum, played by Walter Brennan, since Tatum is the one that gave it to him. Mann, yet again, puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five Stewart-Mann westerns. He displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. The story is that Jeff and Ben, through a series of events, wind up in the get rich quick town of Dawson, along with gold partners Calvet and Flippen, and no-good but beautiful Roman and her hired men. They are unable to leave, because crooked sheriff Mr. Gannon (McIntire) and his \\"deputies\\" will hang them, since the only way out is through Skagway, which is Gannon's town. But, eventually, McIntire comes to them, but not to collect Stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. What is McIntire there for? He is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. People are killed. A sheriff for Dawson is considered needed, and Calvet elects Stewart because he is good with a gun. Stewart, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out. He also refuses it because he does not like to help people, since law and order always gets somebody killed. So, Flippen is elected instead. A miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of Gannon's men, a purely evil, mustachioed fancy gunman named Madden, who carries two guns, played by Wilke. Flippen attempts to arrest Madden and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk. A man named Yukon replaces Flippen. Stewart and Tatum start to pull out, but are ambushed by Gannon's men. Tatum is killed, and Stewart is wounded. Stewart finally realizes that he must do something, or Gannon will take over Dawson, set up his own rules, and it will become his town, just like Skagway. The audience also realizes what Stewart must do. Another thing that the audience realizes is that Stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and Gannon. If Stewart leaves, Gannon would take over the town. If Stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. This is where a great scene occurs. Stewart walks into his cabin. He has a sling on his arm. For a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, Stewart is in the background, just inside the door. He stares at it for a few seconds. He tosses the sling away. The sling lands on the back of a chair, and falls to the floor. This is symbolic, because he is throwing away his old life, which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. He comes into his new life, of helping people when they need help.

Question 2: What are crop circles? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will first conduct some research and gather relevant information on crop circles. Step 1: Research crop circles and their origins Crop circles are large patterns created by the flattening of crops, usually in fields of wheat, barley, or other grain. They have been appearing in fields around the world, most notably in England, since the 1970s. Many theories have been proposed to explain their formation, ranging from natural phenomena and man-made hoaxes to extraterrestrial activities. Question 1: Why did crop circles start appearing? Based on my research, crop circles started appearing due to various reasons such as: 1. Hoaxes: Many crop circles have been created by pranksters as a form of artistic expression or for amusement. Some of the most well-known hoaxers are Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, who confessed in 1991 that they had been creating crop circles in England since 1978. 2. Natural phenomena: Some scientists have suggested that crop circles could be the result of natural causes, such as wind vortices or whirlwinds. This theory, however, does not fully explain the complexity and precision of the patterns seen in many crop circles. 3. Unexplained phenomena: While many crop circles have been explained as hoaxes or natural events, some still remain unexplained, leading to speculation about extraterrestrial involvement or other mysterious forces. Question 2: What are crop circles? Crop circles are large, often intricate patterns created by the flattening of crops, usually in fields of wheat, barley, or other grain. These formations can appear overnight and have been reported in various locations around the world, with the majority occurring in England. Answering the question: Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, the questions are not asking the same thing.

The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod.

Given the background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. and the situation: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Answer the following question: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, it means that Sampline has more electron shells than Mardine. As the number of electron shells increases, the effect of electron shielding becomes more significant. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where inner electrons block the attractive force exerted by the nucleus on the outer electrons. In elements with more electron shells, the shielding effect is stronger because there are more electrons between the nucleus and the outer electrons. This leads to a decrease in effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons, resulting in a reduction of the electronegativity of the element as we go down a column in the periodic table. In conclusion, since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, its electron shielding is higher, and its electronegativity is lower."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Users Report Burning Temperatures Apple’s newly released iPad is proving to be one of the hottest items of the year, literally. Since the iPad’s release, Apple’s comment boards have become electrified with reports about the gadget overheating. One user said that the new iPad burned her thighs, leaving them red for 15 minutes. Another said his “new iPad 32 GB Wi-Fi had been getting hot enough to go into shutdown mode when using the NetFlix App after 30 minutes.” Consumer Reports weighed in, running a series of tests comparing Apple’s new iPad to the iPad 2. It found that it ran roughly 12 degrees hotter than its predecessor when gaming for 45 minutes, reaching a top temperature of 116 degrees Fahrenheit. Paul Reynolds, electronics editor at Consumer Reports, told ABC News, “We don’t consider these temperatures to be a real concern. … These are not the temperatures that are going to cause a burn, even for a fairly sustained period we think, it’s not likely. “This is not an unsafe device because of these temperatures,” he added. ”At most, you may have some discomfort. Depending on where you’re holding it, you may need to adjust your hands, but this is not going to be a safety hazard.” An Apple spokesperson told ABC News: “The new iPad delivers a stunning Retina display, A5X chip, support for 4G LTE plus 10 hours of battery life, all while operating well within our thermal specifications. If customers have any concerns, they should contact AppleCare.” ABC News has noticed warmer temperatures on the new iPad in the bottom corner when LTE is on and when playing processor-intensive games. We haven’t found it to be uncomfortable to use in our last four days of testing. Read our full review of the new iPad here.

Answer:","completion":"The question appears to have some confusion within it. Mount Everest is not in Sri Lanka; it is situated at the border between Nepal and China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The peak of Mount Everest is the highest point in the world, standing at a height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) as of 2020. However, I believe what you're asking may be about the first Sri Lankan to climb Mount Everest. That title goes to Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala. They were both part of the Everest Expedition in 2016 to represent Sri Lanka. Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala became the first Sri Lankan to reach the summit of Mount Everest on May 21, 2016. Before attempting to climb Everest, Jayanthi had been involved in mountaineering and adventure sports for many years. She summited Mount Imja Tse (Island Peak) in the Himalayas in 2012 and Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa in 2014. Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala, a human rights activist, and Johann Peries, a hairstylist, began their journey with a team of climbers and guides. They reached the summit by following a series of predetermined waypoints and climbing stages. Like all climbers, they faced technical challenges and altitude-related complications during the two-month expedition. During this expedition, Johann Peries faced some difficulties and had to turn back just a few hundred meters short of the summit. However, he continued his mountaineering pursuits and summited Mount Everest successfully on May 22, 2018, becoming the second Sri Lankan to do so. The achievements of these climbers have not only brought pride to Sri Lanka but have also inspired many others to push their boundaries in the field of mountaineering and adventure sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: California Reaches Beyond Its Borders With Rules, From Ethanol To Eggs Tharaldson Ethanol Plant No. 1: Blindsided by California global-warming regulations. Tharaldson Ethanol Plant No. 1 sits just west of Casselton, N.D., population 2,329, a gleaming collection of silver fermentation vats and grain-storage silos with capacity to produce 153 million gallons of alcohol a year. The 250 million plant was built with California’s strict fuel regulations in mind. It’s close to rail lines leading straight to the Golden State, and for the first two years of its existence, Tharaldson No. 1 sent 25% of its output to refineries operated by BP BP, Shell and Valero. “California was our whole business model,” says Ryan Thorpe, manager of the Tharaldson plant. “We’re on the Burlington Northern railroad. We’re a westward-facing plant.” Then California decided it didn’t like North Dakota ethanol. Under the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard that went into effect in 2010, Tharaldson was judged according to its “lifecyle” greenhouse-gas emissions and penalized for the high amount of coal burned in local power plants. California ethanol producers, who use electricity from gas and hydropower, had an edge. Tharaldson now sells less than 1% of its ethanol to California. Normally, the Constitution prohibits such shenanigans. Under the Interstate Commerce Clause, states aren’t allowed to erect barriers to the free flow of goods, and the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down state laws that give advantages to local producers of everything from milk to garbage. But so far, California seems to be getting a pass. A three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals approved the state’s ethanol regulations in September, and a month earlier the same court upheld a California law that prohibits the sale of foie gras from force-fed ducks (there’s no other kind). Out-of-state egg producers are fighting another law that bans the importation of eggs from hens that haven’t been kept in California-compliant cages (apparently, the state’s voters were disturbed by videos showing hens in cramped quarters). There’s no question states can ban products they think are unhealthy or dangerous. But it’s a stretch for California to effectively ban ethanol from the Midwest because the diesel burned in a farmer’s tractor in North Dakota contributes to the global warming that one day will threaten multimillion-dollar beach houses in Malibu. “You are allowed to regulate within your borders,” says Jonathan Adler, an expert on interstate commerce law at Case Western University Law School. Courts are supposed to distinguish between legitimate safety regulations and disguised trade barriers, however, “and California seems to be crossing that line.” California argues that since all ethanol is chemically identical, it has to look beyond the molecule to how it is produced in order to address the problem of global warming. To do that, it has a complex formula that accounts for everything from how far the grain fields are from the silo to how much fuel locomotives burn hauling the ethanol to California. Under that formula, Brazilian ethanol produced from sugar-cane waste scores better than Midwest ethanol from coal-burning states. “They’re not going to take my ethanol that’s only a few hundred miles away by train, but they’ll take it from thousands of miles away by ship,” Thorpe says. California also reached beyond its borders with the foie gras law, passed under stiff pressure from animal-rights activists alarmed by the centuries-old practice of force-feeding ducks for the 21 days before they are slaughtered in order to expand their livers. “Our point is pretty simple: You can’t induce a disease in an animal just to make it taste better,” says Carter Dillard, a lawyer for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, who says the ducks suffer progressive liver failure in the three weeks before they are killed. Foie gras producers in New York and Canada counter that they are selling a safe and federally-approved product that is still legal even in California. Unlike child pornography or machine guns, Californians can still ship all the foie gras into the state they want. The law just prohibits California businesses – read: expensive restaurants – from selling it to consumers. Even the California Food and Agriculture Dept. found the procedure isn’t cruel and urged then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to veto the bill (he didn’t). “What is the legitimate local interest here?” asks Michael Tenenbaum, a Santa Monica lawyer who is pressing the Ninth Circuit to rehear a challenge to the foie gras law. “California doesn’t have a legitimate interest in getting New York farmers to change their methods.” California voters, again outraged by undercover videos, passed Proposition 2 in 2008 requiring veal calves, hens and pregnant pigs to be raised in cages or pens large enough for the animals to “lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs and turn around freely.” Fair enough: Californians are entitled to tell their farmers how to raise animals within state borders. Summary:","completion":"California has enacted strict fuel regulations, with regulations such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, affecting out-of-state ethanol producers like Tharaldson Ethanol Plant No. 1 in North Dakota. The plant was built for the California market and initially sent 25% of its output to the state; however, California's fuel standards have reduced sales to California to less than 1% of Tharaldson's total output. While the US Constitution prohibits states from creating such trade barriers, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals approved California's ethanol regulations in September, sparking debate on the legitimacy of these actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games. - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\" - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created.

Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found. Getting the intranet (no Internet is available) to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they discover a vent that allows them to navigate to different rooms that... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Bad Kids Go to Hell,\\" the character Jacob Rainwater is not killed by the students or anyone else during the course of the film. Jacob, an Apache Native American, owned the land on which Crestview Academy was later built. His land was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, and it was then taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. The students believe that the library is haunted, possibly due to the history of the land and its connection to Jacob Rainwater. The deaths that occur during the movie are a result of accidents, misunderstandings, or self-inflicted injuries among the students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: The fresh allegations follow several made by actresses in the US against Weinstein - four of rape and more than 30 of sexual harassment - and come as the organisation behind the Oscars expelled Weinstein. Bafta had already suspended the producer and on Tuesday Weinstein's wife, British designer Georgina Chapman, said she was leaving him. Actress Anthony, 54, told The Sunday Times she met the producer when she starred in 1982 sci-fi film Krull and the alleged assault occurred a few years later. She said it was a \\"pathetic, revolting\\" attack that had left her \\"disgusted and embarrassed\\". On Wednesday, Anthony tweeted that she had just reported a historical crime, adding \\"feel sick... so sad\\". Fellow British star Kate Winslet also spoke of her recollections of Weinstein, saying it was \\"absolutely deliberate\\" that she did not thank the director when she won her best actress Oscar, despite the fact his company financed and distributed the film. Winslet, who won the Academy Award in 2009 for The Reader - in which she played a woman hiding her past as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp - thanked 19 people by name but deliberately excluded Weinstein. ||||| Many were young, powerless and afraid to speak out in case their careers were ruined. For nearly three decades their accusations remained bottled up, some suppressed by pay-offs. More than 30 women have now come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the man once described as 'God' of the film industry. The accusations, including from some of the world's most famous actresses, range from inappropriate massages to rape. Here is a list of those who have come forward so far. Kate Beckinsale In an Instagram post the Underworld star said Weinstein made a move on her when she was just 17. 'When I arrived reception told me to go to his room. He opened the door in his bathrobe. I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him. After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed. A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting.I realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not.' Teen assault: Kate Beckinsale says Weinstein tried to ply her with alcohol and met her in his bathrobe when she was just 17 Gwyneth Paltrow The star said that when she was 22, Weinstein touched her and suggested having joint massages in a hotel bedroom before she started shooting the 1996 Jane Austen adaptation Emma. She told the New York Times: 'I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified'. Paltrow (pictured with Weinstein in 2002) told the New York Times that when she was 22 Weinstein touched her and suggested having joint massages in the bedroom She said she told her then boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident and he confronted the mogul. She said Weinstein then told her not to tell anyone and she feared getting fired. Gwyneth Paltrow, 45, is an American actress, singer, and food writer who made her name starring in Seven (1995) and Emma (1996). Angelina Jolie The actress told the New York Times she had to turn down advances from Weinstein in 1998 and chose never to work with him again. She said she warned other women about him. She said: 'I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.' Angelina Jolie, 42, is cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. She made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Jolie (pictured speaking ahead of a screening of her new film In the Land of Blood and Honey) told the New York Times she had to turn down advances from Weinstein in 1998 Cara Delevigne The model wrote on her Instagram page about a meeting with Weinstein in which he 'asked her to kiss another woman.' She wrote: 'As soon as we were alone he began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers and spoke about other inappropriate things of a sexual nature. He then invited me to his room. I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room. 'At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn't want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....i thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....i was so nervous. After singing I said again that I had to leave.He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room'. Cara Delevigne, 25, is an English fashion model and actress. She signed with Storm Model Management after leaving school in 2009. Eva Green Green's mother says Weinstein sexually harassed her during a meeting at his suite in Paris. The Bond Girl, 37, managed to escape however after being summoned to the movie mogul's hotel room, her mother Marlene Jobert said in a radio interview on Friday. 'He operated with her the exact same way he acted with all the others, under the pretext of a professional meeting, of a script that had to get to her with a nice part into the bargain,' said Jobert. 'Since his office was also in his hotel suite, she [Eva] followed him, and the exact same thing happened to her as to the others. She managed to escape, but he threatened to destroy her professionally.' Jobert added: '[It was] the usual scenario, the same pattern he used for all the other victims.' Weinstein allegedly harassed French actress Eva Green in his suite in Paris Lea Seydoux The French actress accused the mogul of jumping on her and trying to kiss her. She wrote in The Guardian: 'We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. He tried more than once. This was never going to be about work. He had other intentions – I could see that very clearly. All throughout the evening, he flirted and stared at me as if I was a piece of meat. The French actress (pictured in Spectre) accused the mogul of jumping on her and trying to kiss her 'It was hard to say no because he’s so powerful. I’m an actress and he’s a producer. We are in the same industry, so its impossible to avoid him. I’ve seen how he operates: the way he looks for an opening. The way he tests women to see what he can get away with. That’s the most disgusting thing. Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It's unbelievable that he’s been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career.' Lea Seydoux, 35, starred in Bond film Spectre and was nominated for the César Award for Best Actress for her role as a lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette in the film Farewell, My Queen (2012). Minka Kelly The Friday Night Lights star said she met Weinstein at an event and soon after was asked by her agent if she would be willing to meet him at his hotel room to discuss her career. Kelly said that she agreed to the meeting but refused to go to Weinstein's room, and instead met him at the restaurant inside his hotel with an assistant. 'He bulls*** me for 5 minutes re: movies he could put me in, then asked the assistant to excuse us,' said Weinstein. 'As she walked away, he said, \\"I know you were feeling what I was feeling when we met the other night” and then regaled me with offers of a lavish life filled with trips around the world on private planes etc. 'IF I would be his girlfriend.' Kelly posted a photo of a cross stitch alongside her post that read: 'Boys will be Boys.' The second 'boys' was crossed out at the bottom however, and stitched in was 'held accountable for their f***ing actions.'

I was so surprised and shocked I couldn’t stop laughing because it was so awkward.' She said he could then feel him getting an erection. 'It was implied that if I did not comply with doing what he asked me to do that I would not get the role that I had already been informally offered,' she added. 'I laughed in his face as I was in shock and so uncomfortable. I left the party right after that.' After denying his advances, Subkoff claims she was stripped of the part.

'I remember him telling me all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them.' I wasn't drinking the cool aid [sic], I knew Harvey was a master manipulator. 'He also announced to me at the last dinner I had with him at Dominic's that his pilot knew to be on standby because he could never get me to sleep with him, to which I did what I always did, make light of the situation, a joke here or there and moved on.'

When the topic turned to whether her breasts looked real, Mr. Weinstein lunged forward and grabbed them. She protested and pushed his hands away, but Mr. Weinstein was persistent, putting his hand up her skirt and asking to kiss her, the police report says. Ms. Battilana reported the encounter to police within hours of leaving Mr. Weinstein’s office, and quickly detectives from the Special Victims Unit were brought into the investigation. The model was going over the details of her allegation with them when her phone rang. It was Mr. Weinstein, asking to meet her for a drink, and the investigators seized the moment, whispering to her to accept an invitation to see him the following night at the bar of the TriBeCa Grand Hotel. They would fit her with a recording device. Mr. Weinstein showed up at the bar the next night seemingly eager for a reunion, according to the audio recording. He had no idea that the TriBeCa Grand, which has since been renamed the Roxy Hotel, was swarming with undercover detectives. Mr. Weinstein invited her up to his room, saying he needed to take a shower, the police said. Ms. Battilana went upstairs, but refused to enter the room. In a tense exchange in the hallway, she asked him why he had touched her breasts the day before. As his tone grew belligerent, a detective, concerned for Ms. Battilana’s safety, intervened. Pretending to be a reporter from TMZ, he loudly badgered Mr. Weinstein for an interview, causing enough of a scene for Mr. Weinstein to retreat from the hallway, investigators said. Once they were back downstairs, Ms. Battilana slipped out a side door, and Mr. Weinstein was once again confronted by a detective. This time, the detective made it known he was from law enforcement, and that the police wanted to talk to him.

I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before.

Article: The man who invented Coca-Cola was not a native Atlanta, but on the day of his funeral every drugstore in town shut up the shop in honor of him. He was John Styth Pemberton, born in 1833 in Knoxville, Georgia, eighty miles away. Pemberton was a chemist, sometimes known as Doctor, who, during the Civil War, became an officer and led a cavalry troop. He settled in Atlanta in 1869, and soon began making such patent medicines as Triplex Liver Pills and Globe of Flower Cough Syrup. In 1885, he registered a trademark for something called French Wine Coca-Ideal Nerve and Tonic Stimulant. A few months later, he formed the Pemberton Chemical Company, and hired an accountant named Frank M. Robinson, who had not only a good head for figures, but, attached to it, so unique a nose that he could judge the ingredients of a batch of syrup merely by sniffing it. In 1886 --- a year in which, as contemporary Coca-Cola officials like to point out, the English writer Conan Doyle made Sherlock Holmes known publicly and France found the truth about the Statue of Liberty --- Pemberton invented a syrup that he called Coca-Cola. It was a change of his French Wine Coca. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and, when the end product tasted awful, had thrown in some cola nut oil and a few other oils, mixing the mixture in a three-legged iron pot in his back yard and swishing it around with an oar. He distributed it to soda fountains in used beer bottles, and Robinson, with his elegant account's script, instantly designed a label, on which \\"Coca-Cola\\" was written in the style which is still employed. Pemberton looked upon his mixture less as a drink than as a headache cure. One morning in 1886, a man suffering from a headache dragged himself into an Atlanta drugstore and asked for a bottle of Coca-Cola. According to usual practice, druggists should pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of water, but at that time, the man on duty was too lazy to walk to the fresh-water tap. Instead, he mixed the syrup with some soda... Question: How did Pemberton change French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious? - He mixed it with several oils instead of water. - He put some beer into the mixture. - He added more coffee into the mixture than before. - He added some cola nut oil and a few other oils. Answer:","completion":"Pemberton changed the French Wine Coca formula to make it taste delicious by adding some cola nut oil and a few other oils to the mixture. He had taken out the wine and added a bit of caffeine, and when the end product tasted awful, he threw in the mentioned oils, which improved the taste of the concoction that would eventually become Coca-Cola."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Article:","completion":"Title: Facebook Faces Criticism Over Anti-Semitic Ads and Promises More Human Oversight Facebook is once again finding itself in hot water, this time over claims that it allowed anti-Semitic ads to be shown to users who posted hate speech online. The social media giant has come under fire in the past for the role its ads played in the US presidential election, and now a recent report from ProPublica has revealed that Facebook's algorithm-generated ad system allowed advertisers to target profiles with references to \\"Jew hater\\" and \\"How to burn Jews\\". In response to the controversy, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg announced on Wednesday that the company would add \\"more human review and oversight\\" to prevent its automated processes from being misused. Sandberg stated in a Facebook post, \\"The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.\\" As a Jewish woman herself, Sandberg expressed her frustration over the deeply offensive terms that were written in the education and employer fields on Facebook profiles. These fields are used to help advertisers target specific audiences, and while they were missed initially because they \\"were used so infrequently,\\" Sandberg confirmed that they have since been deleted. Going forward, Sandberg said that Facebook is working on a program that will allow users to report potential ad abuses. The news was welcomed by Ad Age, which reported on the developments. By addressing the issue head-on and pledging to implement human oversight and user control, Facebook aims to demonstrate its commitment to preventing future ad controversies.

The premise suggests that information sharing and coordination between these groups is not only a key practice but also an essential component of their overall mission. Given the premise, we can analyze the hypothesis: \\"The groups are not allowed to share information with anyone.\\" To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or contradicts it, we must examine both the content and implications of each statement. The hypothesis claims that these organizations are not permitted to share information with any external entity or individual. This statement is in direct contradiction with the premise, which underlines the importance of information sharing and coordination between the various groups as a central aspect of their objective. Considering the roles of these organizations as described in the premise, it is evident that their activities revolve around the dissemination of information concerning threats and vulnerabilities. This involves the sharing of information between different groups, both public and private, to create a more robust and integrated system of threat detection, prevention, and response. Additionally, the premise highlights the cross-sector and international collaboration these organizations are engaged in, demonstrating that they are sharing information not only within the confines of a particular industry or nation, but across multiple sectors and geographical borders. Moreover, the premise implies a sense of trust and collaboration between these organizations, as they work together to identify and counter potential threats to infrastructure and security. By sharing information, they can pool their resources and expertise, better understand the nature of threats, and develop effective countermeasures and strategies to protect public and private entities alike. In conclusion, the premise shows a landscape where organizations are engaged in sharing information and coordinating with each other on various levels to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities effectively. This involvement directly contradicts the hypothesis that \\"the groups are not allowed to share information with anyone.\\" Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be true or entailed by the premise, as it is inconsistent with the key activities and objectives of the organizations mentioned in the premise. Instead, the premise reveals that information sharing amongst these groups is vital for their mission and the overall security of infrastructure and nations, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts and communication channels."},{"prompt":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does the mls schedule work Suggested answer: The league's closed membership makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues not using promotion and relegation .

By road it is 450 kilometres (280 mi) south-east of London, 287 kilometres (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 kilometres (190 mi) south-west of Brussels, 774 kilometres (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 kilometres (239 mi) north-east of Nantes, and 135 kilometres (84 mi) south-east of Rouen. Paris is located in the north-bending arc of the river Seine and includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream of the city, established around 7600 BC. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river. Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).

To help you validate the correct answer, let's break down the question into two main categories: countries with nuclear weapons and countries with nuclear power reactors for civilian use. 1. Countries with nuclear weapons: As of 2022, there are nine countries known to possess nuclear weapons. These countries are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. These nations are either officially recognized as nuclear-weapon states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or are known to possess nuclear weapons outside of the treaty's framework. 2. Countries with nuclear power reactors for civilian use: While there are nine countries with nuclear weapons, several more countries have nuclear power reactors for civilian purposes, such as generating electricity. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as of January 2022, there are 31 countries operating nuclear power reactors.

Summarize this article in one sentence. amusing tale or skits for your comic. Come up with a joke you want to share with the world. Scribbling down some basic dialogue for your characters may be helpful. Make use of subjects that interest you and what you find funny, then try to fit it into your own sense of humor. A lot of literary work comes from personal experience. Your past may be rich with stories you can tell. You can also put yourself in new situations to get more inspiration. For example, Bill Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes is about a boy and his stuffed tiger. Scott Adams’s Dilbert lampoons office culture. Ask yourself what age group your comic is meant for. Complicated jokes are more appropriate for teens and adults, for instance. Tone down the joke if you’re writing for children. Before setting pencil to paper, make a final decision about your comic’s subject matter. This is very important since it determines how you design the rest of your comic. Select a scenario that is easy for you to imagine. It may not seem laugh out loud hilarious yet, but it can be a good starting point. Even ideas that seem insignificant at first can turn out to be very funny. For example, imagine drawing a child pretending to be Superman. You can take this concept in many different directions. Once you have settled on the story you want to tell, think of who you need in the comic to tell it. Most short comics involve a limited number of characters, usually less than 3 or 4 at a time. The comic’s story can be driven by the personalities of a few characters and how they interact. You do not need to have multiple characters. For instance, picture a child blowing bubble gum until it pops all over her. Her actions and reaction, driven by her personality, create the humor. If your comic is short, having a lot of characters can be overwhelming and obscure the writing. Keep your comic simple so it stays funny. Ask yourself what your characters are doing. You should have a basic idea of this from brainstorming funny ideas earlier. Expand on your idea before beginning to draw. Any characters you use should contribute to the joke presented in your comic. This may help you come up with more amusing situations or dialogue. Take into account the character’s personality. Keep their actions true to their character. The reason doesn’t have to be complex, but it does keep the humor cohesive. For example, a child may dress up as a Superhero because superheroes are fun and they want to fly. The setting may be a very important part of your joke. If this is the case, you will need to draw the setting into your panel. Close your eyes and try to imagine your characters in the location you chose. You should be able to see the background and any important plot details you need to draw in. If your character visits a zoo, for example, plan on drawing cages, animals, and possibly walkways and other scenery. If your comic can take place anywhere, having a specific setting isn’t necessary. Many black and white comics use a white background. Color comics keep the background an unobtrusive color like blue. Think about when your comic takes place. The time of day, season, or year may not make a difference in some situations. For others, it can be very important. Many comics are funny because they address present-day issues that readers relate to. Also, your choice of time period can affect your comic’s background. For instance, a comic set in autumn looks different than one set in summer. Instead of a bright, radiant sun, you may end up drawing piles of leaves. For example, Hagar the Horrible is about a viking. The setting is the Middle Ages, so you won’t see cars, vending machines, skyscrapers, or computers laying around. Most funny stories can be told within 3 or 4 individual panels. Each panel gives you space to tell a part of the joke. The first panel sets up a situation, the second panel shows what happens, and the last panel explains what happens, completing the joke. Many short comics have a 3-act structure, similar to lots of books and plays. Having a beginning, middle, and end is a simple, classic way to arrange comics. Not all comics are in this format. Many good comics are 1 panel, such as those printed in magazines like The New Yorker and Women’s World. Comics can also be much longer than 4 panels. Summary:","completion":"This article discusses the process of creating a comic, including developing a joke, selecting the subject matter, designing the characters and setting, and determining the comic's length and format."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A teenager who put a man through two months of torment by falsely accusing him of rape has been spared jail. Sophie Hooper, 19, told police she had been forced to have sex against her will with a man she had only just met in the pub. But two months later her conscience got the better of her and she wrote a letter to the police confessing she had lied about the allegations. Hooper had claimed she went with the unnamed man to his home where he held her down by the neck on his bed and raped her. After she called police, who came out in the middle of the night, the man was arrested and held in custody for more than seven hours. Sophie Hooper, 19, told police she had been raped but two months later confessed that she had lied. She escaped a jail sentence at Southampton Crown Court today. Victims and alleged victims of rape have been granted anonymity since 1976 to spare women from humiliation and encourage more victims to report attacks.The law originally gave the same protection to those charged with rape.But anonymity for defendants was withdrawn in 1988 after judges protested that it prevented police from appealing for witnesses.Judges also said that the acquittal of a man charged with rape was enough to clear his name and reputation.Maura McGowan, a deputy High Court judge and chief of the professional body for barristers, recently called for the identities of men accused of rape and other sex crimes to be kept secret unless they are found guilty in court.The leading lawyer said the names of those charged with sex offences should not be released because the crimes carry 'such a stigma’. But John Cooper, a human rights barrister, disagreed with this and said anonymity for people accused of sex crimes is 'unworkable'. But there was no truth in Hooper's. allegations. She didn't admit this for over two months, before she eventually told police she was lying. Southampton Crown Court heard how police began investigating and found inconsistencies with her version of events. Hooper accused the man of raping her in June 2011 but by August that year officers told him he wouldn't face prosecution. ]A. short time later police received a letter from Hooper, who has just. become a mum, in which she said 'maybe calling it rape was wrong'. The teenager from Eastleigh, Hampshire, was later arrested in September 2011 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. But it wasn't until January 2012 that 'she fully accepted the lies she had told' said prosecutor Carolyn Branford-Wood.Hooper. revealed how, in fact, the pair had gone to his home from the pub,. began kissing and the sex 'just happened', adding she didn't say yes or. no. When she left his home she returned to the pub run by friends of her family who told her she had been raped and to call 999. In. court Hooper apologised by saying 'I shouldn't have lied, I am sorry' and added that if she could turn the clock back she would. The. court was told how the man described in a victim impact statement. feeling 'sick to the stomach' and anxious following the accusation. He was also unable to go out because, even though he knew he was innocent, he felt he would be tarred. He said he could not sleep properly and resorted to taking anti-depressants. Mitigating. for Hooper, Fern Russell said it was not a sophisticated plot - she was. in a state and made a bad decision out of stupidity rather than malice. Recorder Stuart Jones QC handed the teenager an eight-month prison term suspended for two years. He told her she was lucky not to have gone to jail for what the court deems a very serious offence. Crying wolf: Sophie Hooper, 19, appeared at Southampton Crown Court yesterday. Mr Jones said: 'The consequences for the man accused must have been traumatic in the extreme.' He added that Hooper had just come out of a difficult period of adolescence and her mental health was far from robust. The teenager was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

This article: Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines, 2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011. Its double name has been said to make it \\"distinctive, if not unique\\".

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Victor Jara was born in 1932 in Lonquen, near Santiago, to two peasants, Manuel Jara and Amanda Martinez. His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. After joining the choir at the University of Chile in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent. He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life. In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called penas to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumen, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music. He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda. In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pena de Los Parra, owned by Angel Parra. Through these activities, he became involved in the Nueva Cancion movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, Canto a lo humano, in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \\"Plegaria a un Labrador\\" (\\"Prayer to a Worker\\") and \\"Te Recuerdo Amanda\\" (\\"I Remember You Amanda\\"). What plays?","completion":"Victor Jara appeared in several plays with social themes at the University of Chile.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What work's entrance chorus fit the situation almost exactly? \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is the best known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted.
