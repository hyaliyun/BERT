PA cdot PB cdot PC leq 2R^3 2. PA + PB + PC leq 4R. We will address each part separately. Part (1) 1. Let's place point P on the arc overparen{BC}, and denote angle PBC = theta. 2. Using the known trigonometric identity for side lengths in terms of the circumradius R, we have: [ PA = 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) ] [ PB = 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) ] [ PC = 2R sin theta ] 3. To find PA cdot PB cdot PC, we multiply these lengths: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC = left( 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) right) cdot left( 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) right) cdot left( 2R sin theta right) ] 4. Simplifying the expression: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC = 4R^2 sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) cdot 2R sin theta ] 5. Using the product-to-sum identity: [ sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) = frac{1}{2} left[ cos left( 2theta right) - cos left( frac{2pi}{3} right) right] ] 6. Thus, the expression becomes: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC = 4R^2 cdot frac{1}{2} left( cos 2theta - cos frac{2pi}{3} right) cdot 2R sin theta ] 7. Recall that cos frac{2pi}{3} = -frac{1}{2}, so: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC = 4R^3 left( cos 2theta + frac{1}{2} right) sin theta ] 8. It’s known that the maximum value of the expression left( cos 2theta + frac{1}{2} right) leq 1 due to trigonometric limits. Therefore: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC leq 4R^3 cdot 0.5 = 2R^3 ] 9. The equality holds when theta = frac{pi}{6} (i.e., cos 2 times frac{pi}{6} = cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2}). Hence, we have shown: [ PA cdot PB cdot PC leq 2R^3 ] Part (2) 1. Let's express the sum PA + PB + PC again in terms of theta: [ PA + PB + PC = 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + 2R sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) + 2R sin theta ] 2. Using the trigonometric sum-to-product identities, we have: [ PA + PB + PC = 2R left( sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) right) + 2R sin theta ] 3. The sum sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) can be expressed using the identity sin A + sin B = 2 sin left( frac{A + B}{2} right) cos left( frac{A - B}{2} right): [ sin left( frac{pi}{3} + theta right) + sin left( frac{pi}{3} - theta right) = 2 sin left( frac{pi}{3} right) cos theta ] 4. Therefore: [ PA + PB + PC = 2R cdot 2 sin frac{pi}{3} cos theta + 2R sin theta ] 5. Using sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} we get: [ PA + PB + PC = 4R cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos theta + 2R sin theta ] [ = 2R sqrt{3} cos theta + 2R sin theta ] 6. We could rewrite it further in a sum form: [ PA + PB + PC = 2R (sqrt{3} cos theta + sin theta) ] 7. Utilize the cosine addition identity to simplify the expression: [ cos left( theta - frac{pi}{6} right) = cos theta cos frac{pi}{6} + sin theta sin frac{pi}{6} ] Since cos frac{pi}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} and sin frac{pi}{6} = frac{1}{2}: [ cos left( theta - frac{pi}{6} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos theta + frac{1}{2} sin theta ] 8.

A measure (mu) is called atomic if every measurable set of positive (mu)measure contains an atom. A measure (mu) is called nonatomic if there are no (mu)atoms. Provide examples of atomic, nonatomic, diffuse measures, and an example of a measure that is both atomic and diffuse. Show that the sum of an atomic measure and a nonatomic measure can be atomic.","completion":"1. **Identifying Diffuse and Non-Atomic Measures:** The Lebesgue measure (lambda) on ((mathbb{R}, mathscr{B}(mathbb{R}))) is known as both diffuse and non-atomic. Diffuse means the measure assigns a positive measure only to sets of infinite cardinality. Non-atomic means there are no atoms, i.e., for any measurable set (A) with (lambda(A) > 0), there exists a subset (B subseteq A) such that (0 < lambda(B) < lambda(A)). 2. **Identifying Atomic Measures:** Consider a measure (mu) on ((mathbb{R}, mathscr{B}(mathbb{R}))) defined by: mu(B) = I([0,1] subseteq B) quad text{for } B in mathscr{B}(mathbb{R}) This measure is atomic with the interval ([0,1]) being the (mu)-atom. The measure (mu) assigns a measure of 1 to any set that includes ([0,1]) and 0 otherwise. This is a combination of both atomic and diffuse properties: - It is atomic because ([0,1]) is an indivisible set with positive measure. - It is diffuse in the sense that outside [0,1] it does not contribute to the measure. 3. **Combining Atomic and Non-Atomic Measures to Get an Atomic Measure:** **Note:** It is established that each finite measure (mu) can be decomposed into a sum of an atomic measure (mu_a) and a non-atomic measure (mu_c). This explanation includes the measure decomposition, where: mu = mu_a + mu_c Let's use the example of the sum of two measures, specifically the Lebesgue measure (lambda) (non-atomic) and a counting measure (nu) (atomic). 4. **Constructing the Sum:** Let (nu) be a counting measure that assigns a measure (1) to each singleton, i.e., (nu({x}) = 1) for any (x in mathbb{R}). Then consider a measure (eta) defined by: eta = lambda + nu 5. **Verifying the Properties:** - **Atomic:** Every individual point can be considered as an atom under (nu), because (nu({x}) = 1). - **Non-Atomic:** The Lebesgue measure (lambda) ensures that between any points, there is a continuous distribution with no individual atoms. 6. **Conclusion:** The measure (eta) is an example of a measure that is the sum of an atomic measure and a non-atomic measure, and such a sum may still be atomic because it includes the counting measure component which has atoms.

Each pair of points can be connected by a line segment. The total number of line segments is given by: [ binom{2n}{2} = frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = n(2n-1) ] 2. **Hypothesis**: Suppose out of these (n(2n-1)) segments, we color (n^2+1) of them red. We need to show that at least (n) triangles with all sides red (red triangles) exist. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**: - Assume that there is no red triangle. - Focus on a point (A). Let the number of red segments from (A) be denoted by (d(A)). - Without loss of generality, suppose (d(A)) is maximum among all points. 4. **Vertex Degree**: - Let (A B_1, A B_2, ldots, A B_k) be the red segments originating from (A). Here (k geq n+1) because if each point is connected to at least (n+1) others, it's bound to create multiple red triangles unless we assume above. 5. **Two Case Analysis**: - **Case 1**: If any two of (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k) are connected by a red segment, let's say (B_1 B_2), then (triangle A B_1 B_2) forms a red triangle, contradicting our assumption. - **Case 2**: Suppose no red line segments exist between (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k). Then from each point (B_i (i=1,2, ldots, k)), there are at most (2n-k) red segments because the maximum possibilities for such pair-connections are diminished by their absence between them. - The total maximum number of red segments, in this case, would be bound by: [ sum_{i=1}^k d(B_i) leq k(2n-k) ] Taking (k geq n+1), we have: [ k(2n-k) leq n^2 ] But we know there are (n^2 + 1) red segments, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, case 2 is impossible. 6. **Existence of Red Triangles**: - At least one red triangle must exist considering more of (k) if not more connecting between those points (B_i). 7. **Proof by Induction**: - **Base Case (n = 2)**: - Assume four points (A, B, C, D). If we are to color 5 red out of these 6 possible segments and excluding only one, then it forces creating at least two red triangles by Pigeonhole principle. - **Inductive Step**: - Assume the hypothesis is true for (n = k): i.e., (2k) points form at least (k) red triangles. - For (n = k+1), (2k+2) points where red segments sum up ((k+1)^2 + 1): - Given connections (d(B), ldots, d(C)) again repeating the counting principle shows: (triangle ABC) red must include inherently if not, surpassing (3k+5) for contradiction re-evaluates maintaining at least (k+1) triangles. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, by the process connected, we see at least (n)-red triangles exist for assumed conditions as (n=k+1) holds true reflecting inductive step completion confirming the general hypothesis is valid.

Given the relationship frac{AB}{AD}=frac{CB}{CD}, we can rearrange it to: [ AB cdot CD = AD cdot CB ] 2. By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, known as Ptolemy’s Theorem, we have: [ AC cdot BD = AB cdot CD + AD cdot CB ] 3. Consider that E is the midpoint of AC, we split AC into equal segments, so AE = EC.

The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), gives the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve. Since f'(x) = e^x, the slope of the tangent at (t, e^t) is e^t. The equation of the tangent line at this point can be written as: [ y - e^t = e^t(x - t) ] Simplifying this, we get: [ y = e^t x + (1 - t)e^t quad text{(1)} ] 2. **Finding the Tangent Line to g(x) = ln x + 2:** The derivative of g(x), denoted as g'(x), is frac{1}{x}. For the line to be a common tangent, its slope must equal the slope of the tangent to f(x) at (t, e^t), which is e^t. Therefore, we set g'(x) = e^t and solve for x: [ frac{1}{x} = e^t implies x = e^{-t} ] Substituting x = e^{-t} into g(x) gives: [ g(e^{-t}) = ln(e^{-t}) + 2 = 2 - t ] For the lines to be identical, their slopes and y-intercepts must match. Therefore, we equate the slope and intercept from (1) with those of the tangent to g(x), leading to: [ frac{2 - t - e^t}{e^{-t} - t} = e^t ] Simplifying, we find: [ 1 - t = (1 - t)e^t ] This equation gives us two possible values for t: t = 0 or t = 1. However, if t = 1, the condition b > 0 is not satisfied as it leads to b = 0. Therefore, we discard t = 1. 3. **Determining the Value of a + b:** With t = 0, we substitute back into the equation of the tangent line to get: [ y - 1 = 1 cdot (x - 0) implies y = x + 1 ] Here, a = 1 and b = 1, so the sum a + b = 1 + 1 = 2.

Let's explore what happens if we have fewer than 8 liars. 4. **Contradiction and Minimum Liars:** - If there are fewer than 8 liars, at least one group of 8 individuals would be composed entirely of truth-tellers. - If all members of a group are truth-tellers, then their statement (that neighbors are from both parties) must be true. But since this cannot happen (all neighbors can't be from both parties), we reach a contradiction. - Therefore, the number of liars must be at least 8. 5. **Feasibility at 8 Liars:** - We will consider arranging exactly 8 liars in such a way to satisfy the problem's requirements. - Place one liar in each row ensuring that every liar's neighbors include at least one truth-teller. For example, the seating arrangement can be depicted as follows (L denotes liar and T denotes truth-teller), with Ls distributed in each row: \`\`\` Row 1: L T T T T T T T Row 2: T T T L T T T T Row 3: T T T T T L T T Row 4: T T T T T T T L \`\`\` Here each row has exactly one liar, and each liar is surrounded by truth-tellers guaranteeing the truthful members have mixed neighbors and thereby satisfying the problem's requirements.

Substituting these values into the equation for cos θ, we get: cos θ = frac {1}{3} cdot frac {sqrt {2}}{2} - frac {2sqrt {2}}{3} cdot frac {sqrt {2}}{2} = frac {sqrt {2}}{6} - frac {2}{3} = - frac {7}{6sqrt {2}} Then, find sin^2 θ: sin^2 θ = 1 - cos^2 θ = 1 - (-frac {7}{6sqrt {2}})^2 = 1 - frac {49}{72} = frac {23}{72} So, sin θ = pm sqrt {frac {23}{72}}.

We are required to argue that at least one more domino can be placed on the board. 2. **Partition the chessboard** Divide the 6 times 6 chessboard into 4 smaller 3 times 3 subboards.

Then diagonally opposite squares 2, 4, 6, and 8 cannot all be empty simultaneously because their paired domino covers will also be placed. 7. **Consequence of 9 being empty** Since placing a domino horizontally or vertically from 9 covers two squares of those numbered 1 to 8, it results in covered squares such that at most three squares can remain uncovered in the 3 times 3 grid. This leads to a contradiction since we need uncovered spaces to be greater than 4. 8. **Case 2 - Center square (9) is covered** If 9 is covered, the domino covering 9 must also cover one adjacent square. This placement splits into two subcases: - If the domino covers squares 8 and 9 (or equivalently squares 2 and 9), then at least four of the other squares 1, 3, 5, 7, must be uncovered. Consequently, squares indexed as 2, possibly another set 4, 6 remains uncovered, which allows for at least 1, 2 as openings. - Alternatively, if the domino covers squares 6 and 9 (or equivalently squares 4 and 9), the same analysis applies.

Now, if ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) intersect at point ( X ), this means through ( X ), there are two different lines ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) that are both parallel to ( l ). 5. However, from the Euclidean geometry, through any given point, there can be only one line parallel to another given line. This contradiction implies that ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) cannot intersect at any point ( X ) unless they are the same line. Thus, ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) must be parallel to each other. Hence, if two lines are parallel to a third line, they are parallel to each other. Second Variant: Consider three lines ( l ), ( m_{1} ), and ( m_{2} ). Let line ( l ) be parallel to ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ). We intersect all three lines with another line ( n ) and denote intersecting angles as shown in the diagram (typically marked in the solution). 1. Suppose line ( n ) intersects ( l ), ( m_{1} ), and ( m_{2} ), forming angles (alpha), (beta), and (gamma) respectively. 2. Because ( l parallel m_{1} ), alternate interior angles formed are equal, so ( alpha = gamma ). 3. Similarly, because ( l parallel m_{2} ), alternate interior angles formed are equal, so ( alpha = beta ). 4. Since ( alpha = gamma ) and ( alpha = beta ), it follows that (beta = gamma). 5. By definition of parallel lines, if the corresponding angles are equal, the lines must be parallel. Therefore, lines ( m_{1} ) and ( m_{2} ) are parallel due to (beta = gamma). This verifies that two lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each other.

To prove: this polynomial cannot be factored into two polynomials with integer coefficients. 1. **Analyze the given condition**: - Since ( b d + c d ) is odd, rewrite it as ( (b + c) d ). - Therefore, ( (b + c) d ) must be odd. - For the product of two numbers to be odd, both ( b + c ) and ( d ) must be odd. 2. **Implications on ( b ) and ( c )**: - Given that both ( b + c ) is odd and ( d ) is odd. - The sum ( b + c ) is odd, which implies one of ( b ) and ( c ) must be odd and the other must be even. - Thus, without loss of generality, assume ( b ) is odd and ( c ) is even (or vice versa). 3. **Assumption of factorization**: - Assume ( varphi(x) ) can be factored into the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients. One factor must be a linear polynomial because the leading term is ( x^3 ), and the coefficient is 1. - Denote the factorization as ( varphi(x) = (x + p)(x^2 + qx + r) ). - Where ( p ), ( q ), and ( r ) are integers. 4. **Compare the constant term**: - The constant term obtained from the product is ( p cdot r ). - It must equal ( d ), so ( p cdot r = d ). - Since ( d ) is odd, ( p ) must be odd. 5. **Use the remainder theorem**: - When evaluating ( varphi(x) ) at ( -p ), if ( x + p ) is a factor, then ( varphi(-p) ) should be zero. - Calculate ( varphi(-p) ): [ varphi(-p) = -p^3 + bp^2 - cp + d ] 6. **Parity analysis**: - Since ( p ) is odd, ( -p^3 ) is odd (since the power of an odd number is odd). - ( p^2 ) is odd (since the square of an odd number is odd), and thus ( bp^2 ) is odd (since ( b ) is odd). - ( -cp ) is even because ( c ) is even and the product of an even number and an odd number is even. - ( d ) is odd. 7. **Sum of terms**: - The expression ( varphi(-p) = -p^3 + bp^2 - cp + d ) evaluates to the sum of three odd numbers and one even number: [ text{odd} + text{odd} + text{even} + text{odd} ] - This sum is odd because an odd number of odd terms will result in an odd sum when one additional even term is included. 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, ( varphi(-p) neq 0 ). - It follows that ( x + p ) cannot be a factor of ( varphi(x) ). - Thus, ( varphi(x) ) cannot be factored into the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients.

By the theorem on tangent and secant, we have: [ BL^2 = LA cdot LK quad Rightarrow quad (6a)^2 = LA cdot (LA + 5a) ] Solving this, we get: [ 36a^2 = LA(LA + 5a) ] Let ( LA = x ): [ 36a^2 = x(x + 5a) quad Rightarrow quad x^2 + 5ax - 36a^2 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation: [ x = frac{-5a + sqrt{25a^2 + 144a^2}}{2} = frac{-5a + 13a}{2} = 4a quad (text{since x has to be positive}) ] Therefore, ( LA = 4a ). 3. **Determining ( AC ) in Terms of ( ML )**: Since ( AC parallel ML ): [ frac{KC}{CM} = frac{KA}{AL} = frac{5a}{4a} = frac{5}{4} ] Hence: [ AC = frac{5}{9} times ML = frac{5}{9} times 9sqrt{3} = 5sqrt{3} ] 4. **Finding ( angle MKL )**: Let ( R = 5 ), the radius of the circle. Since this circle is inscribed around triangle ( AKC ): [ sin angle AKC = frac{AC}{2R} = frac{5sqrt{3}}{10} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Therefore, ( angle MKL = angle AKC = 60^circ ), since ( sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). 5. **Verification**: The angle ( angle MKL ) could be 60° or 120°. However, we verify that the possibility of ( angle MKL = 120^circ ) leads to contradictions: If ( angle MKL = 120^circ ), the arc ( ABC ) would be 240°, making the distance from point ( K ) to line ( AC ) less than from point ( B ), contradicting ( frac{KA}{AL} = frac{5}{4} ). 6. **Area Calculation**: Let ( KC = 5b ) and ( CM = 4b ). We then apply the theorem on tangent and secant: [ BM = sqrt{CM cdot KM} = sqrt{4b cdot (9b)} = 6b ] Thus, ( ML = 6a + 6b ). Applying the law of cosines: [ ML^2 = KM^2 + KL^2 - 2 cdot KM cdot KL cdot cos 60^circ ] [ (6a + 6b)^2 = 81b^2 + 81a^2 - 81ab ] Simplifying: [ 4(a + b)^2 = 9(a^2 + b^2) - 9ab quad Rightarrow quad 5(a^2 + b^2) - 17ab = 0 ] Since: [ a + b = frac{1}{6}ML = frac{1}{6} cdot 9sqrt{3} = frac{3}{2} sqrt{3} ] We solve: [ 3sqrt{27}=81 27ab = 5 times left( frac{3}{2}sqrt{3} right)^2 = frac{135}{4} quad Rightarrow quad ab = frac{5}{4} ] Therefore, the area of ( triangle KLM ): [ S_{triangle KLM} = frac{1}{2} cdot 9a cdot 9b cdot sin 60^circ = frac{81 cdot frac{5}{4} cdot sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{405sqrt{3}}{16} ] # Conclusion: The angle ( MKL ) is ( 60^circ ) and the area of the triangle ( KLM ) is: [ boxed{frac{405sqrt{3}}{16}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( P_{n}(x) = x^{n} + ldots ) be a polynomial of degree ( n ) with a leading coefficient of 1, and suppose ( left| P_{n}(x) right| leq frac{1}{2^{n1}} ) for ( |x| leq 1 ).

The operations A and B are applied alternately on the numbers written on the blackboard, starting with operation A. Operation A subtracts a natural number from each number on the blackboard. Operation B erases two numbers and writes their sum. 2. Each pair of A and B operations will reduce the total count of numbers on the blackboard by 1. Consequently, after 1987 pairs of operations (1987 applications of A and 1987 applications of B), the number of numbers on the blackboard will be reduced to 1. 3. Let d_k be the number subtracted in the k-th A operation, where k=1, 2, ldots, 1987. 4. Initially, the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1988 is: sum_{k=1}^{1988} k = frac{1988 cdot 1989}{2} 5. After each k-th A operation, the sum of the numbers on the blackboard decreases by (1989-k) d_k. The reason is that if each number on the blackboard is decreased by d_k, there are (1989-k) numbers left after k operations. 6. After 1987 operations of A, the sum of the numbers remaining on the blackboard can be written as: frac{1988 cdot 1989}{2} - sum_{k=1}^{1987} (1989-k) d_k 7. Since operation B does not change the overall sum but only decreases the count of numbers, the critical part of our analysis revolves around ensuring the sum reduction does not exceed the scope intended by the problem (i.e., maintaining a non-negative sum): 8. For the sum to remain non-negative post all A operations and B operations, consider: (1989 - k)(1 - d_k) leq 0 quad text{for all} k=1, 2, ldots, 1987 This implies 1 - d_k leq 0, and hence d_k geq 1. 9.

This condition results in: x leq (1989 - k)(1 - d_k) + left(text{remaining terms}right) leq -1 which is a contradiction because the number left on the blackboard should be non-negative. 11. Therefore, d_k = 1 for all k = 1, 2, ldots, 1987, limiting all subtractions effectively to 1 per each step when considering the total operation sum adjustments. 12. From this premise: frac{1988 cdot 1989}{2} - 1988 cdot 1 - 1987 cdot 1 - cdots - 2 cdot 1 simplifies to: 1 = frac{1988 cdot 1989}{2} - left[sum_{k = 1}^{1987}(1989 - k)right] 13.

This increase in water level means that the height ( h ) of the water column above the bottom of the container increases. 4. **Calculate the new pressure:** - Let the initial height of the water column be ( h_0 ). - After the wooden block is submerged, let the new height of the water column be ( h_1 ). Clearly, ( h_1 > h_0 ). - The new pressure at the bottom of the container is given by: [ P_1 = P_0 + rho cdot g cdot h_1 ] - Since ( h_1 > h_0 ), it follows that: [ rho cdot g cdot h_1 > rho cdot g cdot h_0 ] - Hence: [ P_1 > P_0 + rho cdot g cdot h_0 ] - Therefore, the final pressure ( P_1 ) at the bottom of the container is greater than the initial pressure ( P_0 + rho cdot g cdot h ). # Conclusion: The pressure at the bottom of the container will increase when a wooden block is submerged in the water due to the increased height of the water column.

Let the segment ( DE ) intersect sides ( AB ) and ( BC ) at points ( F ) and ( G ), and let ( I ) be the incenter of ( triangle ABC ), i.e., the intersection of the angle bisectors of ( triangle ABC ). # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Angle Relationships:** By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal. Thus, [ angle BED = angle BCD quad text{and} quad angle BCD = angle ACD = angle AED. ] Therefore, [ angle BED = angle AED. ] 2. **Symmetry with Respect to the Line ( DE ):** Given the symmetry around line ( DE ), we find that lines ( BE ) and ( AE ) are symmetric about ( DE ). Likewise, line ( BD ) symmetrically maps to ( DC ). Consequently, point ( B ) (intersection of lines ( BE ) and ( BD )) maps to the incenter ( I ) intersection of ( AE ) and ( DC ). Therefore, line ( FG ) passes through the midpoint of the diagonal ( BI ) of quadrilateral ( BFIG ) and is perpendicular to it. 3. **Midpoint and Perpendicular Bisector:** Since ( BV ) is the angle bisector of ( angle FB G ), points ( F ) and ( G ) must lie symmetrically with respect to ( BI ). And because ( FG ) passes through the midpoint (incenter ( I )), it bisects ( BI ) perpendicularly. 4. **Proving Rhombus:** For ( BFIG ) to be a rhombus, each side must be of equal length and the diagonals ( BF ) and ( IG ) must be perpendicular to each other, equally bisecting each other at right angles. Since ( I ) is the incenter and lies on angle bisectors, it ensures equal segments along each side. Therefore, in triangle ( BIF ) and triangle ( BIG ), each side must be equal considering ( BI ) is an angle bisector and cutting the angle into symmetrical parts. # Conclusion: Given the points and conditions in this setup, we have established ( BF = BG ), ( IF = IG ), and the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, ensuring quadrilateral ( BFIG ) is a rhombus.

Prove that: a) (O) is the point of intersection of the medians of triangle (MNP); b) (O) is the point of intersection of the medians of the triangle formed by the lines (AN), (BP), and (CM). Part (a) 1. **Consider an Affine Transformation**: - We perform an affine transformation that maps triangle (ABC) to an equilateral triangle (A'B'C'). Affine transformations preserve the collinearity and the ratio of distances on a line. 2. **Mapping Points**: - Under this transformation, (O) becomes (O'), and points (M), (N), and (P) are mapped to (M'), (N'), and (P') respectively. 3. **Rotation by 120 Degrees**: - A rotation of (120^circ) around (O') will map the triangle (M'N'P') to itself because (M'N'P') inherits the properties of the equilateral triangle formed by equal ratios on the sides (p:q). 4. **Implication for Medians**: - Since the equilateral triangle (M'N'P') has (O') as the intersection of its medians, this property must hold for the original triangle (MNP) before the affine transformation. 5. **Conclusion of Affine Property**: - Affine transformations map medians to medians.

This setup allows us to treat points and projections ( p_{i} ) mathematically as functions that map numbers to numbers. 5. **Uniqueness of the Fixed Point:** - Since each ( l_{i} ) is a line, the functions ( p_{i} ) are linear transformations. Thus, the composition ( f ) is also a linear function. The problem now is to show that this function has a unique fixed point. 6. **Linear Properties and Fixed Point Analysis:** - In a plane, a sequence of orthogonal projections onto lines would yield a linear transformation. Let's denote this transformation as: [ f(x) = ax + b ] where ( a ) and ( b ) are constants. A fixed point ( x ) meets the condition: [ f(x) = x implies ax + b = x implies (a-1)x + b = 0 ] 7. **Solving for the Fixed Point:** - Solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{-b}{a-1} ] This ( x ) exists if ( a neq 1 ). However, if some lines are not parallel, the composed function ( f ) does not degenerate, ensuring ( a neq 1 ). 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of the point ( X_1 ) on ( l_1 ) that maps to itself after the series of projections are guaranteed.

Let the function be g(x) = frac{1}{3}x^3 frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x frac{5}{12}. Find the value of g(frac{1}{2018}) + g(frac{2}{2018}) + ldots + g(frac{2017}{2018}).","completion":"1.

Find g(frac{1}{2}): g(frac{1}{2}) = 1 4. Therefore, the function g(x) is symmetric about the point (frac{1}{2}, 1), which implies g(x) + g(1 - x) = 2. 5. By pairing the terms in the sum, we can see that each pair adds up to 2, with the middle term being g(frac{1009}{2018}): g(frac{1}{2018}) + g(frac{2017}{2018}) = g(frac{2}{2018}) + g(frac{2016}{2018}) = ldots = 2g(frac{1009}{2018}) = 2 6.

Now, we want to find frac{sin alpha+cos alpha}{sin alpha-cos alpha}. We can rewrite this using the fact that tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}.

The rest of the board is now (532 times 533) cells in size and can still be tiled by dominos. However, removing a cell at (B) instead should also make tiling the board by dominos possible. 5. **Link Between Different Tilings**: The problem specifies that the number of ways to tile the board without cell (A) does not equal the number of ways to tile it without cell (B). Observe that removing cell (A) changes the boundary condition for particular shapes of domino arrangements, as does removing (B). 6. **Establishing Non-Equality**: Consider tiling the board without cell (B). - The number of ways to tile the board without cell (B) may produce tiles with specific configurations that cannot be transformed to cover the removal of cell (A). 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, any arrangement of dominos that results from the removal of cell (B) cannot account for all the arrangements that would work when cell (A) is removed. [ boxed {Therefore, the number of ways to tile the board with one specific cell removed differs depending on which cell is removed (given they are the same color), leading to the conclusion. } ]"},{"prompt":"Amar takes as much time in running 15 meters as a car takes in covering 40 meters.

We need to find out what that certain distance is in kilometers for the car. First, let's find the ratio of the distances covered by Amar and the car in the same time T: Distance covered by Amar / Distance covered by the car = 15 meters / 40 meters = 3/8 Now, we know that Amar covers 712.5 meters. We need to find out how much distance the car covers when Amar covers 712.5 meters. Let's denote the distance covered by the car as D_car. Using the ratio we found earlier: 712.5 meters / D_car = 3/8 Now, we can solve for D_car: D_car = (712.5 meters * 8) / 3 D_car = 5700 meters / 3 D_car = 1900 meters So, the car covers 1900 meters when Amar covers 712.5 meters. To convert the distance covered by the car from meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000 (since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters): D_car in kilometers = 1900 meters / 1000 D_car in kilometers = 1.9 kilometers Therefore, the distance covered by Amar during the time the car covers 1.9 kilometers is boxed{712.5} meters."},{"prompt":"Simplify: frac{24{m}^{3}{n}^{4}}{32{m}^{4}{n}^{2}}=______.","completion":"To simplify the given expression frac{24m^3n^4}{32m^4n^2}, we can factor out common terms and simplify step by step: [ begin{align*} frac{24m^3n^4}{32m^4n^2} &= frac{8m^3n^2 cdot 3n^2}{8m^3n^2 cdot 4m} &= frac{8m^3n^2}{8m^3n^2} cdot frac{3n^2}{4m} &= 1 cdot frac{3n^2}{4m} &= frac{3n^2}{4m}, end{align*} ] Thus, the simplified form of the given expression is boxed{frac{3n^2}{4m}}."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=sin (xfrac{π}{3})+sqrt{3}cos (xfrac{π}{3}).

In the first generation, each of the 8 original mice has P pups, so there are 8P pups in total. When these pups grow up, there are now 8 + 8P adult mice (the original 8 plus the 8P pups that have grown up). Each of these adult mice then has 6 more pups, so there are (8 + 8P) * 6 new pups. However, each adult mouse eats 2 of their pups due to stress, so we subtract 2 pups for each adult mouse: (8 + 8P) * 6 - 2 * (8 + 8P). The total number of mice after the second round of pups and the eating of some pups is the sum of the adult mice and the remaining pups: 8 + 8P + (8 + 8P) * 6 - 2 * (8 + 8P). We know that this total is 280 mice, so we can set up the equation: 8 + 8P + (8 + 8P) * 6 - 2 * (8 + 8P) = 280. Now let's simplify the equation: 8 + 8P + 48 + 48P - 16 - 16P = 280, 56 + 40P = 280.

There are (8) rows and (8) columns on the chessboard, resulting in a grid structure we must consider. 4. **Counting Intersections:** The exact number of cells intersected by the line is determined by how many times it intersects the horizontal and vertical boundaries. 5. **Maximum Intersections:** Consider the properties of grid lines and intersections: - A line cutting through the chessboard from one corner to the opposite corner can potentially cross ( 2 times 8 - 1 = 15 ) cells at most. To see why, imagine the line crossing into each new row and column as it progresses diagonally. Each time it enters a new row or column, it hits an additional cell. 6. **Theoretical Justification:** To elaborate further, note that the line crosses cells' boundaries. There are (8-1=7) vertical lines and (8-1=7) horizontal lines, making it possible for a line to intersect up to (7+7=14) internal cell boundaries. - Additionally, the line will cross two edges of the chessboard at the boundary, bringing the total number of intersected boundaries to (14 + 2 = 16). - The maximum number of cells will be one less than the number of intersection points on cell boundaries because each time it crosses a boundary; it enters a new cell. 7. **Concluding the Number of Cells:** Given that the theoretical maximum for a straight line intersecting a finite grid is (15) cells, the optimal crossing of such a line on an 8x8 chessboard concurs with our theoretical upward boundary. Thus, the maximum number of cells on an 8x8 chessboard which a single straight line can intersect is [ boxed{15}"},{"prompt":"f the points (3,1) and (4,6) are on the same side of the line 3x2y+a=0, then the range of values for a is ________ .","completion":"**Analysis** This problem involves understanding of plane regions and the solution of quadratic inequalities.

Given C:y^{2}=4x, we have 4a = 4, so a = 1. Therefore, the focus F is at (1,0), or F(1,0). 2. **Equation of the Directrix**: The directrix of a parabola y^2 = 4ax is a vertical line x = -a.

However, considering the context and the formula used, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the calculation of |AF| directly from the properties of the parabola. The correct approach involves using the definition of the parabola and the distance formula if needed. Since A lies on the parabola, its coordinates satisfy y^2 = 4x.

However, the direct calculation of |AF| as 3 + 1 = 4 seems to be an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the steps involved.

In plane geometry, two distinct lines that are both perpendicular to a third line cannot intersect each other. Thus, by definition, they are parallel. 2.

He spent 14 and then an additional 5, so in total, he spent 14 + 5 = 19 on lunch for himself. Now, let's calculate how much money Derek has left after spending on his own lunch. He started with 40 and spent 19, so he has 40 - 19 = 21 left. Dave started with 50 and spent 7 on lunch for his mom, so he has 50 - 7 = 43 left.

A geometric progression (GP) in ( mathbb{Z} / m mathbb{Z} ) takes the form: [ b, br, br^2, ldots (bmod m) ] for some initial term ( b ) and common ratio ( r ). 2. **Combine the Properties**: For a sequence to be both an AP and a GP, it must satisfy both forms. Suppose such a sequence is given by: [ a, a + d, a + 2d, ldots (bmod m) ] and also: [ b, br, br^2, ldots (bmod m). ] This implies: [ a = b, quad a + d = br, quad a + 2d = br^2, ldots ] 3. **Analyze the Equality**: For the arithmetic progression to match the geometric progression, the common difference ( d ) and the common ratio ( r ) must be related. Consider: [ a + d = br = a cdot r ] This yields: [ d = a(r - 1) ] Similarly for the second term: [ a + 2d = br^2 ] This gives: [ a + 2a(r - 1) = a cdot r^2 implies a(1 + 2(r - 1)) = a cdot r^2 ] Simplify: [ 1 + 2r - 2 = r^2 implies r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0 implies (r - 1)^2 = 0 implies r = 1. ] If ( r = 1 ), then ( d = a(r - 1) = 0 ). This means the sequence would be constant, which contradicts the nonconstant requirement. Therefore, ( a neq 0 ). 4. **Consider ( m ) and Divisibility**: To find when nonconstant solutions exist, consider when ( m ) is not squarefree. - **Squarefree ( m )**: If ( m ) is squarefree, it has no repeated prime factor. Then, for any arithmetic progression ((s - d, s, s + d)), to be geometric, the condition ( d^{2} equiv (s - d)(s + d) equiv s^2 - d^2 pmod{m} ) must hold. Simplifying, we get ( d^2 equiv 0 pmod{m} ), implying that ( d equiv 0 pmod{m} ). Thus, the sequence cannot be nonconstant. - **Non-Squarefree ( m )**: If ( p^2 mid m ) for some prime ( p ), consider the common difference ( d = m / p ). Since ( p cdot d = m ), ( d ) is not zero modulo ( m ), allowing nonconstant arithmetic-geometric progressions. # Conclusion: For the sequence to be both an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression yet nonconstant, ( m ) must not be squarefree.

However, (B) says, \\"A is a liar,\\" which contradicts the assumption that (A) is a knight. 5. Therefore, (A) cannot be a knight. Case 2: A is a Liar 1. If (A) is a liar, then (A) always lies. 2. (A) says, \\"B is a knight,\\" which must be a lie. 3. Therefore, (B) is not a knight. 4.

Hence, (A) must be lying when saying \\"B is a knight.\\" 4. This indicates that (B) is not a knight. 5. If (B) is not a knight, as before, (B) can either be a liar or a normal person. - If (B) is a liar, the statement \\"A is a liar\\" would have to be true, contradicting the notion that (B) always lies. - If (B) is a normal person, (B) may lie or tell the truth, and \\"A is a liar\\" being false supports the case that (A) was correct in lying and (B) told the truth in this particular instance. # Conclusion: These cases collectively prove that one of the individuals must be telling the truth or lying while not fitting the typical definitions of a knight or a liar.

If the area of each square is 1, find the total area of the overlapping black squares.","completion":"Let's break the problem down step-by-step to find the total area of all the intersecting black squares when one chessboard is rotated by 45^{circ}: 1. Consider two identical 8 times 8 chessboards, each with 64 squares (32 black and 32 white) and side length 8. 2. Before rotation, the area of the entire chessboard is [ 8 times 8 = 64 ] since each square has an area of 1. 3. When one of these chessboards is rotated by 45^{circ} about its center, the overlap region forms a perfect octagon. The length of the diagonal of the squares remains the side length multiplied by sqrt{2}. 4. To find the area of overlap (the octagon) after this 45^{circ} rotation, we calculate: [ text{Area of overlap} = 64 (sqrt{2} - 1) ] 5. Next, we can split this overlap area into four distinct sections based on the color of the squares: [ text{Sections:} quad (white, white), quad (white, black), quad (black, white), quad (black, black) ] We denote their areas as S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, S_{4} respectively. 6. Upon rotating one board 90^{circ}, the colors swap (white becomes black and vice versa), hence: [ S_{1} = S_{4}, quad S_{2} = S_{3} ] 7. Further rotating by another 45^{circ} and swapping the top and bottom boards is essentially equivalent to rotating 90^{circ} only for one board, leading to: [ S_{1} = S_{3} ] 8. Thus, given these relationships: [ S_{1} = S_{4}, quad S_{2} = S_{3}, quad S_{1} = S_{3} ] It follows that all sections have equal area: [ S_{1} = S_{2} = S_{3} = S_{4} ] 9. Since the total area of the overlap is 64 (sqrt{2} - 1), and it is divided equally among the four sections: [ S_{1} + S_{2} + S_{3} + S_{4} = 64 (sqrt{2} - 1) ] Hence, each of the S_i is: [ S_{1} = S_{2} = S_{3} = S_{4} = frac{64 (sqrt{2} - 1)}{4} = 16 (sqrt{2} - 1) ] 10. Finally, the area of all the black squares in the intersecting region is given by the section (black, black), which is: [ 32 (sqrt{2} - 1) ] # Conclusion: Thus, the total area of all intersecting black squares is [ boxed{32 (sqrt{2} - 1)} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that a and b are opposite numbers, c and d are reciprocals, and |m|=3, find the value of frac{a+b}{m}+cd+m.","completion":"Given that a and b are opposite numbers, c and d are reciprocals, and |m|=3, we are asked to find the value of frac{a+b}{m}+cd+m.

This circle will intersect the plane at an infinite number of points. Select one of these points and label it as point ( B ).

Let the arcs intersect at two points and label these intersections as ( C ) and ( D ). Draw the line segment ( CD ) which will intersect ( AB ) at ( M ). 5. **Constructing the Fourth Point:** Now, draw a circle centered at ( M ) with radius equal to ( sqrt{2}r ).

This is due to the specific choice of coefficients. 3. **Non-existence for ( n = -1 ):** Suppose ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with distinct coefficients, and ( P(x) ) is ( -1 )-independent. Let: [ P(x) = a_{2000} x^{2000} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0. ] Given ( P(-1) = sum_{i text{even}} a_i - sum_{i text{odd}} a_i = 0 ) or any permutation thereof, we need to ensure: For a subset ( E ) of ( C = {a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{2000}} ) having 1000 or 1001 elements, there exist elements ( e in E ) and ( f in C setminus E ) such that: [ S(E) - frac{1}{2} S(C) = e - f. ] Assuming ( a_0 < a_1 < cdots < a_{2000} ): Define ( E ) as a 1000-element subset of ( C ), excluding ( b_{1999} ) and ( b_{2000} ). The independence forces: Subsets ( E' = E cup { b_{1999}, b_{2000} } setminus { b_0, b_1 } ) require ( e' in E' ) and ( f' in C setminus E' ) to complete equalities similarly to ( E ). 4. **Summing ( |n| geq 2 ):** **Lemma:** Let ( n geq 2 ) be a natural number, and ( P(x) = a_m x^m + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ) a polynomial with distinct coefficients. Then ( { Q(n) mid Q in M(P) } ) contains at least ( 2^m ) elements. **Proof:** by induction on ( m ): For ( m = 1 ), it's trivial. Assume ( a_m < cdots < a_1 < a_0 ). Consider polynomials ( Q_k ) and ( Q_{k+1} ): [ Q_k(x) = a_m x^m + cdots + a_k x^k + a_0 x^{k-1} + b_{k-1} x^{k-2} + cdots + b_1, ] [ Q_{k+1}(x) = a_m x^m + cdots + a_{k+1} x^{k+1} + a_0 x^k + c_k x^{k-1} + cdots + c_1, ] Claim ( Q_{k+1}(n) geq Q_k(n) ): Polynomials of form ( Q_k(x) ) will take at least ( 2^{k-1} ) values at ( x = n ). 5. **Main Result for Large ( n ):** Polynomial ( P(x) = a_{2000} x^{2000} + a_{1999} x^{1999} + a_0 ) should produce ( 2^{1000} ) values.

For example: [ a = 0.5, quad b = 0.2 ] The product: [ a times b = 0.5 times 0.2 = 0.1 ] Clearly: [ 0.1 < 0.2 ] 2. **Case 2: One Number Negative, Another Positive Greater Than 1** Let's take two numbers a and b such that a is negative and less than 0, and b is positive and greater than 1, i.e., a < 0 and b > 1. - Product: a times b - Here, the product will be negative because the multiplication of a negative and a positive number is always negative, and thus it will be less than the positive number b.

Combining these choices, the total number of unique six-digit numbers that can be formed is calculated as follows: [3 times 2 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 = 720] However, this calculation includes numbers where the first digit is 3 and the fourth digit (thousands place) is 0, 1, or 2, which are not greater than 300,000. To correct for this, we subtract the numbers that start with 300,000 but are not valid due to the fourth digit's restriction: For numbers starting with 300,000, the first digit is fixed as 3, and the fourth digit (thousands place) can only be 0 or 1 (since it must be less than 2 to be considered in this subtraction), leaving 2 choices.

Therefore, ( p^l mid binom{n}{k} ), which implies ( p^l mid prod_{i=1}^{k}(n-i+1) ). Given that ( p > k ), it follows that there can only be one multiple of ( p ) among ( n, n-1, ldots, n-k+1 ). 3. **Finding the Multiple of ( p^l ):** Denote this single value as ( n-i_0 ) where ( i_0 in {0, 1, ldots, k-1} ). It thus follows that [ n geq n - i_0 geq p^l. ] Because ( p^l > k^l ) and ( k^l geq k^2 ), it entails that [ n geq p^l > k^l geq k^2. ] 4. **Representation Setup:** Suppose ( n - i = a_i m_i^l ), where ( m_i in mathbb{N}^* ) and ( a_i ) does not contain any ( l )-th power factor. Moreover, factors of ( a_i ) cannot exceed ( k ). Therefore, ( a_i )'s factors should permit ( prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i mid k! ). 5. **Contradiction with Uniqueness.** Let us prove that for all ( i neq j ), ( a_i neq a_j ). Assume towards a contradiction that ( exists i neq j ) such that ( a_i = a_j ). Given ( n-i > n-j ), we have: [ m_i > m_j quad text{or} quad m_i geq m_j + 1. ] This yields: [ k > j geq j - i = (n-i) - (n-j) = a_j (m_i^l - m_j^l) geq a_j ( (m_j + 1)^l - m_j^l ). ] By factorizing further: [ (m_j + 1)^l - m_j^l > l m_j^{l-1} = sqrt{a_j m_j^l} geq l sqrt{n-k+1} geq l sqrt{frac{n}{2}+1} > sqrt{n}. ] Thus, there is a contradiction with our initial assumption. 6. **Ordering of Values (a_i):** We need to show that ({a_0, a_1, cdots, a_{k-1}} = {1, 2, cdots, k}).

Let ( p_0 ) be a prime factor of ( v ). Then, ( p_0 ) must also be a factor of (prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i leq k).

Therefore, ( prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i mid k! ). 9. **Final Contradiction:** Since ( k geq 4 ), let ( i_1, i_2, i_3 ) such that ( a_{i_j} = 2^{j-1} (j = 1, 2, 3) ): [ n - i_1 = m_{i_1}^l, quad n - i_2 = 2m_{i_2}^l, quad n - i_3 = 4m_{i_3}^l. ] Assume a contradiction (left(n-i_2right)^2 = left(n-i_1right)left(n-i_3right)): [ b = n - i_2, quad x = b - (n - i_1), quad y = -b + (n - i_3). ] Given (b x y > n rightarrow k n^{2/3} > n^{2} rightarrow n > k^2): Contradicting our ( k^2 leq n ).

We can use the formula for compound interest to calculate the population after 2 years, since the population is increasing at a compound rate annually.

Find minimum possible value of d","completion":"1. **Identify the order of points on the semicircle:** Given the points (A), (B), (C), and (D) on the semicircle with diameter (AB = d), we need to determine the order of these points. Since ( |BC| = |CD| = a ) and ( |DA| = b ), the points must be in the order (A, D, C, B) on the semicircle. The order (A, C, D, B) would imply (B = D), which is impossible since (b neq d). 2. **Define the angles and use trigonometric identities:** Let (2theta) be the angle subtended by the arc (BC) at the center (O) of the semicircle. Then, the length (BC) can be expressed as: [ a = d sin theta ] Similarly, the length (DA) can be expressed using the angle (2theta) as: [ b = d cos 2theta ] Using the double-angle identity for cosine, we have: [ cos 2theta = 1 - 2sin^2 theta ] Substituting (sin theta = frac{a}{d}) into the equation, we get: [ b = d left(1 - 2 left(frac{a}{d}right)^2right) = d - frac{2a^2}{d} ] 3. **Formulate the equation:** Rearranging the equation (b = d - frac{2a^2}{d}), we get: [ bd = d^2 - 2a^2 ] This can be rewritten as: [ 2a^2 = d(d - b) ] 4. **Analyze the divisibility and coprimality:** If (p) is a common divisor of (b) and (d), then (p^2) must divide (2a^2). Since (a), (b), and (d) are different positive integers, (b) and (d) must be coprime. Therefore, we consider two cases: - (d = 2m^2) and (d - b = n^2) with (a = mn) - (d = m^2) and (d - b = 2n^2) with (a = mn) 5. **Evaluate the first case:** - For (d = 2m^2) and (d - b = n^2): - If (m = 1), then (d = 2) and (b = 1), which implies (a = 1). This is impossible since (a), (b), and (d) must be different. - If (m = 2), then (d = 8) and (d - b = 7), so (b = 1). This implies (a = 2 times 1 = 2). Thus, ((a, b, d) = (2, 1, 8)). 6. **Evaluate the second case:** - For (d = m^2) and (d - b = 2n^2): - If (m = 1), there is no valid (b). - If (m = 2), then (d = 4) and (d - b = 2), so (b = 2). This implies (a = 2 times 1 = 2), which is impossible since (a = b). - If (m = 3), then (d = 9) and (d - b = 2n^2). This gives a solution greater than the one already found. 7. **Conclusion:** The minimum possible value of (d) is found in the first case with (m = 2), giving (d = 8).

If |FQ|=6, then the directrix equation of C is ____.","completion":"To solve the problem, let's follow the steps closely related to the given solution: 1. **Assumption about P's location**: Since P is on the parabola C:y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right) and we assume it's in the first quadrant, the coordinates of P can be derived from the general point on the parabola. For a parabola with a focus at (frac{p}{2}, 0), a point P on the parabola at a distance p from the vertex along the axis of symmetry would have coordinates Pleft(frac{p}{2}, pright). 2. **Slope of OP (k_{OP})**: The slope of the line connecting the origin O to point P is calculated using the change in y over the change in x. Thus, k_{OP} = frac{p - 0}{frac{p}{2} - 0} = frac{p}{frac{p}{2}} = 2. 3. **Slope of PQ (k_{PQ})**: Since PQ is perpendicular to OP, the slope of PQ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OP. Therefore, k_{PQ} = -frac{1}{k_{OP}} = -frac{1}{2}. 4. **Equation of PQ**: Using the point-slope form of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line, the equation of PQ is y - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). 5. **Finding x when y=0**: Setting y=0 in the equation of PQ to find the x-intercept, we get 0 - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). Solving for x gives x = frac{5p}{2}. 6. **Given |FQ|=6**: The distance |FQ| is the difference in the x-coordinates of F and Q. Since F is at (frac{p}{2}, 0) and Q is at (frac{5p}{2}, 0), we have |FQ| = left|frac{5p}{2} - frac{p}{2}right| = 6. Solving this equation for p gives p = 3. 7. **Directrix of the parabola**: The directrix of a parabola y^{2}=2px is a vertical line x = -frac{p}{2}. Substituting p = 3 into this formula gives the directrix equation as x = -frac{3}{2}.

The conditions given are: 1. If a slow horse delivers the document, it takes 1 day longer than the specified time x, so the time taken by the slow horse is x + 1 days. 2. If a fast horse delivers the document, it takes 2 days less than the specified time x, so the time taken by the fast horse is x - 2 days. 3. The speed of the fast horse is frac{5}{2} times the speed of the slow horse. Since speed is inversely proportional to time when distance is constant, we can set up the equation based on the speeds of the horses and the times taken by them to cover the same distance of 800 miles. Let's denote the speed of the slow horse as S and the speed of the fast horse as frac{5}{2}S. The equations based on the given conditions are: - For the slow horse: Distance = Speed times Time Rightarrow 800 = S times (x + 1) - For the fast horse: Distance = Speed times Time Rightarrow 800 = frac{5}{2}S times (x - 2) To find the equation that represents the specified time x, we need to equate the distances covered by both horses, as they are the same but with different speeds and times. This gives us the equation: [ frac{800}{x + 1} = frac{5}{2} times frac{800}{x - 2} ] This equation correctly represents the relationship between the speeds of the two horses, the distance covered, and the specified time x.

Alternatively, we can calculate it by multiplying 24 by 4 and then adding the result to 12.

This means all (x_i) are multiples of 7. 3. **Infinite Descent for Integer Case**: Denote ( x_i = 7y_i ) where ( y_i ) are still integers. Rewriting the problem in terms of (y_i), we get a similar setup. Continuing this process by infinite descent shows that all ( y_i ), hence all ( x_i ), must be zero. 4. **General Real Case**: Now consider ( x_i ) as real numbers. We proceed via approximation: begin{itemize} item Choose ( N ) large enough such that ( N > frac{1}{|x_i|} ) for all non-zero ( x_i ). This ensures that ( N | x_i | < 1 ) for all ( x_i neq 0 ). item By the pigeonhole principle, there exist an integer ( D ) and integers ( p_i ) such that: [ left| D x_i - p_i right| leq frac{1}{155N} quad forall i ] end{itemize} 5. **Verification for Approximation**: Take any subset ( I subseteq {1, ldots, 2007} ) of cardinality 7. We find a subset ( J subseteq {1, ldots, 2007} ) of cardinality 11 such that: [ 11 sum_{i in I} D x_i = 7 sum_{j in J} D x_j ] Evaluating both sides, involve using ( p_i approx D x_i ): [ left| 11 sum_{i in I} p_i - 7 sum_{j in J} p_j right| = left| 11 sum_{i in I} (p_i - D x_i) - 7 sum_{j in J} (p_j - D x_j) right| ] [ leq 11 sum_{i in I} left| p_i - D x_i right| + 7 sum_{j in J} left| p_j - D x_j right| leq frac{154}{155N} < 1 ] The left side is an integer less than 1, therefore it must be zero: [ 11 sum_{i in I} p_i = 7 sum_{j in J} p_j ] Using the integer case, we conclude ( p_i = 0 ). 6. **Conclusion**: Since ( |D x_i - p_i| leq frac{1}{155N} ), and all ( p_i = 0 ), it follows that: [ left| x_i right| leq left| frac{1}{155N} right| < frac{1}{155N} ] As ( N ) is large, this forces ( x_i = 0 ).

Now, consider the sums of four consecutive numbers: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4, quad a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5, quad a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6, ldots ] These must be odd. 6. Using the fact that each group of four numbers sums to an odd number: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + a_4 ] Since (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) is even, (a_4) must be odd to make the total sum odd. By a similar method: [ a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = (a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + a_5 ] Since (a_2 + a_3 + a_4) is even, (a_5) must also be odd. Continuing this logic: [ a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = (a_3 + a_4 + a_5) + a_6 ] If (a_4) and (a_5) are odd, (a_6) must be odd as well to make the sum (a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6) odd. 7. Given the parity constraints derived: [ {a_4, a_5, a_6, ldots} text{ must be odd} ] This results in a contradiction, as the initial sums (a_4 + a_5 + a_6) would not satisfy being even. 8. This contradiction proves that no such sequence of six or more numbers can exist. Thus, we must test shorter sequences. 9. We test the sequence length of 5: Let's take (a_3) to be even, and (a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5) to be odd.

Show that among these five points, three can be chosen to form an obtuse triangle. To solve this problem, we will consider three distinct cases based on the arrangement of the points. 1. **Case 1: The points form a convex pentagon.** - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is ( 540^circ ). - Thus, each interior angle must be ( frac{540^circ}{5} = 108^circ ) on average, but since not all interior angles have to be exactly 108°, necessarily at least one of them will be ( geq 108^circ ). This indicates the presence of an obtuse angle. - If an angle is ( geq 108^circ ), then the triangle formed by that vertex and its two adjacent vertices has an angle (geq 108^circ), making the triangle obtuse. Hence, in the case of a convex pentagon, we find an obtuse triangle. 2. **Case 2: The convex hull of the points is a quadrilateral.** - In this case, one of the points lies inside the convex quadrilateral. - When we connect this internal point to the four vertices of the quadrilateral, we form four triangles. - The angles around the internal point sum up to ( 360^circ ). - Not all four angles can be ( 90^circ ), because if they were, the internal point would coincide with the intersection of the diagonals, implying collinearity of points, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, there must be at least one angle less than ( 90^circ ) and at least one angle greater than ( 90^circ ). The triangle corresponding to an angle larger than ( 90^circ ) can be chosen as an obtuse triangle. 3. **Case 3: The convex hull of the points is a triangle.** - Here, two points lie inside the convex hull, i.e., the triangle. - Fix one of these interior points, and connect it to the three vertices of the convex triangle to form three smaller triangles. - The angles around the interior point will sum to ( 360^circ ). - By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these three angles must be ( geq 120^circ ) (since three angles sum to ( 360^circ )). Any triangle that contains an angle (geq 120^circ) will be obtuse. # Conclusion: In all three cases, we can always find a triangle among the five points that is obtuse.

If three points were collinear, selecting any fourth point from the set would result in a configuration where the four points do not form a convex quadrilateral, contradicting our assumption. Hence, no three points among the 2015 points are collinear. 3. **Convex Hull**: Let us denote the convex hull of these 2015 points by ( mathcal{K} ). The convex hull ( mathcal{K} ) must be a convex polygon. 4. **Contradiction-Based Argument**: Let’s assume, for contradiction, that the convex hull ( mathcal{K} ) does not include all 2015 points as its vertices.

Draw ( n-3 ) diagonals from ( A_1 ) to other non-adjacent vertices of ( mathcal{K} ). These diagonals split ( mathcal{K} ) into ( n-2 ) triangles. 6. **Placement of Points Inside ( mathcal{K} )**: If there's a point ( P ) among the 2015 points that lies inside ( mathcal{K} ), it must lie inside one of these ( n-2 ) triangles.

Therefore, f'(x) = -1 - frac{2}{x^2} < 0, which implies that f(x) is decreasing in the interval (0, +infty). Thus, the function is boxed{text{decreasing on } (0, +infty)}. **3. Finding the range of the real number t** Given that |t-1| leq f(x) + 2 for x in [-2,-1] cup [1,2], we first find the range of f(x) in these intervals. Since f(x) = -x + frac{2}{x}, for x in [-2,-1] cup [1,2], the function's output range is [-1,1]. Therefore, f(x) + 2 in [1,3]. Given |t-1| leq f(x) + 2 and f(x) + 2 in [1,3], it follows that |t-1| leq 3 but also |t-1| leq 1 for the defined range of f(x)+2. Therefore, t-1 leq 1 and t-1 geq -1. This gives us t leq 2 and t geq 0, which means t in [0,2].

We know that the average marks of all boys is 37, the average marks of passed boys is 39, and the average marks of failed boys is 15. We also know that there are 110 boys who passed. The total marks of all boys can be represented as 37T (since the average is 37 and there are T boys in total). The total marks of passed boys can be represented as 39 * 110 (since the average is 39 and there are 110 boys who passed). The total marks of failed boys can be represented as 15F (since the average is 15 and there are F boys who failed). Since the total marks of all boys is the sum of the total marks of passed boys and failed boys, we can write the following equation: 37T = 39 * 110 + 15F Now, we also know that the total number of boys is the sum of passed and failed boys: T = 110 + F We can substitute T from the second equation into the first equation: 37(110 + F) = 39 * 110 + 15F Expanding the left side of the equation: 4070 + 37F = 4290 + 15F Now, let's move all terms involving F to one side and constants to the other side: 37F - 15F = 4290 - 4070 22F = 220 Now, divide both sides by 22 to solve for F: F = 220 / 22 F = 10 So, there are 10 boys who failed the examination.

If there exists at least one point x_0 in the interval [1,e] such that f(x_0) > g(x_0), find the range of possible values for p.","completion":"(I) First, we compute the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = pleft(1+ frac{1}{x^2}right) - frac{2}{x}. Since f(x) has an extremum at x=2, its derivative at that point is zero. Thus, we set f'(2) = 0: pleft(1+ frac{1}{2^2}right) - frac{2}{2} = 0, frac{5}{4}p - 1 = 0, which gives us p = boxed{frac{4}{5}}. (II) For f(x) to be monotonic, either f'(x) geq 0 or f'(x) leq 0 must hold true for all x in its domain. Considering the case f'(x) geq 0: p geq frac{2x}{x^2+1} text{ for all } x > 0.

No three points are collinear. 2. For any ( i, j, k ), the area of the triangle ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{k} ) is equal to ( r_{i} + r_{j} + r_{k} ). First, consider four points ( A_{i}, A_{j}, A_{k}, A_{l} ) forming a convex quadrilateral in this order. Denote the area as (mathcal{A}). We have: [ mathcal{A}(A_{i} A_{j} A_{k} A_{l}) = mathcal{A}(A_{i} A_{j} A_{k}) + mathcal{A}(A_{k} A_{l} A_{i}) = mathcal{A}(A_{j} A_{k} A_{l}) + mathcal{A}(A_{l} A_{i} A_{j}) ] Rewriting this using the given conditions: [ r_{i} + r_{k} = r_{j} + r_{l} ] Next, consider a convex pentagon ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{k} A_{l} A_{m} ). Applying the previous result to the convex quadrilaterals ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{k} A_{l} ) and ( A_{j} A_{k} A_{l} A_{m} ), we get: [ r_{i} + r_{k} = r_{j} + r_{l} = r_{k} + r_{m} ] From this, it follows that: [ r_{i} = r_{m} ] By iterating this reasoning, we conclude that: [ r_{i} = r_{j} = r_{k} = r_{l} = r_{m} ] Given this, the triangles ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{k} ), ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{l} ), and ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{m} ) all have the same area ( 3r_{i} ). Consequently, the points ( A_{k}, A_{l}, A_{m} ) are all at the same distance from the line ( (A_{i} A_{j}) ). As the pentagon ( A_{i} A_{j} A_{k} A_{l} A_{m} ) is convex, these points must also all lie on the same side of this line, making them collinear, which contradicts the given condition that no three points are collinear. Hence, there cannot be a convex pentagon among the points. In particular, the convex hull of these points contains at most 4 points. Without loss of generality, denote this convex hull as ( A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{m} ) with ( m leq 4 ). Consider a point ( A_{i} ) not belonging to this convex hull (( i > m )).

If ( i ) and ( i' ) are such points, then for any ( k, l leq m ), the areas ( mathcal{A}(A_{k} A_{l} A_{i}) ) and ( mathcal{A}(A_{k} A_{l} A_{i'}) ) must be equal, making the line ( (A_{i} A_{i'}) ) parallel to ( (A_{k} A_{l}) ). Considering all such points in the convex hull, we arrive at ( i = i' ). Given ( m leq 4 ), ( n leq 5 ). For ( n = 4 ), one can simply take a square with all ( r_{i} ) equal. To show ( n = 5 ) is impossible, let’s consider ( m = 4 ) and point ( A_{5} ).

Let the point of tangency to the curve y=x^2-1 be (n,n^2-1) and to the curve y=aln x-1 be (m,aln m-1). The tangent equation at (n,n^2-1) is obtained by the point-slope form of the tangent line: y - (n^2 - 1) = 2n(x - n), which simplifies to y = 2nx - n^2 - 1. Similarly, the tangent equation at (m,aln m-1) is y - (aln m - 1) = frac{a}{m}(x - m), which simplifies to y = frac{a}{m}x - a + aln m - 1.

Given the problem, we need to find the total number of ways to color each vertex of the tetrahedron ( S-ABC ) using 5 different colors such that no two vertices of the same edge have the same color. 2. Let's start by coloring the vertices ( S ), ( A ), and ( B ). Since there are 5 different colors available, we can assign a color to ( S ) in 5 different ways. Once ( S ) is colored, we have 4 colors left for ( A ). After coloring ( A ), there will be 3 colors left for ( B ). Therefore, the number of ways to color the vertices ( S ), ( A ), and ( B ) ensuring they all have different colors is: [ 5 times 4 times 3 = 60 ] 3. Next, we will consider the possible colorings for vertices ( C ) and ( D ) once ( S ), ( A ), and ( B ) have already been colored. Suppose the colors for ( S ), ( A ), and ( B ) are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. 4. We need to ensure that the coloring of ( C ) and ( D ) respects the constraint that no two adjacent vertices share the same color: - If ( C ) is colored with color 2, then ( D ) must not be colored 2 or 3 (since it is adjacent to both ( C ) and ( B )). Therefore, ( D ) can be colored with one of the colors 3, 4, or 5. Thus, there are 3 possible ways for ( D ). - If ( C ) is colored with color 4, then ( D ) cannot be colored 4 or the same color as ( B ) (which is 3). Thus, ( D ) can be colored with colors 3 or 5. Hence, there are 2 possible ways for ( D ). - If ( C ) is colored with color 5, then ( D ) cannot be colored 5 or the same color as ( B ) (which is 3). Thus, ( D ) can be colored with colors 3 or 4. Hence, there are 2 possible ways for ( D ). 5. The total number of ways to color ( C ) and ( D ) given colors of ( S ), ( A ), and ( B ) is: [ 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 ] 6.

This is because if no such triangle exists, then we could only have one line containing blue points, contradicting our indirect assumption by having a triangle with all red vertices and centroid. 3. **Centroid of Triangle ( triangle ABC)**: - Given our initial assumption, the centroid ( S ) of ( triangle ABC ) must be red. 4. **Scaling the Triangle**: - Magnify ( triangle ABC ) by a factor of 4 from the centroid ( S ). Let the resulting triangle be ( triangle A'B'C' ). - ( S ) remains the centroid of ( triangle A'B'C' ) since the centroid scales linearly with the triangle. 5. **Relations After Scaling**: - Clearly, ( triangle A'B'C' ) is similar to ( triangle ABC ) but scaled by a factor of 4. - From geometric properties, the distances to the centroid scale proportionally. Specifically, ( frac{SA'}{SA}=4 ), thus ( AA' = 3 cdot AS ). 6. **Calculations and Consequences**: - Let ( F ) be the midpoint of ( BC ). - By centroid properties, ( AS = frac{2}{3} AF ). Therefore, [ AA' = 3 cdot AS = 3 cdot frac{2}{3} AF = 2 cdot AF. ] - This implies that ( A ) is the centroid of ( triangle A'BC ). Hence ( A' ) must be red due to our indirect assumption. 7. **Repeating for Other Vertices**: - By similar arguments, applying the same steps for vertices ( B ) and ( C ), we show that ( B' ) and ( C' ) are also red. 8. **Contradiction**: - Consequently, ( triangle A'B'C' ) has all vertices ( A', B', C' ) and centroid ( S ) red, which contradicts our initial assumption that no such triangle can exist. # Conclusion: Thus, there must exist at least one triangle in the plane such that its vertices and centroid are all the same color.

This limit is commonly known as the derivative of ( f ) at ( x_0 ), denoted ( f'(x_0) ). 2. One necessary condition for the above limit to exist is that the function ( y = f(x) ) must be continuous at ( x_0 ).

Some examples include: - Functions with a sharp corner or cusp at ( x_0 ). - Functions with a vertical tangent line at ( x_0 ). 4.

Assuming Team A can possibly be the last place team, we need to analyze if this is feasible given the constraints. 2. Let's denote the other 24 teams as B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{24}. We organize the 25 teams into 8 groups: - The 1st group consists of {A, B_1, B_2, B_3}. - Each of the remaining 7 groups consists of 3 teams. 3. Consider the match results in the 1st group: - A wins against B_1 with a score of 4:0. - A loses to B_2 with a score of 0:1. - A loses to B_3 with a score of 0:1. - B_1 wins against B_2 with a score of 1:0. - B_1 wins against B_3 with a score of 1:0. - B_2 draws with B_3 with a score of 2:2. 4. In the other seven groups, suppose each group’s 3 teams compete such that each team wins one match and loses one match, with match results of 2:1. Matches between teams from different groups have results of 0:0. 5. Summarizing the points for the first group: - Team A: (1) win, (2) losses, (21) draws, resulting in (23) points (as per the soccer scoring rules: (3) points for a win, (1) point for a draw, (0) points for a loss). - Team B_1: (2) wins, (1) loss, (21) draws, resulting in (25) points. - Teams B_2 and B_3: each with (1) win, (1) loss, (22) draws, resulting in (24) points each. 6. For the other 21 teams in the other 7 groups, each team has (1) win, (1) loss, and (22) draws, resulting in (24) points. 7. Hence, Team A ends up being the last with the fewest points due to having only (23) points while all other teams have either (24) or (25) points. 8. Goal computations for validation: - Team A scores 4 goals and concedes 2 goals. - Team B_1 scores 2 goals and concedes 4 goals. - Teams B_2 and B_3 each score 3 goals and concede 3 goals. - Each of the other teams (from B_4 to B_{24}) scores 3 goals and concedes 3 goals. 9. Observing the total goals scored and conceded further confirms that Team A scored the most goals and conceded the least compared to any other team, satisfying the second condition given in the problem. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and distribution of points, Team A could end up in the last place despite scoring the most goals and conceding the least.

Overall, how much profit did he make?","completion":"First, let's calculate the selling price of the grinder and the mobile phone. The grinder was sold at a loss of 4%. The loss amount on the grinder is: Loss on grinder = 4% of Rs. 15000 = (4/100) * 15000 = 0.04 * 15000 = Rs. 600 So, the selling price of the grinder is: Selling price of grinder = Purchase price - Loss = Rs. 15000 - Rs. 600 = Rs. 14400 The mobile phone was sold at a profit of 15%. The profit amount on the mobile is: Profit on mobile = 15% of Rs. 8000 = (15/100) * 8000 = 0.15 * 8000 = Rs. 1200 So, the selling price of the mobile phone is: Selling price of mobile = Purchase price + Profit = Rs. 8000 + Rs. 1200 = Rs. 9200 Now, let's calculate the total cost price and the total selling price to find out the overall profit. Total cost price (TCP) = Cost of grinder + Cost of mobile = Rs. 15000 + Rs. 8000 = Rs. 23000 Total selling price (TSP) = Selling price of grinder + Selling price of mobile = Rs. 14400 + Rs. 9200 = Rs. 23600 Overall profit = Total selling price - Total cost price = Rs. 23600 - Rs. 23000 = Rs. 600 John made an overall profit of Rs. boxed{600} ."},{"prompt":"[ 784 + 2(14)(7) + 49 = y ]","completion":"- First, recognize the pattern in the expression: 784 = 28^2 and 49 = 7^2. - Notice that the form of the expression matches the binom recognized square formula: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. - Substitute a = 28 and b = 7 into the formula and recognize the original equation fits this pattern: [ y = 28^2 + 2(28)(7) + 7^2 ] - Calculate (28 + 7)^2 = 35^2 to find y: [ y = 35^2 = 1225 ] - Place the final answer in a box: [ boxed{1225} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the line l_{1}: x+y2=0 intersects with the line l_{2}: x2y+1=0 at point P, and line l_{1} intersects with the xaxis at point P_{1}.

Determine the correct conclusions by filling in the blank with the corresponding numbers.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships and the algebraic expressions that describe the positions of points P_n and Q_n on the lines l_1 and l_2 respectively. Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Finding P_1 and Q_1**: - The line l_1: x+y-2=0 intersects the x-axis at point P_1. Since the x-axis is described by y=0, substituting y=0 into l_1 gives x=2. Thus, P_1(2,0). - A perpendicular line to the x-axis through P_1 will have the same x-coordinate as P_1, which is x=2. Substituting x=2 into l_2: x-2y+1=0 gives 2-2y+1=0 Rightarrow y=frac{3}{2}. Thus, Q_1(2, frac{3}{2}). 2. **Finding P_2 and Q_2**: - A perpendicular line to the y-axis through Q_1 will have the same y-coordinate as Q_1, which is y=frac{3}{2}. Substituting y=frac{3}{2} into l_1 gives x+frac{3}{2}-2=0 Rightarrow x=frac{1}{2}. Thus, P_2(frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{2}). - Following the same logic, a perpendicular line to the x-axis through P_2 will have the same x-coordinate as P_2, which is x=frac{1}{2}. Substituting x=frac{1}{2} into l_2 gives frac{1}{2}-2y+1=0 Rightarrow y=frac{3}{4}. Thus, Q_2(frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{4}). Therefore, conclusion ① is boxed{text{correct}}. 3. **Analyzing the sequence {x_{n}}**: - Let P_n(x_n, y_n). Then, Q_n(x_n, frac{1}{2}x_n+frac{1}{2}) because the line l_2 can be rearranged to y=frac{1}{2}x+frac{1}{2}. This implies P_{n+1}(frac{3}{2}-frac{1}{2}x_n, frac{1}{2}x_n+frac{1}{2}) because substituting y=frac{1}{2}x_n+frac{1}{2} into l_1 gives the x-coordinate of P_{n+1}. - This leads to the relation x_{n+1}=frac{3}{2}-frac{1}{2}x_n, and rearranging gives x_{n+1}-1=-frac{1}{2}(x_n-1). Thus, {x_n-1} forms a geometric sequence with the first term 1 and common ratio -frac{1}{2}, leading to {x_n}=1+(-frac{1}{2})^{n-1}. For even n, {x_{2n}}=1+(-frac{1}{2})^{2n-1}=1-2times(frac{1}{4})^{n}, which shows that the sequence {x_{2n}} is monotonically increasing, contradicting conclusion ②. Therefore, ② is boxed{text{incorrect}}. 4. **Calculating |PP_n|^2**: - Given the intersection points of the two lines P(1,1) and P_n(x_n, 2-x_n), we find |PP_n|^2=(x_n-1)^2+(2-x_n-1)^2=2(x_n-1)^2=2times(frac{1}{4})^{n-1}. Therefore, conclusion ③ is boxed{text{correct}}. 5. **Determining the sum S_n**: - The sum of the first n terms of the sequence {x_n} is S_n=n+frac{1-(-frac{1}{2})^n}{1-(-frac{1}{2})}=n+frac{2}{3}-frac{2}{3}times(-frac{1}{2})^n.

To show this, we will use the geometric property of polar triangles in spherical geometry.

This can be expressed as: [ a_i + a_j < 20 text{for all} i,j text{with} i neq j. ] 3. **Example Distribution:** Consider the distribution: (a_1 = 10, a_2 = 9, a_3 = 8, a_4 = 7, a_5 = 5, a_6 = 1). - Verify the distinctness and sum of the candies: [ 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 1 = 40. ] - Check the pairwise sums: - (10 + 9 = 19) - (10 + 8 = 18) - (10 + 7 = 17) - (10 + 5 = 15) - (10 + 1 = 11) - (9 + 8 = 17) - (9 + 7 = 16) - (9 + 5 = 14) - (9 + 1 = 10) - (8 + 7 = 15) - (8 + 5 = 13) - (8 + 1 = 9) - (7 + 5 = 12) - (7 + 1 = 8) - (5 + 1 = 6) Since all these sums are less than 20, the given distribution meets the requirement. 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is possible to distribute 40 candies among 6 children such that each child's candies are distinct and the sum of the candies of any two children is less than half the total number of candies.

Let (S(n)) denote the sum of the decimal digits of (n). 2. **Consider the properties of (a^6 mod 9):** By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer (a), (a^6 equiv 1 pmod{9}) if (a) is not divisible by 3. This is because (a^6 equiv (a^3)^2 equiv 1^2 equiv 1 pmod{9}) for (a notequiv 0 pmod{3}). 3. **Evaluate (a^6 + 2014 mod 9):** Since (2014 equiv 8 pmod{9}), we have: [ a^6 + 2014 equiv 1 + 8 equiv 9 equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Therefore, (a^6 + 2014 equiv 0 pmod{9}) for (a) not divisible by 3. 4. **Sum of digits modulo 9:** The sum of the digits of a number (n) modulo 9 is congruent to (n mod 9).

Excluding multiples of 3, we have 16 values left (since 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 are excluded).

The absolute maximum number of moves Sasha can make is to eat all adjacent pairs of the same color. 3. **Worst-Case Layout Evaluation:** In the worst-case scenario, candies are arranged such that not all pairs can be eaten. Consider the example where there are 16 black candies placed such that no adjacent pair of black candies exists, while 33 white candies are placed such that at most 32 pairs can be eaten. Essentially, we are forced to leave out one white candy in the worst case. 4. **Determining Feasibility:** The solution implies that Sasha can always ensure to eat up to 32 candies regardless of the initial distribution. We show this by demonstrating a partitioning approach. 5. **Partitioning Approach:** Partition the 7 times 7 grid into smaller 2 times 3 rectangular sections wherever possible. In each of these 2 times 3 sections, there are three pairs of adjacent cells where Sasha could potentially eat all candies. This breakdown ensures that Sasha can eat: [ 4 text{ candies per } 2 times 3 text{ rectangle, making a total of 8 rectangles in the grid} ] 6. **Remaining Cells:** Any remaining cells not fitting within these rectangles can be linked back to ensure maximal pairs are eaten by manipulating adjacent pair conditions in corner or edge scenarios. 7. **Combination Analysis:** Checking various combinations within the 7 times 7 framework confirms eating of 32 candies in adjacent pairs regardless of initial black and white distribution. # Conclusion: After considering the worst-case scenario where the placement might adversely affect the total count of pairs that can be consumed, Sasha is guaranteed to eat at least: [ boxed{32} ] candies, satisfying the conditions of the problem.

First, let's analyze the problem. Masha wants to eat a pie with cherry, and the pies are arranged in a circle. There are: - 3 pies with rice, - 3 pies with cabbage, - 1 pie with cherry. 2. It is evident that with only one bite, Masha won't be able to determine for sure which pie is cherry unless she bites into it. Thus, she needs a strategy to minimize the number of non-cherry pies she tries. Notation and Initial Bite: 3. Let's label pies clockwise from P_1 to P_7, starting arbitrarily. Masha tries P_1, which could be either: - Cabbage, - Rice, - Cherry. 4. If P_1 is cherry, Masha is done. If not, she needs a way to infer the position of the cherry pie within the minimum number of bites. Strategy for Minimizing Bites: 5. **Case when P_1 is cabbage**: - The pies are now re-arranged in Masha’s mind as: C, C, C, Ch, R, R, R - Since the pies are identical and she can't visually distinguish them, the pie through one position counterclockwise from the bitten pie is not necessarily the cherry pie. 6. Masha now tries the pie located two positions clockwise from P_1, essentially skipping one pie. Denote this pie as P_3 (where P_1 was the initial pie): - If P_3 is cherry, Masha achieves her goal with minimal bites. - If P_3 is rice, she bites into the cherry pie next because the arrangement must be as shown: C, ?, Ch, R (other pies either rest) - If P_3 is another cabbage pie, she continues to the next clockwise pie until the cherry pie is located. 7. **Case when P_1 is rice**: - Similar logic as the cabbage scenario above; move counterclockwise or clockwise depending on initial configurations remembered. 8. **Generalization for 2N+1 pies where N is count of either cabbage or rice pies**: - If Masha finds a certain pie type, the pie positions alternate around cherry using positions relative to the maximum discrete spread of known pie types. Ensuring Strategy for large N pies: 9.

We have: (s_1 = sqrt{x^2 + 12x + 36}) (s_2 = sqrt{4x^2 - 12x + 9}) The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter of the first square is (4s_1) and the perimeter of the second square is (4s_2). The sum of the perimeters of both squares is given as 64, so we have: (4s_1 + 4s_2 = 64) Divide both sides by 4 to simplify: (s_1 + s_2 = 16) Now, let's look at the expressions for (s_1) and (s_2). Notice that (x^2 + 12x + 36) and (4x^2 - 12x + 9) are both perfect squares: (x^2 + 12x + 36 = (x + 6)^2) (4x^2 - 12x + 9 = (2x - 3)^2) So, (s_1 = x + 6) and (s_2 = 2x - 3).

Specifically, we need to show that the first two tasks could be accomplished using only a compass and straightedge, while the third cannot be completed with these tools due to the nature of the angle trisection problem. 2. For the (19^circ) angle, we aim to divide it into 19 equal parts. This task can be simplified if we can construct a (1^circ) angle, since [ frac{19^circ}{19} = 1^circ. ] One method to achieve this is to draw a circle centered at the vertex of the (19^circ) angle and mark off (18) more (19^circ) arcs around the circle, yielding [ 19 times 19^circ = 360^circ + 1^circ, ] meaning that one of the divisions will naturally be a (1^circ) section as depicted in Figure 1. ![Figure 1](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_775425c8e0c556707455g-1.jpg?height=759&width=721&top_left_y=474&top_left_x=691) 3. Similarly, for the (17^circ) angle, we can also produce every (1^circ) division: - First, draw a circle centered at the vertex of the (17^circ) angle. - Measure the arc that corresponds to (17^circ) and repeat this arc (6) times around the circle, and measure the radius of the circle twice. - Using these measurements, the angle between some constructed points will be [ 120^circ - 7 cdot 17^circ = 120^circ - 119^circ = 1^circ, ] as shown in Figure 2. ![Figure 2](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_775425c8e0c556707455g-1.jpg?height=810&width=466&top_left_y=1400&top_left_x=816) 4. The task to divide an (18^circ) angle into (18) equal (1^circ) segments is infeasible with just a compass and straightedge. To construct (1^circ) sections directly would effectively require constructing a regular pentacontagon (360-sided polygon), which is not feasible using only the classic Euclidean methods by Gauss's result. Gauss's theorem states a regular (n)-gon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if [ n = 2^k p_1 p_2 ldots p_m, ] where ( p_i ) are distinct prime Fermat numbers of the form ( 2^{2^r} + 1). Here, ( 360 = 2^3 cdot 3^2 cdot 5 ) includes ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) — prime numbers but neither is a Fermat prime.

Let's break this proof into steps for clarity: 1. Case: n=3 (Triangle) If n=3, the polygon is a triangle. It is known that if all angles of a triangle are equal, then each angle is 60^circ, making it an equilateral triangle. Therefore, a_1 = a_2 = a_3. 2. Case: n=4 (Quadrilateral) If n=4, the polygon is a quadrilateral. Since all angles are equal and each angle must be 90^circ, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. In such a rectangle: - Opposite sides are equal: ( a_1 = a_3 ) and ( a_2 = a_4 ). - According to the given condition, ( a_1 geq a_2 geq a_3 geq a_4 ), which implies ( a_1 geq a_2 ) and ( a_3 leq a_4 ). Given ( a_1 = a_3 ) and ( a_2 = a_4 ), it follows that: a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4. This confirms that our quadrilateral must actually be a square. 3. Case: General n geq 5 Assume the n-gon (A_1A_2 ldots A_n) has sides ( A_1A_2 = a_1, A_2A_3 = a_2, ldots, A_nA_1 = a_n ), and the condition, a_1 geq a_2 geq ldots geq a_n, Let’s suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists at least one side that is strictly smaller than its preceding ones. Suppose (a_i) is the first side significantly smaller than (a_{i-1}): a_1 = a_2 = ldots = a_{i-1} > a_i geq a_{i+1} geq ldots geq a_n quad text{for} quad i geq 2. Consider an S_1 which is a regular n-gon with all sides equal to (a_1), oriented so that its first side (B_1B_2) is parallel and equal to the first side of the original polygon (A_1A_2 = a_1). Here are the next steps: * The vertices A_1,, A_2,, ldots,, A_i of the original polygon will coincide with the corresponding vertices B_1,, B_2,, ldots,, B_i of the regular n-gon. * Since a_i < a_1, the vertex A_{i+1} must lie inside the segment B_iB_{i+1} on the regular n-gon, implying that A_{i+1} does not coincide with any vertex of S_1 from B_i onwards. This implies a_{i+1} lies strictly inside S_1. * Consequently, each side after A_{i+1} up to a_n cannot exceed a_i, otherwise, it would contradict the convex nature of the n-gon or repeat the process of reducing length progressively. Since a_i is strictly less than the previous repeated a_1 values, this forms a logical reduction process: a_i geq a_{i+1} geq ldots geq a_n. As we continue this reduction, each smaller section forms a similar convex configuration, again emphasizing all smaller sides within S_1 finally leading to vertex contradictions, thus confirming the necessity of equal sides for such angles to remain equal.

Specifically, there are two obtuse angles. 4. **Sides at Obtuse Angles:** Focus on the sides of the quadrilateral situated in these obtuse angles. The sum of the squares of their lengths must be less than 1, since each side's length squared is less than (frac{1}{2}): [ text{sum of squares of two sides} < 1 ] 5. **Right Triangle Property:** In any triangle, the square of the length of the side opposite an obtuse angle must be at least the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This follows from the extended Pythagorean theorem for obtuse triangles: [ c^2 > a^2 + b^2 implies c^2 geq a^2 + b^2 ] 6. **Nature of Intersected Segments:** Since (AB) and (CD) intersect, they are divided into four segments by the intersection point. The sum of the squares of the lengths of these four segments must be less than 1 according to the assumption: [ text{sum of squares of four segments} < 1 ] 7. **Division Points on Segments:** Considering the point of intersection splits each segment (AB) and (CD) into two parts, denote these parts' lengths as (x) and (1-x).

To prove our final claim, let's consider the Minkowski sum of the figures ( Phi_1 ) and ( Phi_2 ), which we denote as ( Phi_1 + Phi_2 ).

At a depth s under the sea, the pressure is given by: [ p_0 + sgamma ] where gamma is the specific weight (density) of water. 3. **Application of Boyle's Law:** Since the submarine moves the bag slowly, we can apply Boyle's Law for the air volume and pressure change: [ p_0 V = (p_0 + sgamma) V(s) ] where V(s) is the volume of the air inside the bag at depth s. 4. **Buoyant Force at Depth s:** The buoyant force F at depth s is: [ F(s) = V(s) gamma ] Using Boyle's Law to express V(s) in terms of V: [ V(s) = frac{p_0 V}{p_0 + sgamma} ] Thus, [ F(s) = gamma cdot frac{p_0 V}{p_0 + sgamma} = frac{p_0 V gamma}{p_0 + sgamma} ] Simplifying, [ F(s) = frac{p_0 V}{p_0gamma^{-1} + s} ] 5. **Calculating Work Done Against Buoyant Force:** The work W done by the submarine against the buoyant force is given by the integral: [ W = int_0^h F(s) ds = int_0^h frac{p_0 V}{p_0 gamma^{-1} + s} ds ] 6. **Substitution:** Let us substitute S = s + p_0 gamma^{-1}, then dS = ds and the integral limits change accordingly: [ s = 0 Rightarrow S = p_0 gamma^{-1} ] [ s = h Rightarrow S = h + p_0 gamma^{-1} ] Therefore, [ W = int_{p_0 gamma^{-1}}^{h + p_0 gamma^{-1}} frac{p_0 V}{S} dS ] 7. **Integration and Final Expression:** The integral, [ int frac{1}{S} dS = ln S ] So, [ W = p_0 V left[ ln S right]_{p_0 gamma^{-1}}^{h + p_0 gamma^{-1}} ] Evaluating the definite integral, [ W = p_0 V left( ln left( h + p_0 gamma^{-1} right) - ln left( p_0 gamma^{-1} right) right) = p_0 V ln left( frac{h + p_0gamma^{-1}}{p_0gamma^{-1}} right) ] Simplifying, [ W = p_0 V ln left( frac{gamma h + p_0}{p_0} right) ] **Conclusion:** The work done by the submarine to pull the bag to a depth h is: [ boxed{p_0 V ln left( frac{gamma h + p_0}{p_0} right)} ]"},{"prompt":"right triangle ABC with angle B = 90^circ, points P and Q are the feet of the perpendiculars from C to overline{AB} and from B to overline{AC}, respectively.

A hexagon has 6 vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 6 to form a line segment (either a side or a diagonal) is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = frac{6!}{2!4!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15 ] Out of these 15 line segments, 6 are the sides of the hexagon. Therefore, the number of diagonals is: [ 15 - 6 = 9 ] 2. **Counting the Intersection Points of Extended Lines and Diagonals:** Extending the 6 sides and 9 diagonals of the hexagon, we form 15 line segments. The number of intersection points formed by choosing 2 out of these 15 lines (representing an intersection) is: [ binom{15}{2} = frac{15!}{2!(15-2)!} = frac{15!}{2!13!} = frac{15 times 14}{2 times 1} = 105 ] However, not all these intersections are unique as some occur at the vertices of the hexagon.

The origins of Ashutoshia can be traced back to several ancient tribes and city-states that settled in the region over 3,000 years ago. The five main tribes in the early history of Ashutoshia were the Ashu-ni, Tos-hu, Ta-sho, O-shi, and Ania tribes. Each tribe had its own distinct language, cultural practices, and way of life. The tribes occupied vast territories within the region and prided themselves on their skills in agriculture, trade, and craftsmanship. In 800 AD, a great leader by the name of Ashutosh the Unifier from the Ashu-ni tribe emerged. Ashutosh, who was known for his wisdom, diplomacy, and military resolve, began a series of diplomatic and military campaigns against the other four tribes. Through a combination of strategic alliances, warfare, and diplomacy, he successfully united the five tribes into a single, powerful kingdom which he named the State of Ashutoshia. This newly formed kingdom, with its capital named Ashu-tara, began to flourish economically, socially, and militarily due to the pooling of knowledge, resources, and skills of the five tribes. Over the next few centuries, the State of Ashutoshia became a guiding force in the region. Its trade networks extended over land and sea, connecting Ashutoshia to global markets and resources. Great thinkers, scholars, and artists of the time flocked to Ashu-tara, making it an intellectual capital that attracted attention even from beyond the region. However, Ashutoshia faced its first major decline around 1300 AD as internal strife between aristocratic families, coupled with increasing pressure from external forces, crippled the once-thriving state. Corruption and greed had taken the place of unity, causing a turmoiled political landscape engulfed by a power vacuum. In 1450, a new dynasty emerged from the chaos under the leadership of Queen Anaira, who hailed from the Ania tribe. Anaira and her descendants were able to reestablish stability and prosperity in the kingdom through her visionary policies, such as investing in education, infrastructure, and strengthening the military. The State of Ashutoshia entered what would come to be known as its \\"Golden Age.\\" The Golden Age saw numerous advancements in the fields of science, technology, literature, and the arts. Discoveries in astronomy, mathematics, and medicine were part of the intellectual wave that shaped the state during this era. Great, magnificent structures such as the \\"Anaira Palace\\" were built to show the might and cultural prowess of the Ashutoshia state. However, this period of prosperity was not destined to last indefinitely. By the early 19th century, the rise of larger, technologically advanced European powers had begun to cast a shadow on the geopolitical importance of the State of Ashutoshia. In 1827, the state fell under the colonial rule of a foreign power. For nearly a century, Ashutoshia was governed by the intrusive policies and harsh economic measures of its colonial ruler. It wasn't until 1910 that revolutionary fervor led by intellectuals, artists, and progressive thinkers ignited a struggle for independence that lasted more than two decades. In 1935, under the leadership of the charismatic and diplomatic Prime Minister, Ashok Aryavarta, the newly-formed United Ashutoshian Liberation Army managed to successfully force the withdrawal of the foreign regime from Ashutoshian territory. In the post-colonial years, the leaders of Ashutoshia decided to form a united government, combining the best elements of their diverse tribal past into a united, modern state. Thus, on July 9th, 1943, the United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia was officially founded as a federal parliamentary democracy. The capital was established in the newly-built city of Shanti-tara - the \\"City of Peace\\" - as a symbol of unification, progress, and a new era for the Ashutoshian people. Since its inauguration, Ashutoshia has made great strides in economic growth, technological innovation, and social development. Today, Ashutoshia is known and respected as both a regional and global player, embodying the resilience and unity that harkens back to its ancient roots. The country celebrates its rich heritage and unique cultural traditions, while continuously looking forward to a bright and promising future for its people."},{"prompt":"I have created a stock market prediction model based on super indication now in this you need give code to make predictions for upcoming prices for next 5 days using the model also in y axis insted of time make it date: import yfinance as yf import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM from keras.callbacks import LambdaCallback nifty = yf.download('^NSEI', start='2009-01-01', end='2021-01-01') def supertrend(df, period=10, multiplier=3): hl = (df['High'] + df['Low']) / 2 atr = df['High'].rolling(period).max() - df['Low'].rolling(period).min() up = hl - multiplier * atr dn = hl + multiplier * atr df['ST'] = 0 df['ST'][0] = (df['High'][0] + df['Low'][0]) / 2 position = 'none' for i in range(1, len(df)): if df['Close'][i] > up[i]: if position != 'buy': position = 'buy' df['ST'][i] = dn[i] else: df['ST'][i] = max(df['ST'][i - 1], dn[i]) elif df['Close'][i] < dn[i]: if position != 'sell': position = 'sell' df['ST'][i] = up[i] else: df['ST'][i] = min(df['ST'][i - 1], up[i]) else: df['ST'][i] = df['ST'][i - 1] return df nifty = supertrend(nifty) nifty.head() dataset = nifty['Close'].values dataset = dataset.astype('float32') dataset = dataset.reshape(-1, 1) scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) dataset = scaler.fit_transform(dataset) # convert an array of values into a dataset matrix def create_dataset(dataset, look_back=1): dataX, dataY = [], [] for i in range(len(dataset)-look_back-1): a = dataset[i:(i+look_back), 0] dataX.append(a) dataY.append(dataset[i + look_back, 0]) return np.array(dataX), np.array(dataY) train_size = int(len(dataset) * 0.8) test_size = len(dataset) - train_size train, test = dataset[:train_size], dataset[train_size:] look_back = 1 trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back) testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back) trainX = np.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], 1, trainX.shape[1])) testX = np.reshape(testX, (testX.shape[0], 1, testX.shape[1])) model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(100, input_shape=(1, look_back))) model.add(Dense(1)) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') model.fit(trainX, trainY, epochs=200, batch_size=1, verbose=0) trainPredict = model.predict(trainX) testPredict = model.predict(testX) trainPredict = scaler.inverse_transform(trainPredict) trainY = scaler.inverse_transform([trainY]) testPredict = scaler.inverse_transform(testPredict) testY = scaler.inverse_transform([testY]) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt trainPredictPlot = np.empty_like(dataset) trainPredictPlot[:, :] = np.nan trainPredictPlot[look_back:len(trainPredict)+look_back, :] = trainPredict testPredictPlot = np.empty_like(dataset) testPredictPlot[:, :] = np.nan testPredictPlot[len(trainPredict)+(look_back*2)+1:len(dataset)-1, :] = testPredict plt.plot(scaler.inverse_transform(dataset), label='Actual') plt.plot(trainPredictPlot, label='Train Prediction') plt.plot(testPredictPlot, label='Test Prediction') plt.legend() plt.show() model.save('my_model.h5')","completion":"To make predictions for the upcoming prices for the next 5 days using the model, you need to add the following code at the end of your script: \`\`\`python # Function to predict the next 'n' days prices def predict_next_n_days(model, data, n): predictions = [] data = np.array(data[-1 * look_back:]) for _ in range(n): pred = model.predict(data.reshape(1, 1, look_back)) data = np.concatenate((data[1:], pred), axis=0) predictions.append(pred) return scaler.inverse_transform(predictions) # Predict the next 5 days prices num_days = 5 predicted_prices = predict_next_n_days(model, dataset, num_days) # Add the predicted dates import datetime last_date_in_data = nifty.index[-1] predicted_dates = [last_date_in_data + datetime.timedelta(days=i) for i in range(1, num_days + 1)] # Plot the predictions plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5)) plt.plot(nifty.index, scaler.inverse_transform(dataset), label='Actual') plt.plot(predicted_dates, predicted_prices, label='Predicted', marker='o') plt.xlabel('Date') plt.ylabel('Price') plt.legend() plt.show() \`\`\` This code will plot the predicted prices for the next 5 days with dates on the x-axis.

Es wurde am 17. Mai 2007 bei den Filmfestspielen von Cannes uraufgeführt. Angesiedelt im späten kommunistischen Rumänien unter Diktator Nicolae Ceaușescu, handelt es von der Angst und Erniedrigung, die mit dem Leben in einer Diktatur einhergehen. Als erster rumänischer Film wurde das Werk mit der Goldenen Palme ausgezeichnet und erhielt zudem den Europäischen Filmpreis und den Grand Prix de la FIPRESCI. Ebenso fand es große Zustimmung bei der Kritik, weil es mit einem nüchternen formalen Stil eine außerordentliche, fast unerträgliche Spannung entwickle. Mungiu veranstaltete in Rumänien, wo es 2008 kaum Kinos gab, eine Tournee mit einer mobilen Projektionsanlage, um das Werk dort auf die Leinwand zu bringen.', 'Inhalt.', 'Geschichtliche Ausgangslage: Rumänien unter Ceaușescu.', 'Der historische Hintergrund, vor dem sich die Handlung abspielt, wird im Film nicht direkt erläutert. Im kommunistischen Rumänien kam 1965 Nicolae Ceaușescu an die Macht, der sich Moskau nicht unterordnete, das Land auf einen nationalen Sonderweg führte und einen extremen Führerkult pflegte. Die Bespitzelung der Bevölkerung durch den Geheimdienst Securitate war total, die Wirtschaftslage miserabel. Im Unterschied zu anderen mitteleuropäischen Volksrepubliken, in denen sich eine freiheitliche Sexualmoral und Familienpolitik durchsetzte, griff Ceaușescus Ideologie vom nationalen Bevölkerungswachstum mit strengen Vorschriften (Dekret 770) tief ins Privatleben hinein. Verhütungsmittel wurden nicht angeboten, und auf Schwangerschaftsabbruch standen mehrere Jahre Gefängnis. Dennoch wurde er weithin von Laien im Verborgenen unter prekären Bedingungen durchgeführt, was zum Tod von etwa 10.000 Frauen geführt haben soll. Bei unerwarteten Komplikationen kam es vor, dass die Polizei der Frau den Zugang zum Krankenhaus verwehrte, solange sie die Beteiligten nicht nannte. Nach Ceaușescus Sturz 1989 war eine der ersten Gesetzesänderungen die Aufhebung des Abtreibungsverbots.', 'Handlung.', 'Die Filmfachzeitschrift \\"Positif\\" gab dem Leser die – in solchen Zeitschriften sonst selten ausgesprochene – Empfehlung, vor dem Kinobesuch nichts über den Film zu lesen.

Die Studentinnen Găbița und Otilia teilen sich ein Zimmer im Studentenwohnheim, wo ein reger Schwarzhandel mit Kosmetika und Zigaretten stattfindet. Für den Abend haben sie etwas vor, über das sie nicht offen reden. Während Găbița zaudert, treibt Otilia die Vorbereitungen voran. An der Uni leiht sich Otilia noch etwas Geld von ihrem Freund Adi, der darauf besteht, dass sie am Abend zu der Geburtstagsfeier seiner Mutter mitkommt. Sie windet sich, ohne ihren mit Găbița verfolgten Plan offenzulegen, und verspricht dem beharrlichen Adi schließlich, zu kommen. Weil sich eine von Găbița vorgenommene Zimmerreservierung im von ihr vorgesehenen Hotel als gescheitert erweist, muss Otilia in einem anderen Hotel bei der Empfangsdame mühsam ein Zimmer erbetteln. Anschließend holt sie den ihr unbekannten Herrn Bebe ab, mit dem eigentlich Găbița verabredet ist. Diese ist inzwischen im Hotelzimmer eingetroffen, wo sich nun die zentrale Sequenz des Films abspielt.', 'Găbița ist schwanger und will trotz des strengen Verbots abtreiben. Bei der ersten Untersuchung stellt der illegale Abtreibungen vornehmende Bebe fest, dass sie nicht wie behauptet im zweiten, sondern schon im vierten Monat schwanger ist. Die Studentinnen haben weniger Geld dabei, als Bebe erwartet. In einem erpresserischen, erniedrigenden Feilschen erreicht der Mann, dass zusätzlich zur finanziellen Vergütung beide Frauen mit ihm schlafen. Als er sich im Bad aufhält, entdeckt Otilia in seinem Koffer ein Klappmesser und nimmt es an sich. Bebe sterilisiert seine mitgebrachten Utensilien und führt Găbița eine Sonde ein. Bis zur Ausstoßung des Fötus muss sie im Bett liegen bleiben, was zwei Stunden, aber auch zwei Tage dauern könne. Nachdem Bebe gegangen ist, bricht Otilia zur Geburtstagsfeier der Mutter ihres Freundes auf und lässt Găbița allein zurück. Die Rezeptionistin weist sie darauf hin, dass Bebe seinen Ausweis im Hotel vergessen hat. Bei Adis Eltern und deren Freunden findet sie keine innere Ruhe, da sie Găbița telefonisch nicht erreicht, und verlässt die Feier vorzeitig.', 'Als sie wieder im Hotel bei Găbița ankommt, hat diese die Ausstoßung schon hinter sich. Găbița liegt im Bett und der Fötus im Bad auf dem Boden. Die vom Anblick entsetzte Otilia packt ihn in ihre Tasche und bricht in die Nacht auf, um ihn irgendwo in einen Müllschlucker zu werfen. Zurück im Hotel, klopft sie vergeblich an die Zimmertür. Vor dem Hotel steht ein Krankenwagen, wie sich herausstellt wegen einer Schlägerei und nicht wegen Găbița, die im Hotelrestaurant sitzt. Otilia schlägt vor, über das Vorgefallene nie wieder zu reden.', 'Themenkreise.', 'Leben in der Diktatur.', 'Der Film thematisiert nicht Einzelheiten der Politik Ceaușescus, sondern das entstandene Klima. Statt auf eine große, aber unpersönliche Geschichtserzählung zu setzen, schildert Mungiu präzise den Alltag aus subjektiver Perspektive. Der Name Ceaușescu fällt nie, das Konterfei des Diktators ist nie zu sehen. Seine Ära sollte gemäß Mungiu den Hintergrund der Erzählung bilden, nicht aber deren Thema, um den üblichen Klischees politischer Filme auszuweichen. Es herrscht eine stickige Atmosphäre in einer verlogenen, polizeilichen, kleinbürgerlichen und burlesk machistischen Gesellschaft. Die graue, freudlose Stimmung im Land geht auch vom Verhalten der Menschen aus. In der Öffentlichkeit fühlt man sich beobachtet und bemüht sich, kein Aufsehen zu erregen – kein Lachen, kein Scherzen, keine auffällige Kleidung. Weil Missbräuche nicht geahndet werden können, gehören sie zum Leben. Die Erzählung veranschaulicht, wie sehr der Einzelne den totalitären Strukturen ausgeliefert ist. Das System beruhte nicht allein auf der Geheimpolizei, sondern auch auf jenen Bürgern, denen es ein Stück Autorität über andere überließ. Der Alltag und die zwischenmenschlichen Verhältnisse sind fast vollständig von Abhängigkeiten, Korruption und Erpressung geprägt, und jene, die ein Stückchen Macht besitzen, kosten es aus, um die anderen zu erniedrigen. Das führt beispielsweise dazu, dass Otilia der Rezeptionistin als Autoritätsperson ihr Kommen und Gehen zu melden und ihre persönlichen Angelegenheiten zu erklären hat.', 'Mungiu selbst sieht eine Mehrzahl möglicher Interpretationen seines Films – Systemmetapher, Überlebensgeschichte, existenzielles Gleichnis – keine sei falsch. Für ihn sind die persönlichen Entscheidungen wesentlich. Die meisten Menschen sehen nicht über den Tag hinaus und bedenken nicht die Folgen ihres Handelns. Das treffe noch heute auf viele Rumänen zu. Weil der Staat das Kindergebären verordnet hatte, fassten die Rumänen die Abtreibung nicht als persönlichen, moralischen Entscheid auf und waren lediglich besorgt, nicht erwischt zu werden. „Das Schlimmste, was das Regime in uns bewirkt hat, war die Beeinflussung unseres Denkens dahin, dass wir bei Entscheidungen die moralische Dimension nicht erwägen. Das ist eine unterschwellige, schädliche Vereinnahmung. Ich brauchte Jahre, um mir bewusst zu werden, dass der Kampf gegen den Kommunismus nicht nur ein Kampf um die Freiheit selbst war, sondern auch um frei denken zu lernen.“', 'Dass eine Deutung des Films in parteilichen Begriffen der Abtreibungsfrage falsch wäre, befanden mehrere Rezensenten des Films. Die Beweggründe, die zahlreiche Rumäninnen zum Schwangerschaftsabbruch führten, lagen in der prekären Wirtschaftslage und Lebensmittelversorgung, hatten mithin nichts mit persönlicher Entscheidungsfreiheit zu tun. Mungiu zählt sich selbst zu jenen „Dekretkindern“, die ohne die repressiven Gesetze nicht auf die Welt gekommen wären. Er wollte sein Werk nicht als Anti-Abtreibungsfilm verstanden wissen und betonte, dass er sich der Stellungnahme enthalte. Sein Film sei vielmehr eine Hommage an jene Frauen, die trotz der Repression den Mut hatten, eine Schwangerschaft abzubrechen; viele fassten es als Akt des Widerstandes gegen das Regime auf.', 'Eine Frauenfreundschaft und herablassende Männer.', 'Obwohl es Găbița ist, die schwanger ist, nimmt Otilia die Sache an die Hand – in ihr stecken Antrieb und Schwung, sie ist es, die Angst erträgt und Mut hat, Risiken eingeht, für Găbița denkt und redet, „an die Front geht wie ein kleiner Soldat, während der andere in Deckung bleibt.“ Găbița ist unselbständig, weltfremd, unzuverlässig, verantwortungslos und anspruchsvoll. Sie neigt zu bequemen Lügen und ist ansonsten nicht im Stande, außerhalb der vom Regime vorgegebenen Muster zu agieren. Ein Kritiker stellte fest, dass sie genau wisse, wie sie von Otilia Mitleid erheischen kann, ein anderer fand sie sehr unsympathisch und von seltener Niedertracht. Der Filmtitel trägt eine zu denkende Fortschreibung in sich, die \\"1 Stunde\\" lauten müsste. Als Otilia zur Geburtstagsfeier aufbricht, verspricht sie Găbița, in einer Stunde zurück zu sein. In dieser Stunde ist Găbița in Einsamkeit einer existenziellen Erfahrung ausgesetzt, bei der sie sterben könnte. Dass sie sich zuletzt selbstständig ins Restaurant begibt, wirft die Frage auf, inwieweit sie sich entwickelt hat. Nach Mungiu hat sie nach dem Durchgemachten Energie und Appetit bekommen.', 'In „eine[r] der unausgewogensten Freundschaften der Filmgeschichte“ erbringt Otilia einen Dienst, der sie beinahe zur Erschöpfung führt. Für die \\"Cahiers du cinéma\\" zeugte Otilias Wagemut von einer festen Freundschaft, deren Găbița nicht würdig: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Sie gilt als die \\"Seele des Silbernen Zeitalters\\" in der russischen Literatur und als bedeutende russische Dichterin. Ihr späteres Schaffen ist vor allem von den Schrecken der stalinistischen Herrschaft geprägt, während der sie selbst Schreibverbot hatte, ihr Sohn und ihr Mann inhaftiert waren und viele ihrer Freunde ums Leben kamen.', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit und Jugend.', 'Anna Gorenko wurde am 23. Juni 1889 in dem Dorf Bolschoi Fontan bei Odessa als drittes von sechs Kindern in die Familie eines Marine-Ingenieurs geboren; die Familie übersiedelte aber bereits 1890 nach Zarskoje Selo bei Sankt Petersburg, wo Anna bis zu ihrem 16. Lebensjahr in sozial privilegierter Umgebung aufwuchs. Sie beschrieb später ihre Kindheitserinnerungen an die Parks, die Pferderennbahn und den alten Bahnhof des Ortes. Die Sommermonate verbrachte die Familie meist bei Sewastopol am Schwarzen Meer. Früh lernte sie in der Schule auch Französisch. Ihre ersten Gedichte schrieb sie im Alter von elf Jahren nicht unter dem Namen Gorenko, da ihr Vater um seinen guten Ruf fürchtete – sie wählte den Namen ihres bulgarischen Urgroßvaters Chan Achmat als Pseudonym.', 'Wie Puschkin 90 Jahre vor ihr erhielt Achmatowa ihre Schulausbildung im exklusiven Lyzeum von Zarskoje Selo. Ihr Verhältnis zu dem wichtigsten russischen Dichter zieht sich von Beginn an wie ein roter Faden durch ihre Arbeiten: Im September 1911, zum 100-jährigen Jubiläum des Lyzeums, verfasste sie ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \\"Der dunkelhäutige Knabe schlenderte durch die Alleen\\", in dem es Anspielungen auf den jungen Puschkin gibt. Bereits in diesem Gedicht wird die typische Metonymietechnik der Achmatowa deutlich: Ohne Lyzeum und Puschkin beim Namen zu nennen, wird durch typische Eigenschaften und Gegenstände (hier: dunkelhäutig, der Lyzeums-Dreispitz usw.) klar, wer und was gemeint ist.', 'Nachdem ihre Eltern sich 1905 getrennt hatten, lebte sie mit ihrer Mutter und den Geschwistern ein Jahr lang in Jewpatorija auf der Krim. Das letzte Schuljahr verbrachte sie schließlich am Kiewer Funduklejew-Gymnasium. Von 1907 bis 1910 studierte Achmatowa in Kiew in „Höheren Frauenkursen“ Jura, wobei sie sich vor allem für die Grundkurse in Rechtsgeschichte und Latein interessierte und den rein juristischen Fachthemen gleichgültig gegenüberstand.', 'Im Jahr 1910 heiratete sie den Dichter Nikolai Gumiljow, den sie schon seit ihrer Schulzeit kannte und der ihr lange und verzweifelt den Hof gemacht hatte. Es folgten gemeinsame Reisen nach Paris und Italien, wo sie u. a. den Künstler Modigliani traf – seine Zeichnungen der Achmatowa sind später berühmt geworden – und Zeugin der ersten triumphalen Erfolge der russischen Balletttänzer in Westeuropa wurde. Malerei und Architektur Italiens beeindruckten sie tief.', 'Vor der Revolution.', 'Achmatowa, Gumiljow und Ossip Mandelstam wurden zu den zentralen Vertretern der Literaturbewegung des Akmeismus (von griech. \\"akme\\", Gipfel, Höhepunkt, Blütezeit). Die so genannte „Zeche“ um diese Dichter bildete eine Gegenströmung zum Symbolismus, dessen Metaphorik des Jenseitigen, Metaphysischen die Akmeisten eine eigene Poesie jedes „irdischen Dings“ und eine entschiedene Diesseitigkeit entgegensetzten. Achmatowas Gedichte zeichnen sich daher durch eine einfache und prägnante Sprache aus. Anders als bei den „esoterisch“ angehauchten Treffen der Symbolisten waren die Zusammenkünfte der Akmeisten eher „Workshops“, in denen u. a. neue Schreibtechniken erarbeitet wurden.', 'Neben Puschkin fand Achmatowa ihre dichterischen Wurzeln bei Innokenti Annenski (1856–1909), einem Vorläufer der Akmeisten, außerdem bei dem französischen Symbolisten Verlaine und dem jungen Majakowski.', 'Nach ihrer Rückkehr nach Sankt Petersburg studierte Achmatowa Literaturgeschichte und schrieb die Gedichte, die in ihren ersten Gedichtband \\"Abend\\" (, 1912) eingingen. Es waren vor allem Liebesgedichte, in denen sie Trennung, Kummer und Liebesleid beschrieb wie beispielsweise in der letzten Strophe ihres Gedichtes „Lied von der letzten Begegnung“:', 'Sie verwendete in ihren lakonischen, knappen Gedichten Alltagssprache, in denen Gefühle gestisch angedeutet werden. Ein linker Handschuh, der aus Versehen auf die rechte Hand gestreift wird, wird zum Ausdruck der Verzweiflung und Verwirrtheit der Beschriebenen, die äußerlich ruhig bleibt:', 'Im Oktober 1912 wurde Achmatowas einziger Sohn Lew geboren. Schon 1914 erschien ihr zweites Buch, \\"Rosenkranz\\" (), das trotz der Ereignisse des beginnenden Weltkrieges, wie schon der erste Band, ein großer Erfolg wurde. Diese Sammlung enthielt auch das im Januar 1914 entstandene Gedicht \\"Für Alexander Blok\\" (), ein Indiz für ihre enge Beziehung zu dem Dichter des Symbolismus, die sie immer wieder als platonisch, „ausschließlich poetisch“ bezeichnete. Auch von Alexander Blok gibt es eine Reihe von Gedichten, die der Achmatowa gewidmet sind (z. B. \\"An Anna Achmatowa\\", ). Ihre erste Begegnung hatte 1913 stattgefunden. Während der Symbolist in seinen Gedichten über Weiblichkeit und Schönheit sinnierte, wählte Achmatowa ihren gewohnt sparsamen, nüchternen Stil: „Ich habe den Dichter besucht. Gerade Mittag. Sonntag. Das Zimmer geräumig. Vor den Fenstern Frost.“ Allerdings schildert das unmittelbar vor diesem im \\"Rosenkranz\\" gedruckte Gedicht (\\"Der Gast\\",, Januar 1914) eine zärtliche Begegnung mit einem Mann, dessen Schilderung auf Blok zutraf. Diese Übereinstimmungen führten gelegentlich zu der Vermutung, dass die Beziehung der beiden Dichter intimer war als offiziell bekannt.', 'Auch der nächste Gedichtband, \\"Die weiße Schar\\" (), fiel bei seinem Erscheinen 1917 in eine historisch unruhige Zeit. Die chaotischen Zustände zu Beginn der Revolution schmälerten den Verkaufserfolg des Buches.', 'Repressionen in der jungen Sowjetunion.', 'Nach der Oktoberrevolution arbeitete Achmatowa als Bibliothekarin im Landwirtschaftlichen Institut. Von 1922 an bis 1940 wurden ihre Gedichte nicht mehr gedruckt, da sie den kommunistischen Machthabern zu wenig gesellschaftlich relevant, zu privat waren. In der Sowjetenzyklopädie hieß es, ihre Gedichte seien mit religiös-mystischen und erotischen Motiven überladen, mit denen sie die Jugend vergifte. Ihre älteren Werke fanden nur unter der Hand im Samisdat Verbreitung. Lew Kopelew schrieb über sie: \\"Ihre Verse blieben im Gedächtnis haften, wurden je nach Stimmung wieder hervorgeholt … Damals war man noch bereit zuzugestehen, daß auch Klassenfeinde und unversöhnliche weltanschauliche Gegner selbstlos, edelmütig und tapfer sein konnten. Ein derartiger „liberaler Objektivismus“ war noch keine Todsünde, noch keine Straftat.\\"', 'Ihr Ehemann Gumiljow, von dem sie sich 1918 hatte scheiden lassen, wurde 1921 wegen angeblicher konterrevolutionärer Aktivitäten erschossen.', 'Dem Mosaizist Boris Anrep, dem sie sehr nahestand, wollte sie nicht ins westliche Ausland folgen, weil sie sich nicht vorstellen konnte, ihre Heimat und ihr Volk zu verlassen. Ihre nächste Liebe, der Literaturkritiker Nedobrowo, starb 1919 an Schwindsucht. Nach einer zweiten, von 1918 bis 1922 dauernden und unglücklich verlaufenden Ehe mit dem Assyriologen und Übersetzer Wladimir Schileiko (1891–1930), der ihre Gedichte zum Teil verbrannt haben soll, lebte sie ab 1926 bis 1938 mit dem Kunsthistoriker Nikolai Nikolajewitsch Punin (1888–1953) zusammen, wobei das Paar zum Teil in einer angespannten Situation in einer Wohnung mit Punins Noch-Ehefrau und deren Tochter wohnte. Oftmals lebte Achmatowa in dieser Zeit buchstäblich von Brot und Tee, wobei sie ihr Selbstbewusstsein und ihren eigenen Stil nie aufgab.', '1930 bis zum Ausbruch des Krieges.', 'Sowohl ihr Sohn Lew als auch ihr Ehemann Nikolai Punin wurden in den 1930er Jahren mehrfach verhaftet. Ihr Sohn wurde nach dem anfänglichen Todesurteil in die Verbannung geschickt und erst im April 1956, drei Jahre nach Stalins Tod, endgültig nach Hause entlassen. Insgesamt verbrachte er anderthalb Jahrzehnte in Lagerhaft. Ihr Ehemann Nikolai Punin starb 1953 im Arbeitslager Workuta.', 'In der Zeit der Inhaftierung ihres Sohnes verbrachte Achmatowa viel Zeit in den Warteschlangen der Angehörigen vor dem Gefängnis. In \\"Requiem\\", das sie in dieser Zeit zu schreiben begann und das ein einziges Klagelied gegen den Stalin-Terror ist, schrieb sie anstelle eines Vorworts folgenden kurzen Prosatext:', 'Für Achmatowa waren diese Jahre ein nicht endender Albtraum. Sie rechnete stets damit, dass an ihrem Sohn das Todesurteil vollstreckt wurde. Die neben Achmatowa andere bedeutende russische Lyrikerin des 20. Jahrhunderts, Marina Zwetajewa, die Achmatowa mit dem Zitat „Anna von ganz Russland“ ehrte, erhängte sich 1941 völlig verarmt. Freunde verschwanden, darunter ihr jahrelanger Wegbegleiter Ossip Mandelstam, der während seiner Verhöre in der Lubjanka im Jahre 1934 seine Gedichte über Stalin sogar für seine Folterknechte niederschrieb. Trotzdem wurde er nicht wie damals üblich in den Gulag geschickt, sondern von Stalin, dem der Dichter zur damaligen Zeit tot gefährlicher gewesen wäre als lebendig, versucht ihn \\"zu isolieren, aber am Leben zu erhalten\\". Die Mandelstams wurden daraufhin ins Exil nach Woronesch, 400 km südlich von Moskau, verbannt und durften 1937 wieder ins Moskauer Gebiet – wenn auch nicht in die Hauptstadt selbst – zurückkehren. Im Herbst desselben Jahres besuchten die Mandelstams Achmatowa im Fontänenhaus in Leningrad, wo sie auf dem Sofa ihres Zimmers schlafen mussten, da sie keine eigene Unterkunft hatten. Achmatowa schrieb während dieses letzten Besuches der beiden ein Gedicht für Ossip Mandelstam, den sie wie einen Zwillingsbruder ansah.

Diese konnte auf die von den Adelsgesellschaften geschaffene Infrastruktur zurückgreifen.', 'Abgrenzung und Einordnung des Begriffs „Adelsgesellschaft“.', 'Adelsgesellschaften als Besonderheit des Heiligen Römischen Reiches.', 'In der angelsächsischen Literatur hat Boulton eine Systematik der westeuropäischen Adelsvereinigungen erarbeitet. Er unterscheidet grob „Echte Orden \\"(true orders)\\"“, die von einem Monarchen oder Fürsten initiiert wurden, und „Pseudoorden \\"(pseudo orders)\\"“, bei denen die Initiative zum Zusammenschluss von den Mitgliedern ausging, die sich aber dennoch, mit oder ohne Eid, einem Förderer unterstellten.', 'Bei dem Versuch, diese Systematik für die Erstellung eines Repertoriums zur Klassifizierung der deutschen Adelsgesellschaften heranzuziehen, fanden Kruse, Paravicini und Ranft Boultons Klassifikation nicht praktikabel, da sie dem „…schillernden und wandelbaren Charakter…“ der von ihnen beobachteten Gesellschaften nicht gerecht werde. Als schillernd bezeichnen sie zum Beispiel die Gesellschaft \\"St. Antonius (Kleve)\\"., die eine Gebetsverbrüderung, ein Hoforden und Förderer des Antoniterordens und schließlich eine Schützenbruderschaft gewesen sei. Als wandelbar bezeichnen sie den \\"Falken\\", der sich aus einer an politischen Zielen orientierten Vereinigung zu einer Turniergesellschaft, oder den \\"Drachen\\", der sich vom Hoforden zum Ehrenzeichen gewandelt habe. Sie vermuten, dass solche genossenschaftlichen Vereinigungen im Spätmittelalter in Deutschland, im Vergleich zu anderen Regionen Europas, besonders häufig anzutreffen waren, weil sich hier kein an einem einzelnen Monarchen ausgerichteter Zentralstaat ausgebildet hatte. Sie identifizieren 92 Gesellschaften, die hinsichtlich ihrer Struktur (Eid, Statuten, genossenschaftliche Organisation …) Gemeinsamkeiten aufwiesen. Angesichts der mageren Überlieferung nehmen sie an, dennoch nur einen Bruchteil der tatsächlichen Gesellschaften erfasst zu haben.', 'Der römisch-deutsche König hatte, im Gegensatz zu den Königen von England, Frankreich oder Spanien, keine eigene Gesellschaft. Die Gesellschaften, in denen deutsche Könige anzutreffen sind, waren Gesellschaften ihrer Stammherrschaften. Der \\"Drache\\" war ungarisch, der \\"Adler\\" österreichisch, und „Tusin“ böhmisch. Die deutschen Kaiser und Könige betrieben eine flexible Politik im Spannungsfeld Kaiser/König–Fürsten–Adel–Städte, die vom generellen Verbot von Adelsgesellschaften in der Goldenen Bulle Karls IV. 1356, über punktuelle Verbote, bis zur Billigung und Förderung durch König Sigmund 1422/1431 reichte. Friedrich III. verfolgte eine opportunistische Politik, die sowohl Verbot als auch Förderung umfasste. Sein Sohn Maximilian betrieb eine aktive Förderung, um ein königs-/kaisertreues Gegengewicht gegen die Fürsten zu fördern.', 'Abgrenzung vom Begriff „Orden“.', 'Viele der Bezeichnungen für einzelne Adelsgesellschaften sind nicht zeitgenössisch. Dies gilt auch für die Oberbegriffe. So nannten sich nur \\"St. Antonius\\", \\"Pelikan\\" und \\"St. Hubertus\\" tatsächlich selbst Orden. „Schwanenorden“ ist hingegen eine Bezeichnung des 19. Jahrhunderts – ursprünglich nannte sich die Vereinigung „Gesellschaft unserer lieben Frau“. Ebenso verhielt es sich beim \\"Drachenorden\\", der in der Stiftungsurkunde gar nicht benannt wurde und später als \\"gesellschaft mit dem trakchen\\", \\"societas Draconis\\" oder \\"Gesellschaft des (Lind-)Wurms\\" bezeichnet wurde.', 'Abgrenzung vom Begriff „Turniergesellschaft“.', 'Der Begriff „Turniergesellschaft“ ist für eine allgemeine Bezeichnung ebenfalls zu eng. Diese Bezeichnung geht zurück auf die Beschäftigung mit Turnier- und Wappenbüchern im 19. und frühen 20. Jahrhundert. Anhand dort gefundener Eintragungen wurde versucht, Mitgliederverzeichnisse von Turniergesellschaften zu erfassen. Da die Kenntnisse der Herolde, die solche Turnier- und Wappenbücher erstellten, begrenzt und oft von regionalen Vorlieben beeinflusst waren oder, wie im Falle Rüxners deutlich wird, auch nachträgliche Konstruktionen darstellten, sind solche Zusammenstellungen willkürlich. Eine jede „…Liste fügt unter Weglassung alter Namen neue hinzu.“ In dem vom Kruse, Paravicini und Ranft erstellten Repertorium sind nur 24 der 92 aufgezeichneten Gesellschaften, entweder wegen einer Selbstbezeichnung in ihren Statuten oder wegen einer Erwähnung in Turnier- und Wappenbüchern, als Turniergesellschaften bezeichnet. Besonders bei den frühen Gesellschaften des 14. Jahrhunderts fehlt die Zuordnung als Turniergesellschaft ganz. Die \\"Gesellschaft von 1361\\" wird in der Literatur als Turniergesellschaft bezeichnet, war aber eine politische Vereinigung ober- und niederbayerischer Adeliger zur Beeinflussung des labilen Herzogs Meinrad. 1362 entstand ein adeliger Gegenbund, der die Wittelsbacher Ruprecht I. und Ruprecht II., Pfalzgrafen bei Rhein, Stephan II., Herzog von Bayern-Landshut, und Johann II. unterstützte gegen jene, die Meinrad „…seinen landen und läuten, rittern und knechten, steten un märgten, reichen und armen enpfrümpt und enpfürt habent…“. Mit dem Tod Meinrads verschwanden sowohl die Gesellschaft als auch das Gegenbündnis.', 'Auch andere sogenannte Turniergesellschaften hatten vorwiegend politische Motive. Die Gesellschaft des Rüdenbandes firmierte laut Statut als Turniergesellschaft, wurde aber von Wenzel von Breslau genutzt, um seine Nachfolge durch seinen Neffen Ludwig II. zu sichern.', 'Die \\"Gesellschaft mit dem Greifen\\" wurde wegen ihrer Aufnahme in spätere Turnier- und Wappenbücher –- bei Rüxner sogar fälschend zurückverlegt bis zu einem sagenhaften Magdeburger Turnier von 938 – als Turniergesellschaft bezeichnet. Es handelte sich aber um ein Bündnis des Grafen Johann von Wertheim, des Grafen Gotfrid von Rieneck und anderer Adeliger, um sich im Angriffsfalle gegenseitig beizustehen. Sie fürchteten, in den Konflikt zwischen dem Erzbischof von Mainz und dem Pfalzgrafen Ruprecht dem Älteren hineingezogen zu werden. Wertheim und Rieneck waren dem Erzbischof in einem Solddienstvertrag verpflichtet.', 'Eine Verlagerung der Schwerpunkte ist auch bei den beiden Gesellschaften \\"Falke\\" in Oberschwaben und \\"Fisch\\" am Bodensee zu beobachten. Beide Gesellschaften hatten von Anfang an an Turnieren teilgenommen, aber besonders bei den Falken stand das innere und äußere Friedensgebot, mit Schiedsgericht und gegenseitigem Schutz bei äußerem Angriff, klar im Vordergrund. Im Jahr 1479 kam es zu einem Bündnisvertrag zwischen den beiden selbständig bleibenden Gesellschaften, der nur von den beiden Königen gesiegelt wurde. Der Aspekt des gegenseitigen Schutzes spielte bei diesem Bündnis eine herausragende Rolle. 1484 vereinigten sich dann die beiden Gesellschaften zur Gesellschaft vom \\"Fisch und Falken\\". Dies ging einher mit der Zeit der großen Turniere in den 80er Jahren des 15. Jahrhunderts. Die Aufnahmeregeln für die neue Gesellschaft nahmen ausdrücklich auf die „Vier-Lande-Turniere“ Bezug: Aufgenommen werden sollte nur derjenige, „…so fern derselbe von den Vier Landen deß Turners zugelassen wuerdt“. Interessant ist, dass die Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit der Gesellschaft auf die Kampf- und Schiedsgerichte der Turniere übertragen wurde, das heißt, Auseinandersetzungen konnten auch im Turnierkampf und vor dem dortigen Schiedsgericht ausgetragen werden und das Ergebnis war zu akzeptieren. Ein weiterer Aspekt, der die stärkere Hinwendung dieser neuen fusionierten Gesellschaft zum Turnier erklärt, ist das gleichzeitige Erstarken der \\"Gesellschaft mit Sankt Jörgenschild\\". Fast sämtliche Mitglieder der neuen Gesellschaft waren gleichzeitig auch in der vornehmlich politische Interessen verfolgenden Gesellschaft vom \\"Fisch und Falken\\" vertreten. Auch andere Gesellschaften, welche sich ausschließlich als „Thornergesellschaften“ verstanden, wie der \\"Leitbracken\\", oder die \\"Gekrönten Steinböcke\\", hatten in ihren Statuten Regelungen zur internen Friedenswahrung, also ein genossenschaftliches Regulativ des Fehdewesens.', 'Abgrenzung vom Begriff „Ritterbund“.', 'Auch der Begriff „Ritter“ in neuzeitlichen Bezeichnungen wie „Ritterbund“ oder der noch weitergehenden Begriffsvermischung „Ritterorden“ muss relativiert werden.

Der Erstflug dieses Langstreckenflugzeugs fand am 25. Oktober 1991 in der Version A340-300 statt. Der Tiefdecker war das erste Verkehrsflugzeug von Airbus mit vier Triebwerken und das erste zivile Großraumflugzeug weltweit mit digitaler Fly-by-wire-Steuerung. Der Airbus A340 wurde parallel zum Airbus A330 entwickelt, mit dem er viele Merkmale und Baugruppen gemeinsam hat. Die Endmontage der A340 fand in Toulouse auf einer gemeinsamen Taktstraße zusammen mit der A330 statt. Bis Mai 2013 wurden alle 377 bestellten Flugzeuge dieses Typs ausgeliefert, von denen Ende März 2018 noch 275 im Dienst waren.', 'Am 10.

Ebenfalls wurden damals die Konzepte der späteren A320 unter dem Namen \\"SA9\\" und der späteren A330 unter dem Namen \\"TA9\\" vorgestellt, wobei auch die grundsätzlichen Leistungsdaten genannt wurden. Trotz der nachdrücklichen Forderung der Lufthansa, die Entwicklung der TA11 zu forcieren, zog Airbus jedoch das A320-Programm vor und stellte damit die Entwicklung der TA9/TA11 zurück.', 'Entwicklung.', 'Das neue Flugzeugprogramm wurde inoffiziell am 24. Januar 1986 in München und offiziell am 5. Juni 1987 mit dem Ziel gestartet, das Airbus-Programm, das bisher lediglich aus Flugzeugtypen für Kurzstrecken (A320), Mittelstrecken (A300) und Langstrecken für kleine Passagieraufkommen (A310) bestand, mit einem (Ultra-)Langstreckenflugzeug mittlerer Passagierkapazität nach oben hin abzurunden. Zu dieser Zeit gab es genau für dieses Segment des Linienverkehrs eigentlich nur die amerikanischen, veralteten Flugzeugtypen McDonnell Douglas DC-10 und Lockheed L-1011, einige kostenintensivere östliche Verkehrsflugzeuge, ebenso die für Langstrecken geeignete Boeing 767, deren Nachteil die Ausstattung mit nur zwei Triebwerken war. Für die Boeing 767 musste immer eine Flugroute in größerer Nähe zu Flugplätzen gewählt werden, um im Falle eines Triebwerkausfalls notlanden zu können. Da diese Auflage unter anderem auf der Atlantikstrecke zu deutlich längeren Flugstrecken führt, wurde die A340 mit vier Triebwerken geplant. Damit umging man, wie bei der ebenfalls vierstrahligen Boeing 747, diese ETOPS-Einschränkungen. Das gab den Fluggesellschaften neben der Treibstoffersparnis ein Argument zur Beruhigung ggf. besorgter Passagiere. Noch in den späten 1990er-Jahren wurde mit diesen Argumenten geworben, als die mit zwei Triebwerken auf den Markt kommende Boeing 777 der A340 Konkurrenz machte. Virgin Atlantic Airways beispielsweise warb für seine damals ausschließlich aus vierstrahligen Flugzeugen bestehende Flotte mit dem Wahlspruch „4 Engines 4 Long Haul“ (in etwa: „Vier Triebwerke für die Langstrecke“).', 'Probleme beim SuperFan.', 'Die Entwicklung des Airbus A340 lief bis auf Schwierigkeiten bei den Triebwerken vergleichsweise problemlos ab: Ursprünglich wollten sowohl CFM International als auch International Aero Engines Triebwerke für die neue A340 anbieten und liefern. Jedoch war nur das \\"CFM International CFM56\\" in den späten 1980er-Jahren stark genug, um den grundsätzlichen Anforderungen von Airbus gerecht zu werden; das von IAE angebotene Triebwerk \\"V2500\\" erwies sich auch in der damals höchsten Entwicklungsstufe als zu leistungsschwach. Jedoch bot IAE eine revolutionäre Weiterentwicklung an: Aus dem Kerntriebwerk des V2500 wollte man einen Getriebefan namens \\"SuperFan\\" entwickeln. Das Konzept beinhaltete einen großen Bläser, der über ein Untersetzungsgetriebe angetrieben werden sollte. Um eine hohe Leistung zu erreichen, sollte er über verstellbare Schaufeln verfügen. Um wettbewerbsfähig zu bleiben, entwickelte CFM zeitgleich eine neue Version ihres CFM56, welche die geforderten Leistungsparameter leicht übertraf und man schaffte es, weiterhin eine Alternative zu bleiben. Airbus und seine Kunden bevorzugten jedoch IAEs SuperFan, da dieses Triebwerk eine weitaus höhere Wirtschaftlichkeit versprach. Experten bezweifelten jedoch von Anfang an die Versprechungen IAEs, in der Kürze der Zeit ein derart komplexes Triebwerk, für das viele neue Technologien benötigt wurden, zu entwickeln. Es kam schließlich zum Debakel: Am 7. April 1987 gab das Unternehmen bekannt, die Entwicklung am SuperFan vollkommen einzustellen. Dies war kurz- wie auch langfristig ein harter Schlag für das A340-Programm. Das CFM56 als nun einziges verfügbares Triebwerk erreichte bei weitem nicht die Leistungen des SuperFans. Airbus musste somit einige Änderungen am Flugzeug durchführen. Die Spannweite wurde um zwei Meter erhöht und die eigentlich vorgesehen Wingtip Fences, die auch an der A310 und A380 installiert sind, wurden durch 2,74 Meter hohe, auftriebserzeugende Winglets ersetzt. Diese Winglets bekam auch der Airbus A330, weil bei ihm die gleichen Tragflächen wie bei der A340 verwendet werden. Darüber hinaus wurden einige geplante Systemeinbauten aus Gewichtsgründen gestrichen, wodurch die ursprünglichen Leistungsgarantien der A340 wieder erreicht werden konnten. Jedoch sind die CFM56-Versionen der A340 an der Grenze der Leistungssteigerbarkeit der CFM56-Triebwerksfamilie angelangt. Daher wurden die späteren Versionen A340-500/-600 mit Rolls-Royce Trent 500 ausgestattet.', 'Verkaufsprobleme mit steigendem Ölpreis.', 'Als in den 1990er-Jahren und insbesondere ab 2001 der Ölpreis immer mehr zu steigen begann und gleichzeitig die ETOPS-Regelungen für die im gleichen Marktsegment operierenden, zweistrahligen Boeing 777 immer großzügiger wurden, trat der größte Vorteil des Vierstrahlers, an keine Beschränkungen gebunden zu sein, immer mehr in den Hintergrund und die Nachteile des Konzepts wurden immer deutlicher: Vier Triebwerke benötigen mehr Kontrollsysteme, verursachen mehr Gewicht, höhere Wartungskosten, und verbrauchen mehr Kerosin. Hier zeigte sich nun der Vorteil der zweistrahligen A330, die sich weiterhin sehr gut verkaufte und somit Hartmut Mehdorns (damals Vorstandsmitglied der Deutschen Aerospace AG) Voraussage bestätigte, in der er – der Meinung der meisten Fachleute widersprechend – voraussagte, die ursprünglich eigentlich für Charterfluggesellschaften konzipierte A330 werde sich langfristig dreimal so gut verkaufen wie die A340. Dennoch können ohne ETOPS weiterhin speziell im Pazifik-Raum bis heute direktere Routen geflogen werden. Ungeachtet dessen gewann Boeing immer mehr Aufträge für die Boeing 777, während Airbus die A340 seltener verkaufen konnte: Im Jahr 2005 verkaufte das Unternehmen beispielsweise nur 15 Flugzeuge, während Boeing im selben Zeitraum 154 Bestellungen für die Boeing 777 erhielt. Airbus reagierte schließlich darauf sowie auf die neue Boeing 787 mit der Entwicklung des zweistrahligen Langstreckenflugzeugs A350 XWB.', 'Einstellung des Programms.', 'In einer EADS-Pressemitteilung am 10. November 2011 wurden einmalige positive Auswirkungen auf das EBIT der ersten neun Monate 2011 in Höhe von 192 Mio. € angegeben, die mit der Einstellung des A340-Programms begründet wurden.

Die beiden letzten A340 des Untertyps A340-500, die von Kingfisher Airlines bestellt, aber nicht abgenommen wurden, verkaufte Airbus am 15. November 2012 an die Leasingfirma AJW Capital. AJW Capital hat die beiden A340-500 an Azerbaijan Airlines weiterveräußert.', 'Airbus bekam insgesamt 377 Aufträge (375 Auslieferungen).

November 2011 129 Exemplare an die Kunden übergeben wurden.', 'Kommunalität.', 'In vielen Bereichen dieses Flugzeugs findet man die Anwendung der sogenannten Kommunalität wieder. Das bedeutet, dass Systeme verschiedener Flugzeugtypen identisch sind, um dadurch Kosten einzusparen. So ist etwa die A340 eng mit dem Airbus A330 verwandt. Gegenüber der zweistrahligen A330 sind die Tragflächen im Bereich der äußeren Triebwerke verstärkt. Viele weitere Baugruppen sind mit denen der A330 identisch. Die Avionik ist im Wesentlichen die gleiche wie bei der A330 und der A320-Familie. Die CFM-International-CFM56-Triebwerke der beiden ersten Versionen A340-200 und -300 werden auch bei der Boeing 737 und der Airbus-A320-Familie eingesetzt. Außerdem ist das Cockpit mit dem der A320-Familie und der A330 gleich und weist mit dem von A350 und A380 große Ähnlichkeiten auf. Dadurch werden der Umschulungsaufwand der Piloten und die Einarbeitungszeit für Wartungstechniker verringert, was Kosten reduziert.

Hält sie hingegen unmittelbar vor dem Verzehr das Urteil ‚Es ist besser, die Sahnetorte zu essen‘ für richtig, nachdem sie zuvor gegenteiliger Auffassung war, liegt kein Fall von Akrasia vor.', 'Die Erklärung derartiger Handlungen ist ein Problem der Handlungstheorie.

Fälle hingegen, in denen wir nicht anders hätten handeln können, sondern die für schlechter gehaltene Handlung ausführen müssen, sind keine eigentlichen Fälle von Akrasia, sondern von Unfreiheit, Abhängigkeit oder Sucht.', 'Da akratische Handlungen diesem Prinzip zu widersprechen scheinen, ist von Philosophen immer wieder bestritten worden, dass Akrasia möglich ist.

Aufgrund dessen ist diese Frage nur mittels eigener Erfahrung, Gedankenexperimenten und Begriffsanalyse zu lösen. Gleichwohl gibt es auch außerhalb der Philosophie ein Interesse am Problem der Akrasia. So beschäftigen sich etwa Soziologen wie Jon Elster im Rahmen der Theorie der rationalen Entscheidung mit Irrationalität und dem Problem der Akrasia.

Es sei aber absurd anzunehmen, dass die Personen in diesen Fällen „von der Lust überwunden“ worden seien.', 'Diese Fälle, so Sokrates im \\"Protagoras\\", seien vielmehr damit zu erklären, dass die entsprechenden Personen nicht das richtige Wissen über den Lustwert der beiden jeweiligen Handlungen hätten; vermutlich hätten sich diese über den genauen Wert verschätzt – möglicherweise weil A zeitlich näher und B ferner war. Sokrates argumentiert im Protagoras also dafür, dass nur eines von beidem möglich ist: Wenn eine Person eine abträgliche Handlung ausgeführt hat, dann hatte sie das entsprechende Wissen nicht; wenn sie das entsprechende Wissen hat, dann führt sie die abträgliche Handlung nicht aus. Diese im Bereich der Lust gewonnene Erkenntnis verallgemeinert Sokrates:', 'Da Wissen für Sokrates, und den frühen Platon, mit Tugend \\"(Arete)\\" identisch ist, ist es notwendige und hinreichende Bedingung dafür, das Glück zu erlangen. Ein Akratiker handelt gemäß dieser Position gegen sein ureigenstes Interesse.', 'Aristoteles.', 'Aristoteles beschäftigt sich mit Akrasia in \\"Nikomachische Ethik\\" VII 1–11. Dort findet sich die historisch wirkungsmächtigste und vielleicht die bis ins 20. Jahrhundert systematisch wichtigste Auseinandersetzung mit Akrasia. Aristoteles beschreibt Akrasia als eine Charakterdisposition neben anderen, die zu meiden ist. Er knüpft an die von Sokrates formulierte These an, dass derartiges Handeln und Wissen nicht gleichzeitig vorkommen können.', 'Akrasia tritt nach Aristoteles hauptsächlich bei Handlungen auf, die mit körperlicher Lust (Essen, Trinken und Sexualität) verbunden sind; ein weiterer Typ tritt bei Zorn auf.

Demnach gibt es für Aristoteles vier Typen von Akrasia:', 'Zwei Erklärungstypen und der praktische Syllogismus', 'Aristoteles argumentiert gegen die These des sokratischen Intellektualismus, dass Handeln wider besseres Wissen nicht möglich sei. Denn dies widerspreche den Phänomenen oder den gängigen Auffassungen über das Handeln.

Alle anderen Konformationen liegen bezüglich ihrer Energie zwischen diesen beiden Extremen. Die Ursache für die Differenz ist noch nicht vollständig aufgeklärt: Bei der ekliptischen Konformation ist der Abstand zwischen den C-H-Bindungselektronen des vorderen und hinteren Kohlenstoffatoms geringer, die elektrostatische Abstoßung zwischen ihnen und damit die Energie des Zustandes folglich höher. Umgekehrt erlaubt die gestaffelte Konformation eine stärkere Delokalisation der Bindungselektronen, ein quantenmechanisches Phänomen, das die Struktur stabilisiert und die Energie herabsetzt. Heute gilt der Letztere Erklärungsansatz als wahrscheinlicher.', 'Die Torsionsenergie des Ethanmoleküls ist bei Raumtemperatur klein gegenüber der thermischen Energie, so dass es sich dann in konstanter Rotation um die C-C-Achse befindet.

Die meisten Mikroorganismen (Mikroben) mit der Fähigkeit zur alkoholischen Gärung nutzen diesen Stoffwechselweg nur vorübergehend zur Energiegewinnung, wenn der zur Atmung benötigte Sauerstoff fehlt.', 'Die Nutzung der alkoholischen Gärung durch den Menschen zur Herstellung alkoholischer Getränke gab es schon in prähistorischer Zeit. In der heutigen Zeit dient die alkoholische Gärung außerdem der Umwandlung von Biomasse in Ethanol als sekundärer Energieträger.', 'Forschungsgeschichte.', 'Schon in vorgeschichtlicher Zeit erzeugten Jäger und Sammler alkoholische Getränke. 1815 stellte der französische Chemiker Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac erstmals die Brutto-Reaktionsgleichung für den Abbau von Glucose zu Ethanol auf. Danach entwickelten sich verschiedene Ansichten über den Ablauf der Gärung. Während in den 1830er Jahren Jöns Jakob Berzelius und Justus von Liebig mit der „mechanistischen Gärungstheorie“ bestimmten Stoffen eine katalysierende Wirkung zuschrieben, meinten Charles Cagniard-Latour, Theodor Schwann und Friedrich Traugott Kützing unabhängig voneinander, dass Lebewesen, nämlich Hefen, dafür verantwortlich seien. Louis Pasteur postulierte 1857 die „vitalistische Gärungstheorie“, der zufolge die alkoholische Gärung nur in Verbindung mit lebenden Zellen möglich sei.', 'Diese Kontroverse wurde am 11. Januar 1897 von dem Chemiker Eduard Buchner entschieden mit einer Publikation über den Nachweis der alkoholischen Gärung mittels zellfreien Hefeextrakts. Er machte den Stoff Zymase – nach aktuellem Wissen ein Gemisch verschiedener Enzyme – für die Umsetzung von Zucker zu Ethanol verantwortlich und erhielt 1907 den Nobelpreis für Chemie „für seine biochemischen Untersuchungen und die Entdeckung der zellfreien Gärung“. Nähere Untersuchungen durch Arthur Harden und William John Young führten zur Entdeckung eines phosphorylierten Zwischenprodukts: des Harden-Young-Esters, bekannt als Fructose-1,6-bisphosphat. Zusammen erhielten Harden und Hans von Euler-Chelpin 1929 für ihre „Forschung über die Zuckervergärung und deren Anteil der Enzyme an diesem Vorgang“ ebenfalls den Nobelpreis für Chemie. Nachdem Stück für Stück die Teilreaktionen aufgeklärt und Schemata für den Ablauf der Gärung entworfen wurden, identifizierte Otto Warburg den Cofaktor Nicotinamidadenindinukleotid (NADH) als essentiellen Bestandteil des Gärprozesses. Schon 1937 gelang Erwin Negelein und Hans Joachim Wulff die Kristallisation des Gärungsenzyms Alkoholdehydrogenase.', 'Weitere Forscher, die nach Buchner an der Aufdeckung der Enzymkette der alkoholischen Gärung mitwirkten, waren Carl Neuberg, Gustav Embden, Otto Fritz Meyerhof, Jakub Karol Parnas, Karl Lohmann sowie Gerty Cori und Carl Ferdinand Cori.', 'Die an der Gärung beteiligten Enzyme aus verschiedenen Spezies sind mittlerweile isoliert und biochemisch charakterisiert (pH-Optimum, Temperaturoptimum, Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit, Umsatzrate). Die Kristallstrukturanalyse gewährte einen ersten Einblick in ihre molekulare Raumstruktur. Es bestehen Erkenntnisse über die Reaktionsmechanismen. Alles in allem können Vergleiche zwischen den Spezies gezogen werden. Die entschlüsselten Gene, die die Baupläne für diese Enzyme enthalten, geben Aufschluss über die evolutionäre Herkunft und über ihre eventuelle ursprüngliche Funktion.', 'Die Rolle im Stoffwechsel.', 'Die alkoholische Gärung wird vor allem von Zuckerhefen betrieben, unter Sauerstoffmangel dient sie ihnen zur Energiegewinnung. Steht Sauerstoff zur Verfügung, bauen sie Zucker durch Zellatmung ab und gewinnen so die zum Leben benötigte Energie. Der Zucker wird dabei durch eine lange Reihe chemischer, enzymatischer (d. h. durch Enzyme katalysierter) Umsetzungen (Glykolyse – Citratzyklus – Atmungskette) unter Sauerstoffverbrauch vollständig zu Kohlendioxid und Wasser oxidiert. Steht kein Sauerstoff zur Verfügung, so haben die Hefen in der alkoholischen Gärung eine alternative Möglichkeit zur Energiegewinnung. Sie können aber damit – im Vergleich zur vollständigen Oxidation durch Zellatmung – wesentlich weniger Energie in Form von Adenosintriphosphat (ATP) aus Glucose gewinnen: Beim Abbau von einem Molekül Glucose können bei dessen vollständiger Oxidation 32 Moleküle ATP gewonnen werden, bei der alkoholischen Gärung dagegen nur zwei Moleküle ATP. Diese zwei ATP werden in der Glykolyse gewonnen, dem ersten Schritt in der Reaktionsfolge sowohl der Zellatmung als auch der Gärung. Die zwei weiteren Reaktionsschritte der Gärung und damit letztlich die Ethanolproduktion dienen nicht der Energiegewinnung, sondern der Regeneration des Cofaktors NAD+, der bei den enzymatischen Umsetzungen der Glykolyse verbraucht wird. Da NAD nur in begrenzten Mengen vorhanden ist, wird es durch die Gärungsenzyme aus dem reduzierten Zustand (NADH) durch Oxidation mit Acetaldehyd wieder in den oxidierten Zustand (NAD+) versetzt; der Acetaldehyd wird dabei zu Ethanol reduziert.', 'Hefen sind fakultative Anaerobier. Wenn Sauerstoff zur Verfügung steht, wird Glucose aerob verstoffwechselt, nämlich vollständig zu Kohlenstoffdioxid und Wasser oxidiert. Unter Luftabschluss müssen Hefen dagegen die alkoholische Gärung betreiben. Da bei dieser weit weniger Energie je Molekül umgesetzter Glucose erzeugt wird als bei der aeroben Atmung, steigt die Geschwindigkeit des Glucose-Umsatzes stark an, wodurch der geringere ATP-Gewinn je Molekül umgesetzter Glucose teilweise kompensiert wird. Dieses Phänomen wird Pasteur-Effekt genannt. Wegen der eingeschränkten Energiegewinnung wachsen und vermehren sich Hefen unter Luftabschluss weit weniger stark als bei Luftzutritt. Außerdem wirkt das entstehende Ethanol als Zellgift.', 'Wenn Hefen in einem Medium mit hoher Zuckerkonzentration wachsen und ihre Enzyme der Zellatmung dadurch überlastet sind, betreiben sie alkoholische Gärung, obwohl genügend Sauerstoff vorhanden ist. Die Hefen nehmen ständig den Zucker auf und verwerten ihn neben der Zellatmung zusätzlich durch Gärung. Es handelt sich hierbei um den Crabtree-Effekt.', 'Neben Hefearten betreiben auch manche Bakterien alkoholische Gärung. So nutzt \\"Sarcina ventriculi\\" den gleichen enzymatischen Weg wie Hefe, während \\"Zymomonas mobilis\\" einen alternativen Weg beschreitet. Ebenso konnte in verschiedenen Pflanzen geringe Ethanolbildung bei Sauerstoffmangel nachgewiesen werden.', 'Biochemische Grundlagen.', 'Enzymatische Reaktionen.', 'Die ersten Schritte der alkoholischen Gärung sind die der Glykolyse. Bei Backhefe (\\"S. cerevisiae\\") ist dies der Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas-Weg, während das Bakterium \\"Zymomonas mobilis\\" den Entner-Doudoroff-Weg verwendet. Hierbei wird ein Molekül -Glucose zu zwei Molekülen Pyruvat umgesetzt. Bei \\"S. cerevisiae\\" entstehen hierbei zwei Moleküle Adenosintriphosphat (ATP) aus zwei Molekülen Adenosindiphosphat (ADP) und zwei Phosphatresten (Pi) durch Substratkettenphosphorylierung. Bei \\"Z. mobilis\\" wird nur ein Molekül ATP gebildet. Zusätzlich werden bei beiden Wegen zwei Moleküle NAD+ (Nicotinamidadenindinukleotid) zu zwei Molekülen NADH reduziert.', 'Damit die Glykolyse erneut ablaufen kann, muss NAD+ regeneriert werden. Dies geschieht unter anaeroben Bedingungen in der folgenden Gärungsreaktion. Von jedem Molekül Pyruvat wird ein Molekül Kohlenstoffdioxid durch das Enzym Pyruvatdecarboxylase () abgespalten. Als Cofaktoren dienen bei dieser Reaktion Thiaminpyrophosphat, ein Verwandter des Vitamin B1, und zwei Magnesiumionen. Die Pyruvatdecarboxylase darf nicht mit der Pyruvatdehydrogenase E1 () des Pyruvatdehydrogenase-Komplexes verwechselt werden, das beim \\"aeroben\\" Abbau von Pyruvat eine zentrale Rolle spielt.', 'Das in diesem Schritt entstehende Acetaldehyd ist für den Organismus sehr giftig und wird im folgenden Schritt sofort weiter umgesetzt. Das katalysierende Enzym Alkoholdehydrogenase () enthält ein Zinkion (Zn2+), welches die Carbonylgruppe am Acetaldehyd polarisiert. Dadurch können zwei Elektronen und ein Proton vom NADH auf das Acetaldehyd übertragen werden, wodurch es zu Ethanol reduziert und NAD+ regeneriert wird. Sowohl die Glykolyse als auch die zwei Folgereaktionen finden im Zytoplasma der Zelle statt.', 'Die Netto-Reaktionsgleichung für Bäckerhefe lautet:', 'Das Enzym Alkoholdehydrogenase stellt Ethanol durch Reduktion von Acetaldehyd her, katalysiert aber auch die Rückreaktion. Während der alkoholischen Gärung läuft zum größten Teil die Reduktion von Acetaldehyd zu Ethanol ab. Das entstandene Ethanol wird anschließend von den Zellen an die Umgebung abgegeben.', 'Die Oxidation von Ethanol zu Acetaldehyd dagegen findet beispielsweise bei der Entgiftung von Ethanol in der Leber statt. Acetaldehyd ist giftig und neben Fuselölen die Hauptursache für Kopfschmerz und Übelkeit nach heftigem Alkoholgenuss (der sogenannte „Kater“). Acetaldehyd wird vom Enzym Acetaldehyddehydrogenase zu Essigsäure oxidiert.', 'Nebenprodukte.', 'Bei der alkoholischen Gärung durch Hefen entstehen als unerwünschte Nebenprodukte Methanol und Begleitalkohole wie Butanol, Amylalkohol und Hexanol. Ihre Bildung verläuft nicht auf dem hier beschriebenen Stoffwechselweg, sondern zum Beispiel über den Abbau von Aminosäuren, Methanol aus der Spaltung von Pektinen. Im Körper wird Methanol vom Enzym Alkoholdehydrogenase zum giftigen Formaldehyd oxidiert. Trinkt man Alkohol mit hohem Methanolgehalt, so entsteht im Körper entsprechend viel Formaldehyd, welches schnell über Aldehyddehydrogenase in Ameisensäure überführt wird. Diese wird in der Folge zu Kohlenstoffdioxid und Wasser verstoffwechselt. Da der Abbau der Ameisensäure langsamer erfolgt als die Bildung, kommt es im Körper zu einer Akkumulation von Ameisensäure und in deren Folge zu einer metabolischen Azidose, die neben der Schädigung des Sehnervs schließlich zum Tod führen kann.

You are a senior financial adviser employed for the past three years by FutureLife, with an offer for equity in the business within the next few years. With the business having experienced exceptional growth over the past 12 months, FutureLife has decided they need an additional adviser. Rather than hire outside the firm, they have opted to transition their young support staff member, Josie, into an adviser role. Shaun’s clients are predominantly self-funded retirees, with a small number who require specialised aged care financial advice. His clients have accumulated their wealth through successful small businesses. Shaun prefers to look after his existing clients, with any new clients referred to yourself or Emily. Emily’s clients (age 35 to 55) are successful wealthy professionals from a mix of professional backgrounds. Given their wealth, Emily has recommended self-managed superannuation funds to a number of these clients. Josie has worked in the practice in a number of support roles over the last four years while she was completing her university degree. Josie graduated 12 months ago with an approved Bachelor of Commerce (Financial Planning) degree. As part of her career planning, you have agreed to supervise Josie through her professional year, and she is currently in the third quarter of her professional year. You have 10 years experience as a financial adviser and are fully qualified to provide advice on a wide range of strategies and products. Half of your clients followed you to FutureLife, from your previous financial adviser role. When Shaun or Emily is on leave, you also help out by providing advice to their clients. Scenario 1 — FutureLife clients: Les and Marg Russell Les and Marg Russell are both in the late 60s and have been clients of the practice for many years, mainly dealing with Shaun. They have one child, a son Robert, with whom they have a strained relationship, and they are not on speaking terms. They do however see their only grandchild, Jennifer (age 22), who is Robert’s daughter, on a regular basis. As Jennifer is just about to complete her university degree, Les and Marg think it would be a good time to give Jennifer 200,000, as they have significant wealth accumulated and would prefer to see Jennifer benefit from the funds while they are alive. Les and Marg have already spoken to Shaun about how they believe the money should be managed and invested. Before telling Jennifer about the gift, Les and Marg asked her what her financial goals are. Jennifer said she wasn’t sure but would like to travel overseas or save towards a deposit for her own home. Les and Marg insist that Jennifer receives financial advice before they gift her the money, to ensure she has an effective financial plan in place. They think it would be better for Jennifer to deal with an adviser closer to her own age and suggest that Josie would be suitable. Les and Marg have always found Josie to be friendly over the years and are comfortable that you and Shaun will be mentoring Josie. This will be Josie’s first meeting (indirectly supervised) as a provisional relevant provider. You ask Josie about her current plan for the interview, and she provides you with the following outline: Jennifer’s grandparents have already spoken to Shaun about how Jennifer’s gift should be managed and invested. Les and Marg have been Shaun’s clients for a long time and have done well financially, and I’m assuming they know what they are talking about and will be able to provide Jennifer with the right guidance on investments too. To save a bit of time, I’ve already emailed the FSG to Jennifer and I’ll get her to acknowledge she has received it, when I see her. The money will be given to Jennifer as cash. Given that Jennifer is in her early 20s, she has a long-term investment horizon, and it sounds like high-growth investments will be an appropriate solution for her. We’ve got some really great model portfolios of direct shares on our approved product list, which are currently generating high returns for other clients, that I can talk to her about. I am a bit concerned her grandparents may not be happy for her to put all the funds just in shares, so I may need to check with them about that. This meeting should be straightforward as we will focus just on investing the 200,000 gift and I doubt whether Jennifer will need any insurance, given her young age. She will eventually inherit all of her grandparents’ money anyway, and I’m sure they would look after her if anything was to happen to her in the meantime. IN 1200 WORDS answer the following ---- (a) Define ‘unconscious bias’ and examine how it may be influencing Josie while she is planning for the meeting with Jennifer. (10 marks) (b) Discuss the intent of Standard 1 and Standard 2 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 and analyse Josie’s conduct. Include in your response a discussion of whether, prior to the meeting, Josie complies with the standards in her dealings with Jennifer. Note to students: this question is asking you to analyse the advisers actions against compliance with Standard 1 and Standard 2 — leading up to the appointment, rather than after the meeting has occurred. (10 marks) (c) Examine and discuss Josie’s compliance with the value of Fairness in the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019, if she proceeds with the interview as planned. (5 marks)","completion":"(a) Unconscious bias refers to the automatic, unconscious judgments and preferences that individuals make based on social stereotypes, personal experiences, and cultural background. These biases can unknowingly influence decision-making and interactions with others, leading to potentially unfair treatment and discrimination. In Josie's planning for the meeting with Jennifer, several instances of unconscious bias may be evident. Firstly, Josie assumes that because Les and Marg have been successful clients and have significant wealth, they will be able to provide the right guidance to Jennifer on investments. This assumption may be biased and prevent Josie from properly assessing Jennifer’s financial needs and objectives independently. Secondly, Josie believes that high growth investments would be appropriate for Jennifer because she is in her early 20s and has a long-term investment horizon. This assumption is based on the stereotype that young people are more risk-tolerant and more likely to invest in high-growth investments. While this may be true for some individuals, it may not be the case for Jennifer, and it is essential to assess her risk tolerance and financial goals, not merely her age. Lastly, Josie may be biased in assuming that Jennifer does not need any insurance due to her age. Josie thinks that Jennifer's grandparents will look after her if anything were to happen, and she will eventually inherit their wealth. This assumption disregards Jennifer's potential needs and personal circumstances, which could lead to inadequate protection and financial planning. (b) Standard 1 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 states that financial advisers must act in their clients' best interests, prioritise their clients' interests over their own, and provide advice that is appropriate to their clients' circumstances. Before the meeting, Josie's conduct may not fully comply with Standard 1, as she is making assumptions about Jennifer's financial goals, risk tolerance, and insurance needs based on her age and grandparents' financial situation. By relying on these assumptions and not properly assessing Jennifer's individual needs and circumstances, Josie may not be providing advice that truly serves Jennifer's best interests. Standard 2 of the Code of Ethics states that financial advisers must act with integrity and honesty, avoiding any misleading or deceptive conduct. Prior to the meeting, Josie's conduct may also not fully comply with Standard 2. By emailing the FSG to Jennifer and planning to obtain acknowledgement of receipt at the meeting, Josie may not be providing enough time and opportunity for Jennifer to review and understand the information contained in the FSG. To ensure compliance with Standard 2, Josie should ensure that Jennifer has ample time to review the FSG and encourage her to ask questions if she has any concerns or queries. (c) The value of Fairness in the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 relates to treating clients with dignity, respect, and fairness, regardless of their personal characteristics or circumstances. If Josie proceeds with the interview as planned, her compliance with the value of Fairness may be compromised. By basing her advice on Les and Marg's opinions and not conducting her own independent assessment of Jennifer's financial needs and objectives, Josie may not be treating Jennifer fairly. This could lead to Jennifer receiving advice that does not align with her personal goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, assuming that Jennifer does not need insurance and will be taken care of by her grandparents may not be a fair consideration of her personal circumstances. It is essential for Josie to evaluate Jennifer's unique situation and provide recommendations that address her needs accurately. In conclusion, Josie's unconscious biases and assumptions may negatively impact her compliance with the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. To ensure adherence to the Code's standards and values, it is crucial for Josie to recognise these biases, conduct a thorough assessment of Jennifer's financial needs and circumstances, and provide advice that prioritises her best interests."},{"prompt":"Scenario 2 — FutureLife clients: Matthew and Claudia Edwards One of your longstanding clients, Matthew Edwards, has called to arrange an appointment for you to see his mother Claudia (age 78). Matthew’s father passed away a little over six months ago and his estate has now been finalised with all assets transferring into Claudia’s name. Matthew’s father John always looked after their own finances and invested primarily through direct shares. Mathew has emailed you a portfolio listing all the shareholdings now in Claudia’s name, as well as details of all the cash holdings. The cash and shares add up to just over 2 million, based on the current share prices. Mathew was going to attend the meeting with his mother but has been caught up at work and is now unable to make it. He calls you and says to meet with his mother anyway, as it is her money, and she is quite capable of making her own decisions. You commence your meeting with Claudia by providing her your FSG and passing on information about your practice and the advice you can give. Claudia just nods while you speak, and you ask her if she understands what you have outlined. Claudia replies, ‘some of it — but it doesn’t really matter, as you always look after Matthew, and he says you will look after me’. While you are not entirely convinced that Claudia understands everything you have said, you are confident that she has the legal capacity to make her own decisions, so you decide to continue with your initial meeting. You begin the fact-finding process and ask Claudia a range of questions to understand her current situation, goals and objectives. She says that Matthew should have provided the details of the investments, and aside from that, she just wants ‘things to continue as they were before John passed away’. John always told Claudia they had enough money to see them through their life and had things set up to provide a regular amount into the bank account for them to spend, and Claudia is happy for this arrangement to continue. She admits that she has never been part of the decision making financially, mainly because she was not interested and just let her husband deal with things. Now she is on her own, she just wants things to continue and says that as long as Matthew agrees with what you recommend, she will be happy with that, and she will sign whatever needs to be signed. --- in 1300 words answer the following --- (a) Discuss some risks that may arise from Claudia’s apparent minimal knowledge of (or experience with) investing and overall disinterest in the financial planning process. In your response, identify and discuss at least one ethical barrier that is possibly impacting Claudia and at least one ethical barrier that is possibly impacting yourself (the adviser) (10 marks) (b) Identify at least three (3) relevant standards under the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 that have arisen for consideration based on the approach or actions that Claudia has displayed, and explain your concerns, with reference to the standards. (10 marks) (c) Based on your meeting with Claudia, identify and describe two (2) different appropriate ethical frameworks that could be used to deal with this client interaction/situation. Note to students: the ethical frameworks to choose from are the Consequentialist, Duty or Virtue frameworks. (10 marks) Support your answers with reference to the case study and scenario facts and research.","completion":"(a) Risks associated with Claudia's minimal knowledge and disinterest in the financial planning process include: 1. Inappropriate investment decisions: Claudia's limited investment knowledge and experience might cause her to make investment decisions based on incorrect or incomplete information, resulting in suboptimal investment outcomes. Her reliance on her son Matthew and the adviser may not lead her to the best decisions for her own circumstances. 2. Exploitation or manipulation: Claudia's disinterest in financial matters makes her vulnerable to potential misconduct or exploitation by unscrupulous parties. 3. Lack of personal involvement: Claudia's disinterest in her finances may hinder her understanding of the implications and risks associated with the decisions she is making. This could result in unexpected negative outcomes due to a lack of oversight or regular review of her financial situation. One ethical barrier possibly impacting Claudia is self-determination. Claudia's limited financial knowledge and lack of interest in financial matters may make it challenging for her to make informed decisions about her financial future. By relying on the advice and guidance of her son Matthew and the financial adviser, she may be unintentionally relinquishing control over her financial situation and not fostering the autonomy that she should be exercising. Conversely, one ethical barrier affecting the adviser is the potential conflict between what is in Claudia's best interest and maintaining the trusting relationship with her son, Matthew. The adviser may feel inclined to prioritize Matthew's perspective and opinions to preserve the existing relationship, instead of ensuring Claudia's best interests are genuinely being served. (b) Three relevant standards from the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 associated with Claudia's approach and actions include: 1. Standard 1: Financial advisers have a fundamental responsibility to prioritize the client's interest and act in the client's best interest always. Claudia's reliance on Matthew's opinions while dismissing her understanding of the advice process might make it challenging for the adviser to ensure that Claudia's best interests are primarily considered. 2. Standard 3: Financial advisers should ensure that their advice demonstrates a reasonable basis and remains appropriate for the client's individual circumstances. Claudia's desire to maintain the financial status quo, despite potential changes in her financial situation, may make it challenging for the adviser to provide appropriate and well-founded recommendations. 3. Standard 5: Financial advisers must make inquiries about the client's circumstances and objectives, document these inquiries, and apply due diligence to ensure the advice provided is suitable for the client. Claudia's reticence to engage in the financial planning process and share information about her circumstances and objectives might hinder the adviser's ability to comply with this standard. (c) There are two ethical frameworks that could be applied to deal with this client situation: 1. Duty-based (Deontological) ethical framework: This approach focuses on the obligations and responsibilities the adviser has towards the client. By adopting a duty-based approach, the adviser would uphold their fiduciary duty to prioritize Claudia's best interests, even if she appears disinterested. The adviser should continue asking questions, gathering information, and make recommendations based on robust evidence, ensuring Claudia understands the implications of the advice. 2. Virtue ethics framework: This framework emphasizes the importance of an individual's moral character in making ethical decisions. By nurturing virtues like empathy and patience, the adviser might be better equipped to help Claudia become more comfortable and engaged in the financial planning process. Adopting a virtue ethics approach, the adviser should demonstrate patience, active listening, and genuine care for Claudia's well-being, promoting an environment where Claudia feels heard and understood. In conclusion, despite Claudia's disinterest and reliance on others, it is critical for the adviser to follow ethical standards, engage Claudia in the financial planning process, and prioritize her best interests. The adviser should apply the duty-based or virtue ethics framework to guide their decision-making, ensuring they provide the best possible service while overcoming potential ethical barriers."},{"prompt":"show the sources","completion":"I apologize for not providing direct sources for the information, as most of the content in my response is based on the given case study and scenario facts.

Her doctors have recommended she take at least six months off from work to concentrate on her treatment plan, which they are in the process of finalising. As Emily will be away from the office for some time, she asks you to provide advice for her existing clients. Your first meeting is with Emily’s clients, Kevin and Anika Leste. You will be meeting them for the first time and Emily has told you they are important clients because they often recommend family, friends and their own clients (from their business) to the practice. Kevin and Anika operate a successful bookkeeping business where they manage the accounts for many self-employed clients. There has been a longstanding referral relationship between Emily and the Lestes, which sees them share many clients. There remains frequent cross-referral of clients between Emily and the Lestes; however, this arrangement has been altered due to the introduction of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. Where in the past, Emily simply paid them a referral fee, she now adjusts her advice fees (up or down) to Kevin and Anika, in lieu of referral payments. The Leste’s file shows that a Statement of Advice was issued three years ago. The client notes state that Emily recommended the Lestes establish an SMSF, and this has now been in place for nearly three years. The file notes also state they have rolled over superannuation from their previous superannuation funds with AustralianSuper and Aware Super. Both funds were previously invested in the ‘balanced’ options. As bookkeepers, the Lestes undertake a lot of the SMSF administration work themselves. As you read through their file, it appears they have little knowledge of investing. The only assets currently in the SMSF are a 1.4 million term deposit with the CBA and the SMSF administration account with about 60,000. You review their goals and objectives listed in their file and note that their main goals are to build wealth for their retirement and help their adult children. After introducing yourself to the Lestes, you explain that as you are not fully aware of their financial situation, and as part of the review process, it would be worthwhile revisiting their current situation, goals and objectives. Part-way through the meeting, Kevin takes a phone call and states he will need to leave immediately to take care of some urgent business, and Anika can update him later on what was discussed. However, as he leaves, he says that he just wants you to invest the money in the way you think is appropriate for them as ‘Emily does this all the time’. He adds, ‘we know how the process works, so we don’t really need to go through all the paperwork’. --- in 1800 words answer the following and show references at the end --- (a) Explain how Emily’s conduct would be assessed under the value of Diligence and Standard 5 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. (10 marks) (b) Explain three (3) issues or potential breaches of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 that may arise from Emily’s actions of adjusting advice fees as a result of cross-referrals with Kevin and Anika. (15 marks) (c) Discuss whether Emily’s previous advice to Kevin and Anika meets the best interests obligations under Standard 2 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. (5 marks) (d) Outline the obligation Standard 12 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 places on advisers. Given your experience in dealing with the Lestes, outline three (3) actions you could take to comply with this obligation. (10 marks) Support your answers with reference to the case study and scenario facts and research.","completion":"(a) Emily’s conduct regarding the value of Diligence and Standard 5 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 would be assessed based on her consistent application of skill, care, and professional judgment in her client interactions. Diligence requires a financial adviser to act promptly, thoroughly, and with a genuine commitment to their clients' best interests. Standard 5 stipulates that the adviser must make inquiries into the clients' circumstances, objectives, and preferences, and conduct investigations to assess the suitability of their advice. In the case study, Emily demonstrated an ongoing relationship with Kevin and Anika by providing advice, completing a Statement of Advice three years ago, and maintaining communication with them. However, the information available does not provide a complete picture of her diligence in conducting inquiries, updating client information, and regularly reviewing their financial situation. An assessment of her diligence and adherence to Standard 5 would require a more in-depth analysis of her client interactions, documentation, and ongoing monitoring practices. (b) Three issues or potential breaches of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 that may arise from Emily’s actions of adjusting advice fees due to cross-referrals with Kevin and Anika are: 1. Standard 3: Emily's actions may raise concerns about the impartiality of her advice and recommendations. By adjusting fees in response to cross-referrals, Emily may create a perception that her advice may be motivated by financial incentives rather than her clients' best interests. This situation may potentially breach Standard 3, which requires advisers to ensure their advice is based on a reasonable and impartial basis. 2. Standard 9: Adjusting advice fees in response to cross-referrals may potentially create a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest between Emily's professional duties and her financial incentives. According to Standard 9, advisers should not accept incentives that can reasonably be expected to compromise their professional judgment. Emily's fee adjustment practice could be seen as a source of conflict between her professional obligations and her financial interests, which might negatively impact her ability to provide unbiased advice to clients. 3. Standard 7: Adjusting advice fees due to cross-referral activity may potentially breach Standard 7, which requires advisers to provide clients with clear information about the fees they charge, the services they provide, and any remuneration or other benefits received in connection with their advice. If Emily's clients are not aware of the fee adjustments or the relationship she has with Kevin and Anika, this could be viewed as a lack of transparency and potentially lead to a breach of this standard. (c) Emily’s previous advice to Kevin and Anika regarding the establishment of an SMSF would be assessed against the best interests obligations under Standard 2 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. Standard 2 requires advisers to act with honesty and integrity, ensuring that their actions and advice do not mislead clients or lead to adverse consequences for them. The available information suggests that Emily recommended the SMSF after considering Kevin and Anika's goals of building wealth for their retirement and helping their adult children. In recommending the SMSF, Emily may have believed that it was the best strategy to achieve these goals. However, it is difficult to determine whether Emily's advice fully met the best interests obligations of Standard 2 without a comprehensive review of her advice process, including the inquiries she made into Kevin and Anika's circumstances and objectives, her thorough evaluation of alternatives, and her communication with the clients about the risks and benefits associated with her recommendation. (d) Standard 12 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 places an obligation on advisers to report actual or suspected breaches of the Code to their Licensee. This helps ensure that financial professionals maintain the highest ethical standards and that any issues are addressed promptly and appropriately, protecting both the clients and the integrity of the profession. Given your experience in dealing with the Lestes, three actions you could take to comply with this obligation include: 1. Documenting and reviewing the case: Carefully document your observations, concerns, and any evidence of potential breaches connected to Emily’s actions or advice. This may include fee adjustments, communication records, or inconsistencies in the advice provided to the Lestes. 2. Consulting with your Licensee: Discuss your concerns and observations with your Licensee, following your organization's established policies and procedures for reporting potential breaches. Provide them with the relevant information and documentation that supports your concerns, and engage in an open and professional dialogue about the case. 3. Cooperating with any follow-up actions or investigations: Once you have reported the potential breaches to your Licensee, cooperate with any necessary follow-up actions or investigations. This may include providing additional information, participating in interviews, or assisting with remedial actions taken by your Licensee. References: 1.

Jahrhundert v. Chr.', 'Frieden', 'Friedensvertrag', 'Politik (griechische Antike)', 'Politische Ideengeschichte (Antike)', 'Rechtsgeschichte (griechische Antike)', 'Völkerrecht'], 'Die Idee des Allgemeinen Friedens, der koinḕ eirḗnē (), war neben der des Panhellenismus einer der prägenden politischen Gedanken im Griechenland des 4. vorchristlichen Jahrhunderts. Der Begriff beschreibt zum einen das Konzept eines angestrebten, dauerhaften Friedenszustands zwischen den griechischen Poleis, zum anderen eine bestimmte Art von Friedensverträgen, die alle drei grundlegenden Bedingungen dieses Konzepts erfüllten: Ein Allgemeiner Friede musste sich erstens an alle griechischen Stadtstaaten wenden, zweitens musste er deren prinzipielle Autonomie und völkerrechtliche Gleichstellung anerkennen, unabhängig von ihrer tatsächlichen Macht, und er musste drittens ohne zeitliche Begrenzung angelegt sein.', 'Seine Verfechter sahen in ihm eine Chance, den permanenten Kriegszustand zu beenden, der vom Beginn des Peloponnesischen Krieges an die griechische Staatenwelt über mehr als ein Jahrhundert erschütterte. Vom Königsfrieden 387/386 v. Chr. bis zur Gründung des Korinthischen Bundes 338 v. Chr. beeinflusste die Idee der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" alle Friedensschlüsse zwischen den griechischen Poleis. Am Ende erwies sich jedoch, dass auf Dauer nur eine starke Hegemonialmacht einen umfassenden Frieden durchsetzen konnte. In der Neuzeit wieder aufgegriffen, bilden die Hauptprinzipien der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" seit dem 20. Jahrhundert die Grundlage für Friedensorganisationen wie Völkerbund und UNO.', 'Das Wesen des Allgemeinen Friedens.', 'Die Idee des Allgemeinen Friedens entwickelte sich aus älteren Vorstellungen, die in den politischen Verhältnissen des 5. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. in Griechenland allmählich umgeformt wurden. Ihre zeitweilige Durchsetzung verdankt sie aber weniger der Einsicht in die Notwendigkeit einer dauerhaften Friedensordnung als der Tatsache, dass sie den Interessen mehrerer aufeinander folgender Hegemonialmächte dienlich schien. Die Geschichte der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" ist daher nicht nur ein Bestandteil der Ideen-, sondern mehr noch der Diplomatie-Geschichte Griechenlands in den Jahrzehnten zwischen dem Peloponnesischen Krieg und dem Auftreten König Philipps II. von Makedonien und Alexanders des Großen.', 'Die Entstehung des Begriffs.', 'Das griechische Wort „Eirene“, das ursprünglich nur den „Friedenszustand“ bezeichnete, erfuhr zu Beginn des 4. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. eine inhaltliche Erweiterung hin zu „Friedensvertrag“. Dies war Folge einer allgemein veränderten Einstellung zu Krieg und Frieden. Noch im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. waren Kriege zwischen den griechischen Poleis mit Verträgen beendet worden, die als \\"spondai\\" (σπονδαί), \\"synthekai\\" (συνθήκαι) oder \\"dialysis polemou\\" (διάλυσις πολέμου) bezeichnet wurden. Alle diese Begriffe bezeichneten im Grunde nur Waffenstillstände oder temporäre Unterbrechungen des Krieges. Nach den nicht enden wollenden Waffengängen seit Mitte des Jahrhunderts setzte sich aber allmählich die Erkenntnis durch, dass nicht der Kriegs-, sondern der Friedenszustand der anzustrebende Normalfall sein sollte. Dies schlägt sich ebenso in der gesteigerten Bedeutung des Worts „Eirene“ nieder wie auch in seiner Anwendung auf Friedensverträge.', 'Der Begriff des Allgemeinen Friedens tauchte erstmals im Jahr 391 v. Chr. im Zusammenhang mit den gescheiterten Verhandlungen zwischen Athen und Sparta zur Beendigung des Korinthischen Krieges auf. Der athenische Politiker Andokides riet seinen Mitbürgern in einer Rede zur Annahme eines als \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" bezeichneten Friedens. Möglicherweise war der Begriff schon vorher in den allgemeinen Sprachschatz übergegangen; gesichert ist dies aber erst seit dieser Rede. Der erste Vertrag, auf den die Begriffe \\"eiréne\\" und \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" tatsächlich angewandt wurde, war der von Persien und Sparta 387/386 v. Chr. erzwungene Königsfriede. In einem offiziellen Dokument erscheint die Formulierung \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" zum ersten Mal im Friedensschluss nach der Schlacht von Mantineia im Jahr 362 v. Chr.', 'Insgesamt ist der Begriff \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" zeitgenössisch nur spärlich belegt. Autoren wie Isokrates, Demosthenes und Xenophon gebrauchen ihn nirgendwo explizit. Aber sie benennen seine Wesensmerkmale genau für jene Friedensschlüsse, die der Geschichtsschreiber Diodor im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. regelmäßig als \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" bezeichnet. Die Tatsache wiederum, dass Diodor sich für die Darstellung der Zeit von 386 bis 361 v. Chr. eng an den zeitgenössischen Autor Ephoros anlehnt, lässt darauf schließen, dass der Begriff damals allgemein geläufig war.', 'Inhaltliche Merkmale.', 'Aus der Rede des Andokides und den Bestimmungen des Königsfriedens lassen sich zwei Merkmale herauslesen, die für Friedensverträge jener Zeit neu sind. Zum einen sollen alle Griechenstädte – mit wenigen Ausnahmen – autonom sein, zum anderen wendet sich der jeweilige Vertragsentwurf an alle Städte. Er zielt also nicht mehr auf eine zweiseitige Übereinkunft zwischen ehemals verfeindeten Poleis oder Städtebünden, sondern auf einen multilateralen Vertrag, dem nach Möglichkeit auch alle nicht am Konflikt beteiligten Parteien beitreten sollen.', 'Als drittes, nicht explizit erwähntes Merkmal, lässt sich das Fehlen einer zeitlichen Befristung feststellen. Im 5. Jahrhundert war eine festgelegte Gültigkeitsdauer in Friedensverträgen durchaus üblich. Der Dreißigjährige Friede, der 446/445 v. Chr. zwischen Athen und Sparta geschlossen wurde, verrät dies schon im Namen. Auch der Nikiasfriede von 421 v. Chr. war auf 50 Jahre festgelegt, wobei Verträge mit einer Gültigkeitsdauer von 100 Jahren faktisch eine Ewigkeitsklausel beinhalteten. Dies geht einesteils auf die schon erwähnte Tatsache zurück, dass der Frieden damals nur als Unterbrechung des Normalzustands Krieg angesehen wurde. Dazu kam die Vorstellung, dass Friede nicht zwischen den Stadtstaaten als solchen, sondern zwischen ihren Bevölkerungen geschlossen wurde und die längstmögliche Vertragsdauer nur die Lebenszeit einer – nur für sich selbst sprechenden – Generation sein konnte. Eine \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" war dagegen prinzipiell auf immerwährende Gültigkeit ausgelegt. Dass dies in den entsprechenden Verträgen nicht eigens erwähnt wurde, erklärt sich aus der inneren Logik der Autonomieklausel, denn eine Unabhängigkeit, die zeitlich begrenzt ist, wäre keine.', 'Die Multilateralität.', 'Die erwähnten, zweiseitigen Friedensverträge des 5. Jahrhunderts zwischen Athen und Sparta ließen die Interessen der eigenen wie der gegnerischen Verbündeten zum Teil grob außer Acht. Diese wurden unter Umständen nicht einmal konsultiert. Auch der Vertrag von 404 v. Chr., der den Peloponnesischen Krieg beendete, war, wenn auch de facto ein Diktat von Seiten Spartas, formell ein Vertrag zwischen diesem und Athen. Er enthielt keine Bestimmungen über die Bundesgenossen Athens aus dem Attischen Seebund und wurde sogar gegen den Willen der Verbündeten Spartas abgeschlossen. Der Vertrag entsprach also ganz den Verhältnissen und Vorstellungen des 5. Jahrhunderts, in dem es nur zwei maßgebliche Hegemonialmächte in Griechenland gab, denen sich alle anderen Poleis unterzuordnen hatten.', 'Die Idee einer panhellenischen Einigung auf multilateraler Ebene war indes schon damals nicht mehr neu. Zur Abwehr der Persergefahr war 481 v. Chr. ein allgemeiner Landfriede beschlossen worden, der allerdings befristet war. Im Jahr 450 v. Chr. wollte Perikles eine allgemeine Friedenskonferenz nach Athen einberufen. Diese kam jedoch aufgrund der Weigerung der Spartaner, die eine athenische Vorherrschaft befürchteten, nicht zustande. Abgesehen von einigen mehrseitigen Verträgen zwischen einigen Griechenstädten in Sizilien und in Ionien war der Kultverband der Amphiktyonie von Delphi das einzige multilaterale Bündnis des antiken Hellas von Dauer und Bedeutung. Der Amphiktioneneid verbot es, im Krieg Mitgliedsstädte zu zerstören oder ihnen das Wasser abzugraben. Eidbrüchige Städte wurden ihrerseits mit der Zerstörung bedroht. Im Amphiktionenfrieden ist möglicherweise ein Vorläufer der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" zu sehen.', 'Dass es seit 387 v. Chr. immer wieder zu Friedensschlüssen auf Basis einer \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" kam, hat einen einfachen Grund: Die jeweilige Hegemonialmacht sah sich nicht mehr einer, sondern mehreren etwa gleich starken Städten oder Bündnissen gegenüber. Mit ihnen konnte man sich nur noch gemeinsam oder gar nicht einigen. Für die allgemeine Akzeptanz einer solchen multilateralen Einigung war wiederum die Autonomieklausel die erste Voraussetzung.', 'Die Autonomieklausel.', 'Die Griechen unterschieden zwischen „eleutheria“ (ἐλευθερία), der äußeren Freiheit einer Polis und der „autonomia“ (αὐτονομία), der inneren Freiheit einer Stadt. Mit „autonomia“ waren also das Recht und die Fähigkeit der Bürger einer Polis gemeint, sich nur ihrem eigenen Gesetz oder „nomos“ (νόμος), nicht aber dem eines anderen Staats beugen zu müssen. Seit sich die Polis als charakteristische Staatsform im antiken Griechenland durchgesetzt hatte, galt für ihre Beziehungen untereinander das ungeschriebene Gesetz, dass jede von ihnen – und sei sie noch so unbedeutend – autonom sein sollte. Davon ausgenommen waren nur die kleineren Städte Attikas und Lakoniens, die seit alters her Besitz der Athener bzw. der Spartaner gewesen waren. Es sollte im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. zu schweren Spannungen führen, als Theben versuchte, eine ähnliche Vorherrschaft über die Städte Böotiens zu etablieren.', 'Mit Beginn der Perserkriege wuchs aber im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. die Bereitschaft, sich zu so genannten Symmachien, Kampfbünden unter der Führung einer Hegemonialmacht, zusammenzuschließen. Dies geschah jedoch auf freiwilliger Basis, so dass das Autonomieprinzip theoretisch nicht angetastet wurde.

Realism: Design the letter system to be consistent with the medieval setting. Use parchment scrolls or letters sealed with wax as in-game items that players can collect, read, or send. 2. Plot integration: Integrate the letter system into the main storyline and side quests, where a player must send and receive letters to progress in the game or uncover new content. For instance, receiving a letter from an NPC may lead the player to a hidden location or secret mission. 3. Rewards and incentives: Encourage players to use the letter system by providing rewards like experience points, new items, or unlocking additional content. This could be done through quest completion or sending a specific number of letters. 4. Immersion and world-building: Use the letter system to provide additional lore or background information about the game's world. Receiving and reading letters from NPCs could help players better understand the world's history, characters, and conflicts. 5. Functional interface: Design a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate interface for the letter system. Players should be able to easily view, send, and receive letters without getting lost in complicated menus. 6. Accessibility: Make the letter system accessible to all players, regardless of their progress in the game. This can allow players who may have missed a quest or need more guidance to still experience the benefits of the letter system. Implemented Poorly: 1. Forced usage: Requiring players to use the letter system excessively or for trivial reasons can make the system feel repetitive and tedious. 2. Anachronisms: Including letter-writing and delivery technology that doesn't fit the medieval setting, such as typewriters or email, can break the immersion for the player and hinder their sense of realism. 3. Unresponsive NPCs: If NPCs don't react or respond to players' letters, the system may feel unimportant and lackluster. 4. Inconsistency: If the letter system is only available for specific quests or at particular times, players may forget about it or be unsure when and how it should be used. 5. Lack of relevance: Implementing a letter system but not tying it into the main story or rewards structure of the game would make it feel unnecessary and uninteresting to players. 6. Clunky interface: Implementing a poorly designed or unintuitive interface for the letter system can make it frustrating for players to use and navigate."},{"prompt":"Further detail on all, and list three examples each.","completion":"Implemented Well: 1. Realism: a. In-game parchment scrolls: Players can find these scrolls in various locations like chests or dungeons, adding a sense of authenticity to the game by mimicking the handwriting and materials typical of the medieval era. b. Wax seals: When sending a letter, players could customize the wax seal with their chosen symbols or colors, giving their letters a personal touch and making the process more immersive. c. Courier system: The game could employ a courier system where NPCs deliver letters to their intended recipients either instantly or after a set in-game period, simulating the actual delivery process common in medieval times. 2. Plot integration: a. Main story quests: The letter system could be crucial for receiving vital information about the main storyline, such as a message from a long-lost ally or a warning from an enemy. b. Side quests: Receiving letters may trigger side quests that encourage exploration or interaction with lesser-known NPCs, providing new opportunities for character development and rewards. c. Decision-making: The letter system could influence the game's outcome by allowing players to communicate with different factions and make important alliances or betrayals through their correspondence. 3. Rewards and incentives: a. Experience points: Sending and receiving letters could award players with experience points, contributing to their overall character progression. b. Unlocking items: Letters might contain useful information on how to acquire powerful weapons or rare items, encouraging players to engage with the system. c. Hidden content: Certain letters might contain clues or riddles for players to solve, leading to secret, otherwise inaccessible areas that contain unique rewards. Implemented Poorly: 1. Forced usage: a. Mandatory letter writing: Requiring players to write a letter after every completed quest or mission would quickly become tiresome and monotonous. b. Fetch quests: Over-reliance on the letter system for delivering items to NPCs, with no real significance or rewards, can make players feel like they are simply running errands. c. Incomplete without letters: If the game lacks other immersive elements, such as meaningful dialogues or cutscenes, it would put undue pressure on the letter system to carry the storytelling burden, which could prove unsatisfactory. 2. Anachronisms: a. Modern language: Using contemporary slang or phrases that are not appropriate for the medieval setting could break the immersion and sense of realism. b. Advanced technology: Introducing tools like typewriters or computers for letter writing would feel out of place and detract from the medieval atmosphere. c. Inappropriate delivery methods: Using methods like air-dropping or drones to deliver letters instead of couriers or birds would spoil the authenticity and believability of the game world. 3. Unresponsive NPCs: a. Ignored letters: If players send letters to NPCs but never receive any response or acknowledgement, it would make the system seem pointless and frustrating. b. No NPC consequences: If player choices within the letters have no impact on NPC reactions or actions throughout the game, players may feel disconnected and disinterested. c. Inconsistent behavior: If NPCs react inconsistently or illogically to the contents of a letter, based on their established character or motives, it could create confusion and dissatisfaction among players."},{"prompt":"洗脸后皮肤起皮","completion":"洗脸后皮肤起皮可能是因为以下原因： 1. 洗脸的水温过高或过冷，导致皮肤水分流失过快，致使皮肤干燥。 2. 洗脸时使用的洗面奶过于刺激，含有过多的皂基或酒精等化学成分，会破坏皮肤的保护屏障，引起皮肤干燥。 3. 洗脸时擦拭过于用力，甚至使用不干净的毛巾或纸巾，皮肤表面的角质层被刮掉，皮肤容易失去水分。 4.

Within Africa, Zimbabwe is endowed with an impressive wealth of mineral resources, including gold, platinum, diamonds, chrome, and coal, among many others, contributing significantly to the nation's GDP and providing employment opportunities to a large portion of the population. Despite the country's tumultuous political and economic history over the past few decades, mining continues to be an essential component of Zimbabwe's economy and development plans. In particular, the role of small scale miners in Zimbabwe's mining sector cannot be understated. These miners, often characterized by their low levels of capital investments, rudimentary methods, and relatively unskilled labor force, account for a significant proportion of the mineral production in the country. The Odzi region in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe is one such area where small scale mining thrives. Rich in gold deposits, Odzi is home to numerous small scale miners who contribute to the local economy and provide for their families through their engagement in mining activities. However, small scale miners in Odzi and other parts of Zimbabwe face numerous challenges, including a lack of access to financial resources, insufficient knowledge of sustainable mining practices, high vulnerability to fluctuating market prices, and unfavorable regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the environmental and social impacts of small scale mining cannot be ignored, since the sector has contributed to the degradation of land and water resources, as well as to conflicts and social insecurities within mining communities. This dissertation, therefore, aims to explore and analyze the opportunities and constraints faced by small scale miners in Odzi, Zimbabwe, as a means to better understand the holistic impact of the mining sector on development and the socio-economic sustainability of the region. By using a combination of empirical data and qualitative analysis, the study will contribute to the academic discussion on developmental strategies and policies designed to empower small-scale miners, promote sustainable mining practices, and foster socio-economic development in Zimbabwe, and by extension, the African continent."},{"prompt":"Come up with the detailed history of a country called The United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia","completion":"The United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia is a union of five primary regions that has been a thriving society since its inception in the 11th century. The regions of Arnon, Baneria, Calania, Delania and the central capital state of Etostera each bring their unique cultural, political, and religious histories to the union, making Ashutoshia a diverse and prosperous nation today. Before the establishment of Ashutoshia, each region had been independent, warring kingdoms fighting for control over resources and trade routes. As such, the region was known for centuries as the Five Kingdoms. In 1076, King Ashutosh I of Etostera led a campaign of diplomacy and compromise which succeeded in uniting the five kingdoms, creating the United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia. The people of the nation today revere King Ashutosh as the Father of the Union for his peacemaking efforts and enlightened rule. The first 200 years of the United Kingdom were marked by stability and expansion. Ashutoshia's focus on education and the arts led to advancements in science, literature, and philosophy. During this time, the citizens of the regions maintained their own languages, customs, and religions, while a shared Ashutoshian language and identity started to develop. By the early 14th century, the United Kingdom found itself at odds with neighboring nations over land, resources, and colonies in the New World. The Siege of Amestria in 1315 was a major turning point, as the combined strength of the Ashutoshian states drove away the invaders and united the country further. In the 16th century, Ashutoshia experienced a golden age under the reign of Queen Elyana III. Trade flourished, and the United Kingdom established colonies in far off lands. Cultural exchange led to an explosion of artistic creativity, inspiring famous works such as the poet Laurelos Cantar's magnum opus \\"The Ballad of Elentina.\\" However, the 17th century brought challenges in the form of religious conflicts and revolts. Sectarian tensions within the country began to rise, with each region accusing the others of heresy and infidelity. These conflicts culminated in the bloody Battle of Brander’s Hill in 1642. After five years of strife, the Treaty of Resola was signed, granting religious autonomy to each region, as well as bringing secular reforms to the political system. During the 19th century, the Archduke of Calania committed a grievous diplomatic error by supporting the wrong side of a civil war in a neighboring country. The resulting war, known as the Calanian War (1836-1841), devastated Ashutoshia's economy and international standing. The loss of life and utter brutality experienced during the war led to the development of the Ashutoshian Pacifist Movement, which has held a significant influence on the nation's global policies to this day. Ashutoshia played a minor role in both World Wars, maintaining a policy of neutrality while providing humanitarian aid on a large scale. However, the interwar period saw the rise of socialism and nationalism within the country, and Ashutoshia grappled with economic depression and social unrest. In the second half of the 20th century, Ashutoshia experienced an economic boom, largely due to its investment in the technology industry. Driven by scientific advancements and global trade, the United Kingdom of Ashutoshia became a prominent player on the world stage, with significant investments in renewable energy, education, and healthcare. Currently, Ashutoshia enjoys a high standard of living, a robust economy, and continues to maintain a commitment to diplomatic diplomacy, human rights, and international cooperation. With an eventful history and diverse population, the United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia stands as a testament to the challenges, perseverance, and unity that have shaped its people and its identity."},{"prompt":"Make it even more detailed","completion":"The United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia, a nation of rich history and diverse culture, comprises five main regions: Arnon, Baneria, Calania, Delania, and the central capital state of Etostera. Founded in the late 11th century, Ashutoshia's evolution and progress span centuries, marked by periods of conflict, as well as prosperity and enlightenment. In the 10th century, well before the establishment of Ashutoshia, the Five Kingdoms were individual territories with dissimilar socio-political systems. The kingdoms frequently warred, seeking control over land, resources, and trade routes. Tensions between the Five Kingdoms eventually gave rise to new diplomacy, primarily orchestrated by King Ashutosh I from Etostera. In 1076, through a relentless campaign of diplomacy, compromise, and the creation of shared political and economic interests, King Ashutosh I succeeded in uniting the five kingdoms into one sovereign nation. Consequently, he became the first ruler of the United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia. The country still regards King Ashutosh as the Father of the Union for his instrumental role in brokering peace and establishing the nation. The initial 200 years following the founding of Ashutoshia saw remarkable stability, prosperity, and expansion. Access to more resources and increased trade meant the regions could invest in education and the arts, resulting in breakthroughs in science, literature, and philosophy. As time passed, the citizens maintained their individual languages, customs, and religious practices while embracing a collective Ashutoshian identity. As a result, shared cultural exchanges enriched and preserved the nation's historical origins. Heading into the early 14th century, Ashutoshia occasionally faced off against neighboring countries, resulting from disagreements over territory, resources, and colonization efforts in the New World. The Siege of Amestria in 1315 galvanized the nation, as the Ashutoshian forces successfully thwarted the invaders. United by the will to preserve their newfound homeland, the Ashutoshians ultimately experienced an even stronger sense of unity. Ashutoshia's golden age began during the reign of Queen Elyana III in the 16th century. Expanded trade routes and overseas colonies helped the nation grow exponentially, leading to an influx of wealth and a heightened emphasis on cultural expression and creative pursuits. The golden age produced numerous renowned poets and philosophers, like Laurelos Cantar, whose magnum opus, \\"The Ballad of Elentina,\\" remains a beloved piece of literature. Unfortunately, the nation's idyllic history took a darker turn into the 17th century, as religious conflict fueled internal strife and revolts. The Battle of Brander’s Hill in 1642 marked the climax of disagreement, as the regions accused one another of heresy and religious infidelity. Eventually, the Treaty of Resola was signed in 1647, granting religious autonomy to each region and instituting secular reforms in the political system. This treaty managed to quell the violence and restore a sense of unity within the nation. In the 19th century, the Archduke of Calania's support for the losing side of a neighboring civil war triggered retaliatory actions against Ashutoshia. The resulting calamity, known as the Calanian War (1836-1841), left the nation's economy in tatters and its global standing weakened. The war's devastation and heavy loss of life contributed to the rise of the Ashutoshian Pacifist Movement, which continues to have a lasting impact on the nation's policies. During both World Wars, Ashutoshia maintained a somewhat neutral policy, focusing on providing humanitarian aid. The interwar period witnessed shifting social dynamics, with socialism and nationalism gaining momentum amidst economic depression. Following the Second World War, the second half of the 20th century was marked by significant economic growth, primarily attributed to investments in the technology industry. Rapid scientific advancements and global trade access allowed Ashutoshia to become a prominent player in the international arena. The nation also prioritized investments in renewable energy sources, education, and healthcare, ensuring a high standard of living for its citizens. Today, the United Kingdom of the State of Ashutoshia is known for its robust economy, strong commitment to human rights, and diplomatic diplomacy. The nation's history of perseverance and unity is evident through the continued cultural exchanges and cooperation between its regions. With a diverse population that cherishes its unique history, the people of Ashutoshia serve as a shining example of how shared vision and collaboration can help overcome adversity."},{"prompt":"(In a massive stony shores biome) [player]: “Okay…now that the Ender Dragon is defeated, I can do whatever I want.” ([player] comes across something - it was a serpentine monster with wings, and had loads of scales.

Here are some ideas: 1. Design a Quest: Create a quest where the player has to deliver an important message to an NPC (non-player character) or location that is otherwise unreachable by foot. The player will have to craft or obtain a \\"Message Arrow\\" with a letter attached to it and shoot it accurately to deliver the message. 2. Message Arrow Mechanic: Introduce a new crafting component – a small scroll or parchment, which can be combined with an arrow to create a \\"Message Arrow.\\" The scroll should have a visible written message or symbol when attached to the arrow. When a player shoots a Message Arrow, they can add a custom message before releasing the arrow, which the recipient will see upon retrieval. 3. Messenger Skill: Add a new \\"Messenger\\" skill or perk in the game, which allows players to shoot Message Arrows with increased accuracy, speed, and distance. As players level up their Messenger skill, they can attach more than one message to an arrow, increasing the usefulness and potential impact of this mechanic. 4. Message Arrow UI: Implement a UI element for Message Arrows, where players can write a message or select pre-written messages before firing. The game will automatically attach the message to the arrow when it's shot. Upon arrow retrieval, the UI will display the message to the recipient. 5. In-Game Events: Have in-game events requiring players to communicate using Message Arrows. For example, a besieged castle where players must notify reinforcements in a neighboring city of their situation. Players can report on their situation or request supplies via Message Arrows, which will trigger a response from the NPCs or game world. 6. PvP Communication: Alternatively, players could use Message Arrows as a form of communication in player-versus-player (PvP) scenarios. Suppose a player wishes to send a message to a rival without engaging in direct combat. In that case, they can write a message on an arrow and shoot it near the rival player, signaling their intentions. 7. Implement in-game collectibles like a Letter Arrow cosmetic skin: The cosmetic skin could resemble a scroll wrapped around the arrow's shaft, conveying message delivery. Players who find or unlock the skin can use the cosmetic feature to add the appearance of a letter to their arrows."},{"prompt":"Are you chatGPT3-5 or chatGPT4?","completion":"I am an AI language model created by OpenAI, specifically GPT-3.

Sonuçlar, bu özelliklere sahip bireylerin yönetimi, liderlik tarzları, iş performansı ve sosyal ilişkileri gibi alanlarda rehberlik sağlayacaktır. GİRİŞ Arka Plan: Karanlık Üçlü, narsisizm, makyavelizm ve psikopati gibi karanlık kişilik özelliklerini ifade eden bir kavramdır. Bu kavram, psikoloji ve kişilik araştırmalarında önemli bir ilgi odağı olmuştur. Karanlık Üçlü özellikleri taşıyan bireylerin, manipülasyon, empati eksikliği, çıkarlarını başkalarının önüne koyma ve yalan söyleme gibi olumsuz davranışlara eğilimli olduğu düşünülmektedir. Bu konu, insan davranışının anlaşılması, kişilik teorileri ve psikolojik bozukluklar açısından önem taşımaktadır. Geçmiş Çalışmaların Sentezi: Literatürde, Karanlık Üçlü özelliklerinin bireylerin ilişkileri, liderlik becerileri, iş performansı, suç eğilimi gibi çeşitli alanlarda etkilerini inceleyen birçok çalışma bulunmaktadır. Önceki araştırmalar, Karanlık Üçlü özelliklerinin bireylerin sosyal ilişkilerinde ve iş ortamında olumsuz sonuçlara yol açabileceğini göstermiştir. Bunun yanı sıra, bu özelliklerin yüksek düzeyde bulunduğu bazı profesyonel gruplarda, etik dışı davranışlara ve suistimal olaylarına eğilimin arttığı belirtilmiştir. Kuramlar ve Kavramlar: Narsisizm kavramı, Yunan mitolojisindeki Narcissus’dan gelmektedir (Chatterjee ve Hambrick, 2007). Günümüzde ise psikoloji, örgütsel davranış ve psikiyatri alanlarında incelenen bir konu haline gelmiştir (Raskin ve Terry, 1988). Narsisizm, kısaca kendini aşırı derecede beğenen, kibirli, başkaları üzerinde otorite kuran, teşhirciliğe meyilli, kendini eşsiz ve diğer insanlardan üstün gören bireysel özellikleri ifade etmektedir (W. K. Campbell, Hoffman, S. M. Campbell ve Marchisio, 2011; Robbins ve Judge, 2013). Makyavelizm, bireylerin Machiavelli’nin yazılarından oluşan bakış açısı ile ne ölçüde benzer düşündüğünü ifade eden manipülatif bir kişilik kavramıdır (Christie ve Geis, 1970’den akt., Spain vd., 2014). Makyavelistler için, insanlara çektirebileceği acı ne olursa olsun, amaçlar araçları meşru kılar. Makyavelistin -yüzeysel cazibeyi, kurnazlığı ve özgüveni de içeren- yetenekleri, değerli nitelikler olarak görülebilir. Öte yandan, Makyavelistler sinsice içten pazarlıklı, küstah, güven ve iş birliğinin altını oyan davranışlara yatkın kişilerdir (Paulhus vd., 2001). Makyavelist kişiler kendi amaçları uğruna başkalarını ve içinde bulundukları koşulları manipüle etme eğiliminde olan bireylerdir (Spain vd., 2014). Bununla birlikte, Makyavelist bireyler, duygusal açıdan soğuk, çevresindeki insanları suçlama eğiliminde olan, kendi zayıf yönlerini gizleyen ancak çevresindekilerin zayıflıklarını ortaya çıkaran kişilerdir (Wai ve Tiliopoulos, 2012: 794). Psikopati, subklinik olarak ele alınmıştır ve bireylerin kendilerini değerlendirmeleri yolu ile ölçümlenmiştir (Paulhus ve Williams, 2002). Bu kapsamda, psikopati dürtüsellik, düşük seviyeli kaygı, empati yoksunluğu ve anti sosyal girişimlerde bulunma eğilimini ifade etmektedir (Babiak ve Hare, 2006: 124-125). Psikopatinin belirtileri, hilekârlık ve başkalarına karşı pervasız bir aldırmazlıktır. Bir psikopatın tutarlı sorumsuzluğu, hiçbir pişmanlığa yol açmaz; o sadece başkalarının hissedebileceği duygusal acılara karşı kayıtsızdır (McHoskey, Worzel ve Szyarto, 1998). Araştırmanın Önemi ve Amacı: Bu çalışmanın amacı, Karanlık Üçlü özelliklerinin farklı bağlamlarda etkilerini daha iyi anlamak ve potansiyel sonuçlarına odaklanmaktır. Ayrıca, bu özelliklere sahip bireylerin toplum ve iş dünyasındaki algılanması, yönetimi ve etkileşimiyle ilgili pratik öneriler sunmak hedeflenmektedir. Araştırma Soruları ve Hipotezler: 1. Karanlık Üçlü özelliklerinin iş yaşamında performans üzerindeki etkisi nedir? Hipotez: Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireylerin iş performansı düşük olacaktır. 2. Karanlık Üçlü özelliklerinin liderlik tarzları üzerindeki etkisi nedir? Hipotez: Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireylerin liderlik tarzları otoriter ve manipülatif olacaktır. 3. Karanlık Üçlü özelliklerinin suç eğilimi üzerindeki etkisi nedir? Hipotez: Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireylerin suç eğilimi daha yüksek olacaktır. 4. Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireylerin sosyal ilişkilerindeki kalite nasıldır? Hipotez: Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireylerin sosyal ilişkileri zayıf ve manipülatif olacaktır. 5. Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireylerin psikopatolojik belirtiler açısından riski nedir? Hipotez: Karanlık Üçlü özelliklere sahip bireyler psikopatolojik belirtiler açısından daha yüksek risk altında olacaktır.","completion":"Bu araştırma, Narsisizm, Makyavelizm ve Psikopati gibi Karanlık Üçlü olarak adlandırılan kişilik özelliklerinin iş yaşamı ve toplum üzerindeki etkilerini incelemeyi hedeflemektedir.
