In the right triangles (DBC) and (ABC), since (angle ABC = alpha), it follows that the triangles cannot be congruent because if they were, (CD) would equal (AC). 3. We thus identify that (angle ABC = beta) and (angle BAC = alpha). The segment (BC) is shared between the triangles (ABC) and (DBC). Thus, (BC < AC) in triangle (ABC) and (BC > CD) in triangle (DBC). It follows that: [ CD < BC < AC ] 4. Next, to show that (CD) is the shortest edge, we note: - From triangle (ABC), (BC = 1cdotcosalpha). - From triangle (ACD), (CD < AD = AC cdot cosalpha). 5.

For the two circles to be externally tangent, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii. The distance between the centers (a, 0) and (0, 1) is given by: sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (0-1)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + 1}. Equating this distance to the sum of the radii, we get: sqrt{a^2 + 1} = 2asqrt{b}.

One equation represents a line (linear equation) and the other represents a circle (quadratic equation). 4. **Equations Involved:** Let's denote the equations as follows: - The linear equation of the line: ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) - The quadratic equation of the circle: ( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 ) 5. **Solving the System:** To solve this system of equations, we must find the points ((x, y)) that satisfy both equations. We can: - Solve the linear equation for one variable, say ( y ): ( y = -frac{Ax + C}{B} ) - Substitute this into the quadratic equation: [ (x - h)^2 + left( -frac{Ax + C}{B} - k right)^2 = r^2 ] 6. **Resulting Quadratic Equation:** After substituting ( y ) into the circle equation, we will obtain a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ): [ left( x - h right)^2 + left( -frac{Ax + C}{B} - k right)^2 = r^2 ] 7. **Quadratic Equation Analysis:** The solutions to this quadratic equation in ( x ) (i.e., the x-coordinates of the intersection points) can be analyzed by the quadratic discriminant (Delta): - If (Delta > 0), there are two distinct real solutions (corresponding to two intersection points and thus two possible triangles). - If (Delta = 0), there is exactly one real solution (corresponding to one point of tangency and thus one unique triangle). - If (Delta < 0), there are no real solutions (no intersection points, hence no triangle can be formed). 8. **Conclusion:** This process directly parallels the analysis of a quadratic equation, which can similarly have two distinct real roots, one real root (with multiplicity two), or no real roots. This shows that the analogy between the two problems is not coincidental but arises from an underlying mathematical similarity in the nature of the solutions.

Part (a): Let's restate the given information: - We have a triangle (ABC). - Right triangles (ABC_1) and (AB_1C) are constructed externally on sides (AB) and (AC), with (angle C_1 = angle B_1 = 90^circ), and (angle ABC_1 = angle ACB_1 = varphi). - (M) is the midpoint of (BC). We need to prove that: 1. (M B_{1} = M C_{1}) 2. (angle B_{1} M C_{1} = 2varphi) We proceed with the proof step by step: 1. **Calculate lengths using midpoint theorem and symmetry:** Let (P) and (Q) be the midpoints of sides (AB) and (AC), respectively. Then: - By the midpoint theorem, (MP = frac{AC}{2}) and (MQ = frac{AB}{2}). - Because of the construction, it's also true that (MC_1 = MQ) and (MB_1 = MP). 2. **Establish congruent triangles:** Now compare triangles (MC_1P) and (MB_1Q): - (MP = MQ) (equal lengths from step 1). - Because (angle C_1P = 90^circ - varphi) and (angle B_1Q = 90^circ - varphi), we have the angles consistent. - (MC_1 = MB_1) (as given by midpoint properties and congruence). Thus, triangles (MC_1P) and (MB_1Q) are congruent, which implies that (MC_1 = MB_1). 3. **Calculate the angle ( angle B_1 M C_1 ):** - Due to the symmetry and congruence established above, we analyze the involved angles: [ angle P M C_1 + angle Q M B_1 = 180^circ ] - Since each individual angle subtends identical symmetrical segments, we detail the interior angles: [ angle P M C_1 = 90^circ - varphi ] [ angle Q M B_1 = 90^circ - varphi ] [ implies angle M C_1 P + angle M B_1 Q = 180^circ - 2varphi ] [ implies angle B_1 M C_1 = 180^circ - (180^circ - 2varphi) = 2varphi ] Thus, we have shown that (M B_1 = M C_1) and (angle B_1 M C_1 = 2varphi), confirming (M, B_1, C_1) form an isosceles triangle with the required properties. (boxed{text{Part (a) complete}}) Part (b): The problem asks us to prove that the centers of externally constructed equilateral triangles on the sides of triangle (ABC) themselves form an equilateral triangle. 1. **Construct the equilateral triangles:** - Construct equilateral triangles externally on sides (AB), (BC), and (CA). Let their centers be (O_A), (O_B), and (O_C) respectively. 2. **Verify positions and distances:** - For any equilateral triangle constructed on an existing triangle, centers of the equilateral triangles will form an equilateral triangle because of uniform rotation and scaling properties by 60°. - Consider properties of medians, where each center aligns as a rotational symmetry result. 3. **Conclude with centroid coherence:** - (angle O_A O_B O_C = 60^circ) - The centroid of triangle (O_A O_B O_C) overlaps with triangle (ABC)’s centroid.

The radius r can be calculated as the average of the difference between the radii of the circumscribed and inscribed spheres divided by 2: [ r = frac{R_2 - R_1}{2} = frac{frac{sqrt{6}}{4}a - frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a}{2} ] Simplifying the above equation: [ r = frac{frac{sqrt{6}}{4}a - frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a}{2} = frac{frac{3sqrt{6}}{12}a - frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a}{2} = frac{frac{2sqrt{6}}{12}a}{2} = frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a ] 3. **Calculate the probabilities:** - First, determine the volume of each sphere: - Volume of the inscribed sphere: [ text{Volume} = frac{4}{3} pi R_1^3 = frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 ] - Volume of one smaller sphere (radius r) touching a face: [ text{Volume} = frac{4}{3} pi r^3 = frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 ] - There are four such smaller spheres, so their total volume: [ 4 cdot frac{4}{3} pi r^3 = 4 cdot frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 ] 4. **Determine the combined volume of the inscribed sphere and the four smaller spheres:** [ text{Combined Volume} = frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 + 4 cdot frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 ] Simplifying the above: [ text{Combined Volume} = left( frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 right) left(1 + 4 right) = frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 cdot 5 ] 5. **Calculate the volume of the circumscribed sphere to which P belongs:** [ text{Volume} = frac{4}{3} pi R_2^3 = frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{4}a right)^3 ] 6. **Determine the probability that point P lies within one of the five smaller spheres inside the circumscribed sphere:** [ text{Probability} = frac{text{Combined Volume of inner spheres}}{text{Volume of circumscribed sphere}} = frac{frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{12}a right)^3 cdot 5}{frac{4}{3} pi left( frac{sqrt{6}}{4}a right)^3} ] Simplify the fraction: [ text{Probability} = frac{5 cdot left(frac{sqrt{6}}{12} right)^3 }{left(frac{sqrt{6}}{4} right)^3} = frac{5 left(frac{1}{12} right)^3}{left( frac{1}{4} right)^3} = frac{5 cdot frac{1}{1728}}{frac{1}{64}} = frac{5 cdot 64}{1728} = frac{320}{1728} = frac{5}{27} approx 0.19 ] Therefore, the probability that point P lies within one of the five smaller spheres is approximately 0.19, which is closest to 0.2.

There is a tournament with ( u_{n+2} ) participants in which the winner has participated in exactly ( n ) matches (( u_k ) denotes Fibonacci numbers). # Basis of Induction: For ( n = 1 ): [ u_{3} = 2 ] The statement holds since a winner in a knock-out tournament where the participant wins at least one match implies there are at least 2 participants. # Inductive Step: Step A: Assume that it holds for some ( n = k ): - If the winner ( A ) participated in at least ( k ) matches, then there were at least ( u_{k+2} ) participants. - There exists a tournament with ( u_{k+2} ) participants in which the winner has fought ( k ) matches. Consider the next step, ( n = k+1 ). Suppose the winner ( A ) won the final match against boxer ( B ). The remaining matches can be split into two separate tournaments: 1. One tournament where the winner is ( A ) (let's call it Tournament ( A )). 2. Another tournament where the winner is ( B ) (let's call it Tournament ( B )). In Tournament ( A ), the winner ( A ) fought at least ( k ) matches, meaning this split tournament must have at least ( u_{k+1} ) participants. In Tournament ( B ), the winner ( B ) fought at least ( k-1 ) matches, meaning this split tournament must have at least ( u_{k} ) participants. Therefore, the total number of participants must be at least: [ u_{k+1} + u_{k} = u_{k+2} ] Step B: To establish the second part of the induction, we need to construct a tournament with ( u_{k+3} ) participants such that the winner of this tournament has participated in ( k+1 ) matches: 1. We already have a tournament ( T_A ) with ( u_{k+2} ) participants where the winner fought ( k ) matches. 2. We also have a tournament ( T_B ) with ( u_{k+1} ) participants where the winner fought ( k-1 ) matches. Combine these two tournaments such that the final match is between the winners of ( T_A ) and ( T_B ), and the overall winner has participated in ( (k+1) ) matches across this combined structure. Using the Fibonacci property: [ u_{k+3} = u_{k+2} + u_{k+1} ] # Conclusion: Given ( 55 ) participants, we need to find the maximum number of matches the winner could have fought.

We hypothesize that the first player, who places the 1 times 2 piece, has a winning strategy. - The first player places a 1 times 2 piece vertically in the middle of the board, overlapping the center two rows of one column, leaving: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline 1 & 1 & & hline 1 & 1 & & hline & & & hline end{array} ] This leaves the board with two 3 times 2 sections for future moves. - Any move by the second player leaves another part of the board open for the first player to place another 1 times 2 piece without running out of space. After several iterations, the second player is forced into a position where they cannot place their piece, ensuring the first player wins. 4. **Generalizing to a Larger Board:** Since 1000 is a multiple of 4, we can segment the 3 times 1000 board into 250 individual 3 times 4 boards: [ 3 times 1000 = 250 times (3 times 4) ] - Recall the strategy for each 3 times 4 board: - The first player places the 1 times 2 piece vertically in the middle section to always force the second player into having no available move eventually. 5. **Conclusion:** By applying the winning strategy for each smaller 3 times 4 section and replicating it across all 250 sections, the first player maintains control and ensures a winning move until no moves are left for the second player on the entire 3 times 1000 board. So, the first player has a winning strategy on a 3 times 1000 board by treating each 3 times 4 section independently and applying the same strategy across all sections. Thus, the first player has the winning strategy.

We take the first derivative of t with respect to x: t'(x) = 2x - 2. Setting t'(x) = 0 gives us the critical point: 2x - 2 = 0 implies x = 1. Analyzing the sign of t'(x) around the critical point, we find: - For x < 1, t'(x) < 0, which indicates that t(x) is decreasing in the interval (-infty, 1). - For x > 1, t'(x) > 0, which indicates that t(x) is increasing in the interval (1, +infty). Since y = 2^t is an increasing function of t, y will also be increasing where t is increasing and decreasing where t is decreasing. Therefore, based on the derivative analysis of t(x), we can conclude that y is: - increasing in the interval (1, +infty), and - decreasing in the interval (-infty, 1). So, the intervals of monotonicity for the function y = 2^{x^{2}-2x+4} are as follows: - The function is monotonically increasing in the interval boxed{(1, +infty)}. - The function is monotonically decreasing in the interval boxed{(-infty, 1)}."},{"prompt":"A quadrilateral has vertices P(a,b), Q(b,a), R(a, b), and S(b, a), where a and b are integers and a > b > 0.

Therefore, the area formula becomes: [ text{Area} = PQ times PS = 2|a-b||a+b| ] - Given the new area is 32, setting up the equation: [ 2|a-b||a+b| = 32 implies |a-b||a+b| = 16 ] 3. **Solving for a and b**: - With a and b as integers, and |a-b||a+b| = 16, the possible pairs for (a-b, a+b) could be (1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4) under a > b > 0.

Expanding and simplifying this equation, we find: [ a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - a^2 + b^2 - c^2 + ab = ab implies a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = ab. ] Next, by applying the Law of Cosines to angle C in triangle ABC, we can express cos C as: [ cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = frac{ab}{2ab} = frac{1}{2}. ] Given that C is in the interval (0, pi) and knowing our trigonometric identities, it follows that C = frac{pi}{3}. The second equation given is bcsin C = 3ccos A + 3acos C. We can use the sine and cosine addition formulas to rewrite the right side of the equation as 3sin(A + C) = 3sin B since A + C + B = pi in any triangle.

Thus, frac{pi}{3} < A + frac{pi}{6} < frac{2pi}{3}. This implies that frac{sqrt{3}}{2} < sin(A+frac{pi}{6}) leq 1.

The sampling methods at their disposal are simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and systematic sampling. To address the issue of heterogeneity in opinions across different age groups, the most suitable sampling method would be stratified sampling. The rationale behind choosing stratified sampling is that this method can ensure that each age group is proportionally represented in the sample, thus providing a more accurate reflection of the entire customer base's opinions. The process would include the following steps: 1. **Classification**: - The population (customers) is divided into distinct strata (age groups). 2. **Proportionate Allocation**: - Determine the sample size for each stratum proportionate to its population size. 3. **Random Selection**: - Within each stratum, carry out simple random sampling to choose customers for the survey. 4. **Data Collection and Analysis**: - Collect the survey data and analyze the results within and across the different strata. By using stratified sampling, we can avoid the pitfalls of simple random sampling, which might give too much weight to opinions from a particular age group if they happen to be oversampled.

Let A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2). By solving the system of equations: begin{cases} y = x - dfrac{p}{2} y^2 = 2px end{cases} we obtain x^2 - 3px + dfrac{p^2}{4} = 0, and hence x_1 + x_2 = 3p. Using the definition of the parabola, we have |AB| = x_1 + x_2 + p = 4p, and since |AB| = 8, we get 4p = 8, thus p = 2. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is boxed{y^2 = 4x}. (Ⅱ) Let the inclination angles of lines l_1 and l_2 be alpha and beta respectively, and let the slope of line l_1 be k, therefore k = tan alpha. Since the inclination angles of lines l_1 and l_2 are complementary, we have tan β = tan left( dfrac{pi}{2} - alpha right) = dfrac{sin left( dfrac{pi}{2} - alpha right)}{cos left( dfrac{pi}{2} - alpha right)} = dfrac{cos alpha}{sin alpha} = dfrac{1}{tan alpha}. Hence, the slope of line l_2 is dfrac{1}{k}. The equation of line CD is y - 8 = k(x - 12), or equivalently, y = k(x - 12) + 8. Substituting this into the equation of the parabola, we get k^2y^2 - 4y + 32 - 4k = 0. Thus, y_C + y_D = dfrac{4}{k}.

Step 1: Convert the parametric equations to the standard form. From the given line [ begin{cases} x = 1 + dfrac{1}{2}t y = -3 sqrt{3} + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}t end{cases}, ] we eliminate the parameter ( t ) by expressing ( y ) in terms of ( x ): [ y = sqrt{3}x - 4sqrt{3}. ] Step 2: Substitute the equation of ( y ) into the circle's equation ( x^{2} + y^{2} = 16 ) to find the intersection points: [ x^{2} + (sqrt{3}x - 4sqrt{3})^{2} = 16. ] Upon expanding and simplifying, we get the quadratic equation: [ x^{2} - 6x + 8 = 0. ] Step 3: Solve this quadratic equation for ( x ).

Now, in parallelogram ( ABCE ): [ AC^2 + BE^2 = 2 (AB^2 + BC^2) ] Given that ( AB = 1 ) cm and ( BC = sqrt{15} ) cm, we substitute these values into the equation.

The problem asks whether it is possible for the sum of the numbers in the shaded cells of a (5 times 5) grid, each containing natural numbers from 1 to 5 with all numbers in each row, column, and both main diagonals being different, to equal 20. 2. Let’s start by analyzing the total configuration of the (5 times 5) grid. Each row and column, as well as the two main diagonals, must contain each of the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) exactly once. 3. To meet the requirement that every number from (1) to (5) appears precisely once in each row and column, the sum of each row and column is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ] 4.

This placement would also put (5)s in the middle row and the middle column, causing them to appear more than once in these locations. 7. More specifically, having a (5) in each shaded cell immediately implies, since one central cell is involved, the following repeated conditions: - Presence of two (5)s in the central row. - Presence of two (5)s in the central column. - Thus violating the distinct number requirement for each row and column. 8.

To find ( angle KLM ), we use the formula for the angle between two lines with slopes ( m_1 ) and ( m_2 ): [ tan theta = left| frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} right| ] 8. Substituting the slopes of ( KL ) and ( LM ) into the formula, we get: [ tan angle KLM = left| frac{frac{cy}{cx - frac{c^2 + ac}{2}} - frac{cy - frac{y(c + a)}{2}}{cx - frac{(c + a)(c + x)}{2}}}{1 + left( frac{cy}{cx - frac{c^2 + ac}{2}} right) left( frac{cy - frac{y(c + a)}{2}}{cx - frac{(c + a)(c + x)}{2}} right)} right| ] 9.

Setting these two expressions for the new expenditure equal to each other, we get: (1.32P) * 25 = (P * C) * 1.10 Now, we can solve for C: 1.32P * 25 = 1.10P * C Divide both sides by P to cancel out the price: 1.32 * 25 = 1.10 * C Now, divide both sides by 1.10 to solve for C: (1.32 * 25) / 1.10 = C C = (33 * 25) / 11 C = (825) / 11 C = 75 So the initial monthly consumption of sugar was boxed{75} kg."},{"prompt":"Prove that (2^{n} > (1x)^{n} + (1+x)^{n}) for any integer (n geq 2) and ( |x| < 1 ).","completion":"Given the problem statement: text{Prove that } 2^n > (1-x)^n + (1+x)^n text{ for integer } n geq 2 text{ and } |x| < 1. 1. **Express 2^n using the Binomial Theorem:** Using the Binomial Theorem: [ 2^n = (1-x + 1+x)^n = (2)^n ] Since (1-x) + (1+x) = 2, we can rewrite: [ 2^n = ((1-x) + (1+x))^n ] 2. **Expand (1-x)^n and (1+x)^n using the Binomial Theorem:** The Binomial expansion for (1-x)^n is: [ (1-x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-x)^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k x^k ] Similarly, the Binomial expansion for (1+x)^n is: [ (1+x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k ] 3. **Combine the expansions of (1-x)^n and (1+x)^n:** Adding the two series together we get: [ (1-x)^n + (1+x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k x^k + sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k ] This simplifies to: [ (1-x)^n + (1+x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k ( (-1)^k + 1 ) ] 4. **Note the properties of the terms:** Notice that (-1)^k + 1 is: [ begin{cases} 2 & text{if } k text{ is even} 0 & text{if } k text{ is odd} end{cases} ] Thus, only the even-indexed terms in the sum survive: [ (1-x)^n + (1+x)^n = sum_{substack{ k=0 k text{ even} }}^{n} 2 binom{n}{k} x^k ] So we get: [ (1-x)^n + (1+x)^n = 2 sum_{substack{ k=0 k text{ even} }}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k ] 5. **Compare with 2^n:** Since |x| < 1, the sum sum_{substack{ k=0 k text{ even} }}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k < sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k = (1+x)^n text{ with } |x| < 1.

We are given that the total volume of the mixture is 100 litres and that M = 36 litres. Therefore, W = 100 - M = 100 - 36 = 64 litres. When 'x' litres of the mixture is removed, the ratio of milk to water in the removed mixture is the same as in the original mixture, which is M:W or 36:64. Therefore, the amount of milk removed is (36/100)x and the amount of water removed is (64/100)x. After the removal and replacement with x litres of water, the new volume of milk is M - (36/100)x and the new volume of water is W - (64/100)x + x. This process is repeated once more, so again (36/100)x of milk is removed and (64/100)x of water is removed, and x litres of water is added.

By definition, each circle (C_i) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the side of the triangle formed by the vertices it passes through. For example, (C_1) passes through (A) and (B), thus the center (O_1) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (AB). 2. **Co-linearity of Centers Due to Tangency:** Since (C_1) and (C_2) touch each other and share the point (B): [ O_1, B, text{ and } O_2 text{ must be collinear}.] 3. **Defining Angles Around the Triangle:** Consider (M) to be the midpoint of (AB).

We construct a perpendicular from ( I ) to ( DI_a ) which intersects the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) at ( A' ). Similar definitions apply for points ( B' ) and ( C' ). Step 2: Proving Auxiliary Lemma **Lemma:** Consider (triangle ABC), with incenter ( I ) and ( angle A )'s excenter ( J ). Let ( F ) be the intersection of the external angle bisector of ( angle BAC ) and line ( BC ). Draw a perpendicular from ( I ) to ( JF ), meeting ( JF ) at ( G ).

Thus: [ angle (AB, PM) = angle (PM, ell_P) ] 4. **Angle Equivalences:** With the previous step, observe the angles: [ angle PRT = angle MPX = angle PFX = angle PRS ] 5. **Arc Midpoints and Parallelism:** Since ( M ) is the midpoint of the arc ( AB ) on ( omega ), it follows: [ Q text{ is the midpoint of the arc } TQS text{ on } Omega ] Therefore, ( ST parallel ell_Q ). 6. **Homothety:** The triangles ( RST ) and ( XYZ ) have corresponding sides that are parallel, so there exists a homothety ( h ) mapping ( RST ) to ( XYZ ). 7. **Homothety Center:** Let ( D ) be the second point of intersection of ( XR ) and ( Omega ). We claim that ( D ) is the center of the homothety ( h ). Since ( D ) is on ( Omega ), this implies that the circumcircles of triangles ( RST ) and ( XYZ ) are tangent. 8. **Proof of Claim:** It's sufficient to demonstrate ( D in SY ). From: [ angle PFX = angle XPF Rightarrow XF^2 = XP^2 = XA cdot XB = XD cdot XR ] This implies: [ frac{XF}{XD} = frac{XR}{XF} ] Hence, the triangles ( XDF ) and ( XFR ) are similar: [ angle DFX = angle XRF = angle DRQ = angle DQY ] Thus, ( D, Y, Q ) and ( F ) are concyclic. 9. **Collinearity:** This leads us to: [ angle YDQ = angle YFQ = angle SRQ = 180^circ - angle SDQ ] Therefore, points ( Y, D, ) and ( S ) are collinear, with ( D ) lying between ( S ) and ( Y ). 10. **Conclusion:** This proves that ( D ) is indeed the center of the homothety ( h ), and the circumcircle of ( XYZ ) is tangent to ( Omega ).

Find, with proof, the maximum possible length of ( u ).","completion":"1. **Understand the Initial Setup:** - We start with six specific vectors on the board: [ (1,0,0), quad (-1,0,0), quad (0,1,0), quad (0,-1,0), quad (0,0,1), quad (0,0,-1). ] 2. **Performing the Operations:** - The operation involves choosing two vectors ( v ) and ( w ), then replacing them with two new vectors: [ frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(v + w) quad text{and} quad frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(v - w). ] 3. **Constructing a Specific Example:** - Consider the pairs ((1,0,0)) and ((-1,0,0)): [ left(1, 0, 0right), left(-1, 0, 0right) rightarrow left( frac{(1,0,0)+(-1,0,0)}{sqrt{2}}, frac{(1,0,0)-(-1,0,0)}{sqrt{2}} right)=left(0,frac{2}{sqrt{2}},0right)=left(0,sqrt{2},0right). ] - So after this move, we replace ((1,0,0)) and ((-1,0,0)) with ((0, sqrt{2}, 0)). 4. **Repeating with Others for Construction:** - Similarly for the pairs ((0, 1, 0)) and ((0, -1, 0)): [ left(0, 1, 0right), left(0, -1, 0right) rightarrow left(0,0,0right), left(0, sqrt{2}, 0right). ] - And for ((0, 0, 1)) and ((0, 0, -1)): [ left(0, 0, 1right), left(0, 0, -1right) rightarrow left(0,0,sqrt{2}right), left(0,0,0right). ] - Then, adding these intermediate results, you can achieve (u=(2, 2, 2)). 5. **Calculating and Bounding (S):** - Define ( n = (x, y, z) ) as any unit vector. Consider ( S=sum_i (n cdot v_i)^2 ). - Show that ( S ) is invariant: [ left( n cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(v+w) right)^2 + left( n cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(v-w) right)^2 = left( frac{n cdot v + n cdot w}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 + left( frac{n cdot v - n cdot w}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 ] [ = frac{(n cdot v)^2 + 2(n cdot v)(n cdot w) + (n cdot w)^2}{2} + frac{(n cdot v)^2 - 2(n cdot v)(n cdot w) + (n cdot w)^2}{2} ] [ = frac{(n cdot v)^2 + (n cdot w)^2 + (n cdot v)^2 + (n cdot w)^2}{2} = (n cdot v)^2 + (n cdot w)^2. ] 6. **Initial Sum of Squares and Invariance:** - Initially: [ S = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 = 2(underbrace{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}_{=1}) = 2. ] - Therefore, ( S=2 ) is invariant through all vector transformations. 7. **Use of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** - Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: [ n cdot u = sum n cdot v_i leq sqrt{sum (n cdot v_i)^2} sqrt{6} = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}. ] - Since ( n ) is arbitrary: [ |u| leq 2 sqrt{3}. ] 8. **Conclusion:** - The maximum possible length of ( u ) is [ boxed{2 sqrt{3}}. ]"},{"prompt":"run at a constant pace, and it takes me 30 minutes to run to the grocery store from my house.

We know the total weight he is moving is 525 kg, which includes his own weight and the weight of the vest.

First, consider the polynomial ( f(x) ). Since ( f ) has positive integer coefficients, ( f(x) ) is strictly increasing for ( x geq 1 ). This means that for any ( x geq 1 ), ( f(x) geq f(1) ). 3. We need to show that ( f(n) mid f(f(n) + 1) ) if and only if ( n = 1 ). 4. Notice that ( f(n) + 1 - 1 = f(n) ). Therefore, we can write: [ f(n) mid f(f(n) + 1) - f(1) ] This follows from the fact that if ( a mid b ) and ( a mid c ), then ( a mid (b - c) ). 5. Since ( f(n) mid f(f(n) + 1) - f(1) ), it implies that: [ f(n) mid f(f(n) + 1) ] if and only if: [ f(n) mid f(1) ] 6. Now, consider the case when ( n = 1 ): [ f(1) mid f(f(1) + 1) ] Since ( f ) has positive integer coefficients, ( f(1) ) is a positive integer. Therefore, ( f(1) ) divides ( f(f(1) + 1) ). 7.

What is the percentage increase in the prices of goods?","completion":"Let's denote the percentage increase in the prices of goods as P%. The original price of an orange is 40, and the original price of a mango is 50. After the increase, the new price of an orange is 40 + (40 * P/100) = 40 * (1 + P/100). Similarly, the new price of a mango is 50 + (50 * P/100) = 50 * (1 + P/100). We know that buying ten oranges and ten mangoes at the new prices costs 1035 in total. So we can write the equation: 10 * (40 * (1 + P/100)) + 10 * (50 * (1 + P/100)) = 1035 Now, let's simplify the equation: 10 * 40 * (1 + P/100) + 10 * 50 * (1 + P/100) = 1035 400 * (1 + P/100) + 500 * (1 + P/100) = 1035 Combining the terms: (400 + 500) * (1 + P/100) = 1035 900 * (1 + P/100) = 1035 Now, divide both sides by 900 to solve for (1 + P/100): (1 + P/100) = 1035 / 900 Calculate the right side: (1 + P/100) = 1.15 Now, subtract 1 from both sides to solve for P/100: P/100 = 1.15 - 1 P/100 = 0.15 Finally, multiply both sides by 100 to find P: P = 0.15 * 100 P = 15 The percentage increase in the prices of goods is boxed{15%} ."},{"prompt":"the Huan Taihu Middle and Long Distance Race held this October, the number of participants reached 21,780.

Part 1: **Problem Restatement**: A group of 8th-grade students stand in a line, each with a shorter 7th-grade student standing in front of them. We need to prove that when both the 8th-grade and the 7th-grade students are rearranged in order of height, each 8th-grade student remains taller than the 7th-grade student who originally stood in front of them. 1. **Preparation**: - Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) be the 8th-grade students. - Let ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n ) be the 7th-grade students. - Given the condition: ( A_i ) stands behind ( B_i ) and ( A_i ) is taller than ( B_i ) for all ( i ). 2. **Rearrangement**: - Arrange the 8th-grade students ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) in non-decreasing order of height: ( A_{(1)}, A_{(2)}, ldots, A_{(n)} ). - Arrange the 7th-grade students ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n ) in non-decreasing order of height: ( B_{(1)}, B_{(2)}, ldots, B_{(n)} ). 3. **Proof**: - We need to show that ( A_{(i)} ) is taller than ( B_{(i)} ) for each ( i ).

To show this, consider two adjacent soldiers in a row, ( A[i][j] ) and ( A[i][j+1] ). - **Initially**: By the problem statement, we have ( A[i][j] leq A[i][j+1] ). - **After Sorting**: Each column is sorted, but we have to ensure that the row sorting property still holds. - Suppose there are two elements ( x = A[i][j] ) and ( y = A[i][j+1] ) taken from row ( i ): By the initial setup and properties of the row sorting: - ( A[1][j] leq A[2][j] leq cdots leq A[i][j] ) - ( A[1][j+1] leq A[2][j+1] leq cdots leq A[i][j+1] ) Considering ( x ) and ( y ) after the column sort, we need to show ( A[i-1][j+1] leq A[i][j+1] ). As the array elements ( A[i][j] ) and ( A[i][j+1] ) maintain their row order, [ A[i][j] leq A[i][j+1] ] - Since height orders are transitive and each soldier in previous row remains shorter or equal given initial rows sorting, the current soldier in row ( i ) maintains the same relative order when viewed row-wise post sorting columns. 4. **Conclusion**: Each row remains sorted in increasing order when columns are individually sorted.

We need to prove that ( a_n ) is an integer for all ( n geq 0 ). 1. We start by examining the recurrence relationships: [ a_{n+1} - x a_{n} = y^{n+1} ] [ a_{n+1} - y a_{n} = x^{n+1} ] In particular, for ( n+2 ), we have: [ a_{n+2} - x a_{n+1} = y^{n+2} = y cdot y^{n+1} = y(a_{n+1} - x a_{n}) ] Rearranging terms, we obtain: [ a_{n+2} = (x+y) a_{n+1} - x y a_{n} ] 2. Let us define ( s = x + y ) and ( t = x y ). Then the recurrence relation simplifies to: [ a_{n+2} = s a_{n+1} - t a_{n} ] Given the integral values ( a_{m}, a_{m+1}, a_{m+2}, a_{m+3} ), we can set up the following system of linear equations: [ a_{m+2} = s a_{m+1} - t a_{m} ] [ a_{m+3} = s a_{m+2} - t a_{m+1} ] We need to solve these equations to find ( s ) and ( t ). If the determinant ( a_{m+1}^2 - a_{m+2} a_{m} ) is nonzero, these equations have a unique solution. 3. Compute the determinant ( a_{m+1}^2 - a_{m+2} a_{m} ): [ begin{aligned} a_{m+1}^2 - a_{m+2} a_{m} &= a_{m+1} (a_{m+1} - x a_{m}) - a_{m} (a_{m+2} - x a_{m+1}) &= a_{m+1} y^{m+1} - a_{m} y^{m+2} &= y^{m+1} (a_{m+1} - y a_{m}) &= x^{m+1} y^{m+1} = t^{m+1} end{aligned} ] So we need to consider two cases: 4. **Case 1: ( t=0 )** If ( t = xy = 0 ), without loss of generality, let's assume ( y = 0 ). Then the sequence reduces to: [ a_{n} = x^n ] By the following lemma: **Lemma 1:** If ( x ) is a real number and ( n ) is a nonnegative integer such that ( x^n ) and ( x^{n+1} ) are integers, then ( x ) is an integer. **Proof:** [ x = frac{x^{n+1}}{x^n} ] is rational (if ( x = 0 ), the conclusion is immediate). Write ( x = frac{p}{q} ) in lowest terms with ( q > 0 ). Then ( x^n = frac{p^n}{q^n} ) is also in lowest terms, implying ( q = 1 ). Therefore, ( x ) is an integer. 5. **Case 2: ( t neq 0 )** If ( t neq 0 ), then ( t^{m+1} ) is an integer, so ( t ) must be an integer by Lemma 1. Now, since ( s ) defined as ( x + y ), let's verify ( s ) is also an integer. If ( s = frac{u}{v} ), with ( v > 1 ), every term ( a_n ) must be rational and most specifically: [ a_n = frac{u_n}{v_n} ] in lowest terms. Assuming ( v_n = v^n ) for ( n geq 0 ) can be proven via strong induction using the recurrence relation: [ frac{u_{n+2}}{v_{n+2}} = frac{u u_{n+1} - t v^2 u_{n}}{v^{n+2}} ] This indicates ( a_n notin mathbb{Z} ) for ( n geq 1 ), leading to a contradiction. Hence ( s ) must also be an integer. Since ( x + y = s ) and ( xy = t ) are integers, both ( x ) and ( y ) must be algebraic integers.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the time given is in seconds and the length we want to find is in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s So, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Now, we know the time taken to cross each other is 11.879049676025918 seconds. The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the second train as L2.

The hem is 300 cm long. The waist is a third of the length of the hem, so it is 300 cm / 3 = 100 cm long. The neckline has 5 ruffles, each using 20 cm of lace, so the total lace for the neckline is 5 ruffles * 20 cm/ruffle = 100 cm. Now, let's add up the lace used for the hem, waist, and neckline: Hem lace + Waist lace + Neckline lace = 300 cm + 100 cm + 100 cm = 500 cm. Since Carolyn spends 36 on lace and the lace costs 6/m, we can calculate the total length of lace she bought: 36 / (6/m) = 6 meters of lace. We need to convert meters to centimeters to match the other measurements: 6 meters * 100 cm/meter = 600 cm of lace. Now, let's subtract the lace used for the hem, waist, and neckline from the total length of lace to find out how much lace is left for the cuffs: Total lace - (Hem lace + Waist lace + Neckline lace) = 600 cm - 500 cm = 100 cm of lace left for the cuffs.

General Case for ((a + b)^n): From the specific cases of (a+b)^2 and (a+b)^3, we can generalize for ((a+b)^n). 1.

Let's denote the internal bisectors of angles in the quadrilateral ABCD as follows: - A's internal bisector is AP, - B's internal bisector is BQ, - C's internal bisector is CR, - D's internal bisector is DS. Let the angles of the quadrilateral A, B, C, and D be alpha, beta, gamma, and varphi respectively. 2. Consider the intersection points of these bisectors: - AP intersects DS at S, - BQ intersects CR at Q. 3. We need to prove that the points P, S, R, and Q lie on a single circle, i.e., they are concyclic. For this, we need to demonstrate that the sum of the opposite angles formed by these intersecting bisectors equals 180^circ. 4. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, in any quadrilateral: - The angle formed by the bisector of angle A and D is given by: [ angle AS D = 180^circ - frac{alpha}{2} - frac{varphi}{2} ] - The angle formed by the bisector of angle B and C is given by: [ angle BQC = 180^circ - frac{beta}{2} - frac{gamma}{2} ] 5.

Each cell ((i, j)) represents a game played between the girl with number ( j ) and the boy with number ( i ). We want to prove that if every girl plays exactly one game with each boy and ( n ) is odd, then the girl and boy in the last game have odd numbers. 2. **Representation:** We represent the tournament in the form of a table where both columns and rows are numbered from 1 to ( n ). A game between the girl with number ( j ) and the boy with number ( i ) is represented by the cell ((i, j)). 3. **Defining Moves:** Let's place a marker in the first cell ((1, 1)). If the girl wins, the marker moves up, and if the boy wins, the marker moves to the right. If it reaches the end of a row or column, the marker wraps around to the beginning of that row or column. 4. **Tracking Moves and Tournament Conditions:** The problem translates to showing that the marker visits each cell exactly once and returns to an odd-numbered cell. We color the cells diagonally to track the movements, noting that: - Moving up corresponds to an increase by 1 mod ( n ). - Moving right corresponds to the same. 5. **Cycle Analysis and Modulo Calculations:** Since (n) is odd, the marker will visit all cells at least once as it circulates through the table. By the end of (n^2) games, the marker returns to the main diagonal. 6. **Cycle Symmetry and Centered Moves:** We analyze the cycle of moves. Every two cells symmetrically positioned around the center of the cycle sum to ( k ). Therefore, the value of the final cell is influenced by the symmetric property of the cycle. 7. **Circular Walkthrough and Symmetry Finalization:** Without loss of generality, let's further assume the marker always hits the main diagonal cells. Thus, the final state after (n^2) games ensures we have traversed every diagonal exactly once. This confirms that the sum of the coordinates remains odd due to number parity preservation. 8. **Conclusion:** After ensuring thorough symmetric moves through column and row tracking, we can conclude that: [ boxed{n text{ odd guarantees both girl and boy numbers are odd.}} ] Hence, if (n) is odd, then in the last game both players (girl and boy) have odd numbers."},{"prompt":"For the power function f(x) = x^{frac{4}{5}}, if 0 < x_1 < x_2, then the relationship between f(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) and frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} is ( ) A: f(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) > frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} B: f(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) < frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} C: f(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) = frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} D: Cannot be determined","completion":"Since the power function f(x) = x^{frac{4}{5}} is increasing on (0, +infty) and its graph is convex, When 0 < x_1 < x_2, we should have f(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) > frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2}.

As ( n ) increases, ( A_n ) must also increase without bound because ( a^n + 1 ) grows exponentially. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle**: By the pigeonhole principle, among any ( k+1 ) successive terms of the form ( a^i + 1 ), there must be at least two terms, say ( a^t + 1 ) and ( a^j + 1 ), such that the maximum exponent ( A ) corresponds to the same prime ( q_l ). 5. **Difference of Terms**: Consider the difference ( a^t + 1 - (a^j + 1) = a^t - a^j ). Since ( q_l ) divides both ( a^t + 1 ) and ( a^j + 1 ), it must also divide ( a^t - a^j ). 6. **Divisibility Condition**: Since ( (a, q_l) = 1 ), it follows that ( q_l ) divides ( a^{t-j} - 1 ). However, ( t - j ) is at most ( k ), and ( q_l^A ) approaches infinity, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the assumption that there are only finitely many prime divisors is false. Hence, there must be infinitely many primes dividing some term of the sequence ( (a^n + 1)_{n geq 1} ). # Part (ii) 1. **Prime Divisors of ( a^{2i+1} - 1 )**: Consider the sequence ( (a^{2i+1} - 1)_{i geq 0} ). Let ( h_i ) be a prime divisor of ( a^{2i+1} - 1 ). 2. **Order of ( a ) Modulo ( h_i )**: The order of ( a ) modulo ( h_i ), denoted ( text{ord}_a(h_i) ), must be an odd number because ( a^{2i+1} equiv 1 pmod{h_i} ). 3. **Non-Divisibility by ( h_i )**: Since ( text{ord}_a(h_i) ) is odd, there is no ( n ) such that ( a^n + 1 equiv 0 pmod{h_i} ). This means ( h_i ) does not divide any term of the sequence ( (a^n + 1)_{n geq 1} ). 4. **Infinitely Many Primes**: Similar to the argument in part (i), the sequence ( (a^{2i+1} - 1)_{i geq 0} ) must have infinitely many prime divisors. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there exist infinitely many primes ( h_i ) such that none of them divide any term of the sequence ( (a^n + 1)_{n geq 1} ).

For example, the number 5 in decimal is represented as (101) in binary. 2. **Powers of 2 as Weights:** The essence of the solution is that any number can be weighed by combining different powers of 2. Thus, by using weights that are each a power of 2, we can achieve any desired weight by summing the appropriate weights. 3. **Range of Weights:** To determine the minimum number of weights, note that: - The smallest weight is (2^0 = 1). - The largest weight for the range 1 to 100 needs to be determined. The sum of powers of 2 from (2^0) to (2^6) is: [ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127 ] This sum is sufficient to cover the number 100, as 127 is larger than 100. 4. **Minimum Weights Calculation:** - To mathematically confirm this, consider (2^n - 1) where (n) is the number of weights. - For (n = 6): [ 2^6 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63 ] is not sufficient, as it only allows us to measure weights up to 63 grams. - For (n = 7): [ 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127 ] which is sufficient to cover weights up to 127 grams. 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, the minimum number of weights required to independently weigh any number from 1 to 100 grams using only single pan balance weights is 7.

In this case (c = 1) and (a = 1), thus (x_1 x_2 = 1). 3. **Polynomial Division**: - We need to show that there exist integers (a_m) and (b_m) such that the polynomial (x^{2012} - a_m x - b_m) is divisible by (x^2 - mx + 1). - Perform polynomial long division of (x^{2012}) by (x^2 - mx + 1): [ x^{2012} = (x^2 - mx + 1)Q(x) + R_m(x), ] where (Q(x)) is the quotient and (R_m(x)) is the remainder.

This yields the equation: [ x^{2012} = (x^2 - mx + 1)Q(x) + a_m x + b_m. ] 5. **Relationship Between Solutions**: - For any fixed (m > 2), if (x_1) and (x_2) are roots of (x^2 - mx + 1 = 0), they are also roots of (x^{2012} - a_m x - b_m = 0). - Thus, the equation (x^{2012} = a_m x + b_m) has the two distinct real numbers (x_1) and (x_2) as solutions, and their product (x_1 x_2 = 1). 6. **Infinitely Many Pairs ((a_m, b_m))**: - As (m) varies over all integers greater than 2, the pairs ((a_m, b_m)) are distinct. - For (m_1 neq m_2), the roots of (x^2 - m_1 x + 1) are distinct from the roots of (x^2 - m_2 x + 1). If they shared a common root, it would be a root of ((m_2 - m_1)x), and hence zero, which cannot be a root of any (x^2 - mx + 1). 7. **Limitation on Roots**: - The polynomial (x^{2012} - a x - b) can have at most 2012 distinct roots because the highest degree term limits the number of possible distinct solutions. - Given (x^{2012} - a x - b) could be divisible by (x^2 - mx + 1) for at most 1006 different (m) values, ensuring that each pairing repeats at most 1006 times. 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, there must be infinitely many distinct pairs ((a_m, b_m)) fulfilling the conditions of the problem.

But by Lemma 1, we know that there exist at most 5 distinct reals ( x ) satisfying ( g(x) = -x - a ) (at most two on each side, and possibly ( x = a ) itself). This means that all but at most 10 points ( x in (-t - b, -t - a) ) satisfy ( g(x) = t ). Therefore, there exist ( x_1, x_2 ) arbitrarily close to ( -t - b, -t - a ) respectively, such that ( -t - b < x_1 < x_2 < -t - a ) and ( g(x_1) = g(x_2) = t ). Using the statement in the end of the last paragraph on the pair ( (x_1, x_2) ) instead of ( (a, b) ), we conclude that all but at most 10 points ( x in (-t - (-t - a), -t - (-t - b)) = (a, b) ) satisfy ( g(x) = t ). Finally, these \\"bad\\" points actually cannot exist: suppose ( x in (a, b) ) and ( g(x) neq t ), then ( g(x) + x in {-a, -b} ). Since ( a < b ), there exist ( c, d ) distinct from ( a, b ) such that ( c < x < d ) and ( g(c) = g(d) = t ), so ( g(x) + x in {-c, -d} ) as well, which is impossible. Therefore, ( g ) is constant on ( [a, b] ). (blacksquare) 5. **Lemma 3**: Suppose there exists ( a < b ) such that ( g(a) < g(b) ). Then ( g ) is constant on ( [a, b) ). **Proof of Lemma 3**: First, since ( g(a) ne g(b) ), we have [ (g(a) + a + b)(g(b) + a + b) leq 0 ] so ( g(a) + a + b leq 0 leq g(b) + a + b ). Now, suppose ( x in (a, b) ) is a real number such that ( g(x) > g(a) ), then we also have ( g(a) + a + x leq 0 leq g(x) + a + x ). Because ( x in (a, b) ), we know that ( x > a ge -g(b) - b ) and ( x < b le -g(a) - a ), which means that ( g(b) + b + x > 0 ) and ( g(x) + b + x > g(x) + a + x ge 0 ). This implies that ( g(x) = g(b) ) for some ( a < x < b ). By the proof of Lemma 2, we see that ( g(y) = g(b) ) for all ( y in (-g(b) - b, -g(x) - x) ). But ( -g(b) - b le a ), so we conclude (using Lemma 2) that ( -g(b) - b = a ) and ( g ) is constant on ( (a, b] ). But if we replace ( b ) with any real ( b' in (a, b) ), we also conclude that ( g(b') = -a - b' neq g(b) ), contradiction. Therefore, ( g(x) le g(a) ), so ( g ) is nonincreasing on ( [a, b) ). For any ( x in (a, b) ), if ( g(x) neq g(a) ), then ( g(x) + a + x le 0 le g(a) + a + x ). But ( g(a) + a + b le 0 le g(b) + a + b ), so [ 0 le g(a) + a + x < g(a) + a + b le 0 ] contradiction. Thus, ( g(x) = g(a) ) for all ( x in [a, b) ). (blacksquare) 6. **Conclusion**: Suppose there exists ( a < b ) such that ( g(a) < g(b) ), then ( g ) is constant on ( [a, b) ) by Lemma 3. By Lemma 2, we see that ( g(y) = g(a) ) for all ( y in (-g(x) - x, -g(a) - a) ), and since ( -g(a) - a ge b ), we conclude that ( g(a) = -a - b ). But this is also impossible: if we replace ( a ) with any real ( a' in (a, b) ), we also have that ( g(a') = -a' - b neq g(a) ), contradiction. Therefore, ( g ) is nonincreasing as desired."},{"prompt":"A and B are both decimals less than 1. The result of the expression A times B + 0.1 is: A. Greater than 1 B. Less than 1 C. Equal to 1 D.

Since ( a le n-1 ), we have: [ a! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots a ] Since ( a le n-1 ), ( a! ) is a product of all integers from 1 to ( a ).

Without loss of generality, suppose the angles ( angle A_1, angle A_2, angle A_3 ) are 120^circ each. 3. **Understanding the Arcs Corresponding to 120° Angles:** The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Therefore, if ( angle A_1, angle A_2, angle A_3 ) are 120^circ each, then these three vertices subtend arcs of 240^circ on the circle. This means the points A_1, A_2, A_3 are located such that the corresponding arcs each measure 240^circ. 4. **Placement of Remaining Vertices:** Since the polygon is inscribed in a circle, the sum of all central angles subtended by its sides is 360^circ. The three 120^circ angles already account for 3 times 120^circ = 360^circ, implying that the remaining four vertices subtend the remaining 360^circ - 360^circ = 0^circ around the circle. 5. **Equal Side Lengths:** Now, let's consider the non-120^circ angles. Since we have already accounted for 360^circ of the circle's circumference with the 120^circ angles, the remaining angles must be such that the sum still equals 360^circ because they lie on the arc between 120^circ intervals. 6. **Edges with Equal Length Analysis:** Given that the sides of the polygon are chords of equal arcs of 360^circ / 7, there must be segments around the circle creating congruent triangles. This implies symmetry around those specific chords, as they reach from a central angle to equally spaced vertices. Moreover, since the obtuse angles (120°) sit opposite those which must close this symmetry, we posit: - Two pairs A_1A_2 and A_6A_7 must suite a congruence test under equal subtending segments. We now assert our geometry validates this, concluding (A_2A_3 = A_3A_4). 7. **Conclusion:** Hence, there must indeed be at least two sides of the polygon with equal lengths.

We need to apply Snell's Law again: [ 1.6 sin theta_2 = 1 sin theta_1' ] We know ( theta_2 approx 33.75^circ ) from previous calculations, so [ 1.6 cdot sin 33.75^circ ≈ 1 cdot sin theta_1' ] Substituting: [ sin theta_1' ≈ sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] 5. **Calculating the Angle of Deviation:** The total angle of deviation from the initial ray's path (angle (theta_1 = 60^circ)) due to the internal reflection and refraction at the surfaces: [ theta_{text{deviation}} = 180^circ - 2 theta_1 ] Substituting the given values: [ theta_{text{deviation}} = 180^circ - 2 times 60^circ ] Simplifying, [ theta_{text{deviation}} = 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{60^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Two nonparallel lines cannot have their parallel projection as ( ) A: Two parallel lines B: A point and a line C: Two intersecting lines D: Two po","completion":"**Solution**: Given that there are two non-parallel lines, these two lines are either skew or intersecting.

Tuesday: 10% boost in sales + 40 more dinners than Monday 10% of 50 dinners is 5 dinners, so the boost in sales is 5 dinners. Therefore, the restaurant sells 50 + 5 + 40 = 95 dinners on Tuesday. Wednesday: 15% decrease in sales from Tuesday, then half of that amount 15% of 95 dinners is 0.15 * 95 = 14.25 dinners. The decrease in sales would be 95 - 14.25 = 80.75 dinners, but since the restaurant sells half of Tuesday's amount, it sells 95 / 2 = 47.5 dinners on Wednesday. Since we can't sell half a dinner, we'll round this to 47 or 48 dinners depending on the restaurant's policy. Let's assume they round down to whole dinners, so 47 dinners are sold on Wednesday. Thursday: 20% increase in sales compared to Wednesday 20% of 47 dinners is 0.20 * 47 = 9.4 dinners. The increase in sales would be 47 + 9.4 = 56.4 dinners. Again, we'll round to the nearest whole number, so the restaurant sells 56 dinners on Thursday. Now, let's add up the dinners sold over the four days: Monday: 50 dinners Tuesday: 95 dinners Wednesday: 47 dinners Thursday: 56 dinners Total dinners sold = 50 + 95 + 47 + 56 = 248 dinners Therefore, the restaurant sold a total of boxed{248} dinners over the four days."},{"prompt":"A cell phone plan costs 25 dollars each month, includes 20 text messages, with each additional text costing 10 cents, and includes 20 hours of talk time with each extra hour costing 15 cents per minute.

The theme of this conference was strengthening the core, focusing on quality, aiming to cultivate and strengthen China's integrated circuit industry, solidify the industrial foundation, and create a good industrial ecosystem. A chip research and development unit spent a percentage y of its total research and development costs on the A chip, as shown in the table. It is known that overline{y}=40%. Two regression lines were obtained using p=30% and p=40%, with equations y=hat{{b}}_{1}x+hat{{a}}_{1} and y=hat{{b}}_{2}x+hat{{a}}_{2}, corresponding to correlation coefficients r_{1} and r_{2}, and variances {s}_{1}^{2} and {s}_{2}^{2} for the percentage y.

Let's break down the solution step by step, following the information provided and the rules for rewriting the solution. # Step 1: Understanding the Impact of p on Correlation Coefficients (r_1 and r_2) - When p=30%, we substitute q=60% into the table. This results in a perfect linear positive correlation between x and y, meaning all the points lie exactly on a straight line. Thus, r_1=1. - When p changes, the exact value of r_2 is not given, but it is implied that r_2 would be less than 1 because the data points would not align as perfectly as in the case of p=30%. Therefore, we conclude that r_1 = 1 > r_2. This supports option A. # Step 2: Analyzing the Variance (s_1^2 and s_2^2) - Variance (s^2) measures the spread of the data points around the mean. A lower variance indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, suggesting more stability. - When p=30%, the spread of y values is greater compared to when p=40%, which implies s_1^2 > s_2^2. This supports option B. # Step 3: Comparing the Slopes of the Regression Lines (hat{b}_1 and hat{b}_2) - The slope of the regression line, hat{b}, is calculated using the formula given. We need to compare hat{b}_1 and hat{b}_2 for p=30% and p=40%, respectively. - For p=30%, the sum sum_{i=1}^5x_iy_i=700%. - For p=40%, the sum sum_{i=1}^5x_iy_i=670%. - Since the numerator for hat{b}_1 is greater than that for hat{b}_2, and the denominator remains constant (as it only depends on x), we conclude hat{b}_1 > hat{b}_2. This supports option C. # Step 4: Determining the Intercept of the Regression Lines (hat{a}_1 and hat{a}_2) - The intercept, hat{a}, is calculated using overline{y}-hat{b}overline{x}. Since hat{b}_1 > hat{b}_2 and overline{y} and overline{x} are constants, it implies that hat{a}_1 < hat{a}_2. This means option D is incorrect. # Conclusion Based on the analysis, the correct options are A, B, and C.

If c_{n}=n (nin N^{*}), then a valid general term formula for {b_{n}} is b_{n}=n, because when b_{n}=n, Asubseteq B, therefore Acup B=B={1,2,3,ldots,n,ldots}, and in this case, c_{n}=n. Thus, the general term formula for {b_{n}} is boxed{b_{n}=n}. Part 2: Given b_{n}=sqrt{2}n, and {d_n}={3^n}+{(-1)^n}{({frac{{{b_n}}}{n}})^{2n}}cdotlambda, (nin N^{*}), since the sequence {d_{n}} is strictly monotonically increasing for nin N^{*}, we have d_{n+1}-d_{n} > 0. For odd n, we find that lambda > -(frac{3}{2})^{n-1}, and since -(frac{3}{2})^{n-1} is monotonically decreasing, when n=1, -(frac{3}{2})^{n-1} is maximized at -1, leading to lambda > -1. For even n, we find that lambda < (frac{3}{2})^{n-1}, and since (frac{3}{2})^{n-1} is monotonically increasing, when n=2, (frac{3}{2})^{n-1} is minimized at frac{3}{2}, leading to lambda < frac{3}{2}. Therefore, the range of lambda is boxed{lambda in (-1, frac{3}{2})}. Part 3: Given a_{1}=c_{1}=1, a_{4}=c_{9}=8, a_{2}=2, a_{3}=4, the first 5 terms of {b_{n}} must be within (1,8), and the common difference of {b_{n}} is greater than 0. - If c_{2}=a_{2}=2, this leads to a contradiction as {c}_{4}=8=c_{9}, which is not valid. - If c_{3}=a_{2}=2, then b_{1}=c_{2}, and since the first 5 terms of {c_{n}} form a geometric sequence, we get {b}_{1}^{2}=c_{1}c_{3}=2, so b_{1}=sqrt{2}.

The center of circle M is at the point (-cos q, sin q), and the radius r is 1, according to the equation of the circle. Next, we find the distance d from the center of the circle to the line l. The distance from a point (h, j) to the line y=kx is given by: d = frac{|j - kh|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}. For our circle's center (-cos q, sin q), we get: d = frac{|sin q - k(-cos q)|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = frac{|sin q + kcos q|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}. Using the sine of the sum formula, we rewrite the numerator as: |sin q + kcos q| = |sin(q + arctan k)|. Since the sine function is bounded (by -1 and 1), and considering that the distance from the center to the tangent line of a circle is equal to the radius, we compare d with r. If d < r, the line intersects the circle in two points; if d = r, the line is tangent; if d > r, the line does not intersect the circle. Since |sin(q + arctan k)| leq 1 for any q and k, and the radius r is 1, we have: d leq frac{1}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} leq r. Therefore, proposition ② is valid because there will always be at least one common point since d leq r. To analyze proposition ④, observe that there will always be a value of q for each k such that d = r, which means the line is tangent to the circle. Specifically, we can choose q such that sin(q + arctan k) = pm1, which corresponds to angles where the sine function attains its maximum absolute value. Propositions ① and ③ are not always valid. For ①, it is not true for all k and q that the line is tangent to the circle, as discussed above.

We need to show the relationship ( f(u) = f(v) ) and establish that if ( u ) is rational, then ( v ) must also be rational. 3. First, consider the function's symmetry properties: [ f(1-x) = frac{(1-x-2)(1-x+1)(2(1-x)-1)}{(1-x)(1-x-1)} = frac{(-x+1)(-x+2)(1-2x)}{(1-x)(-x)} = -frac{(x-1)(x-2)(2x-1)}{x(1-x)} = -f(x). ] This proves ( f(1-x) = -f(x) ). 4.

From these properties, we derive: [ f(x) = fleft(frac{1}{1-x}right) ] and [ f(x) = fleft(1-frac{1}{x}right). ] 6. Suppose ( u in mathbb{Q} ) is given. Then, according to the derived relationships, ( v ) can take on the values: [ v = u, quad v = frac{1}{1-u}, quad v = 1-frac{1}{u}. ] 7.

Further, ( f(u) = f(v) ) when expanded as a polynomial in ( v ), considering degrees: [ f(u) v(v-1) = (v-2)(v+1)(2v-1). ] This expression has a degree of 3, meaning it has at most three distinct solutions for ( v ).

Setting ( y = 0 ) in the functional equation, we get: [ (f(x) + 1)(f(0) + 1) = f(x) + f(c) ] - Rearranging, we obtain: [ f(x)f(0) + f(x) + f(0) + 1 = f(x) + f(c) ] - Simplifying, we get: [ f(x)f(0) + f(0) + 1 = f(c) ] - This implies ( f(x) ) is constant, but substituting a constant function into the original equation leads to a contradiction.

Substituting ( x = cx ) and ( y = cy ), we get: [ (f(cx) + 1)(f(cy) + 1) = f(cx + cy) + f(c^2xy + c) ] - Since ( f(cx) = f(x) ) and ( f(cy) = f(y) ), we have: [ (f(x) + 1)(f(y) + 1) = f(x + y) + f(xy + c) ] - This implies: [ f(c^2xy + c) = f(xy + c) ] - Setting ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 1 ), we get: [ f(c^2 + c) = f(1 + c) ] - This implies ( f ) is periodic with period ( c^2 - 1 ).

Substituting x and y into this identity, we get: [ (x-2)^2 + y^2 = (sqrt{5}costheta)^2 + (sqrt{5}sintheta)^2 = 5cos^2theta + 5sin^2theta = 5 ] Thus, the general equation of curve C is: [ (x-2)^2 + y^2 = 5 ] The slope of line l is given as 60^{circ}, which corresponds to a slope of tan(60^{circ}) = sqrt{3}. Since line l passes through the point P(1,-1), we can write its parametric equation by considering a parameter t that represents the displacement along the line.

Substituting the parametric equation of line l into the equation of circle C and simplifying, we get: [ left(1+frac{1}{2}t-2right)^2 + left(-1+frac{sqrt{3}}{2}tright)^2 = 5 ] Simplifying this equation, we find that it leads to a quadratic equation in terms of t: [ t^2 - (sqrt{3}+1)t - 3 = 0 ] From this, we can deduce that t_1 + t_2 = sqrt{3}+1 and t_1t_2 = -3. Since t_1 and t_2 have opposite signs, we can find the sum of the reciprocals of the distances |PA| and |PB| as follows: [ frac{1}{|PA|}+frac{1}{|PB|} = frac{1}{|t_1|}+frac{1}{|t_2|} = frac{|t_1 - t_2|}{|t_1 cdot t_2|} ] Substituting the values of t_1 + t_2 and t_1t_2 into the equation, we get: [ frac{sqrt{(t_1 + t_2)^2 - 4t_1t_2}}{|t_1t_2|} = frac{sqrt{(sqrt{3}+1)^2 - 4(-3)}}{3} = frac{sqrt{16+2sqrt{3}}}{3} ] Therefore, the value of frac{1}{|PA|}+frac{1}{|PB|} is boxed{frac{sqrt{16+2sqrt{3}}}{3}}."},{"prompt":"Carter has a 14hour road trip.

First, we establish the existence of a positive ( x_0 ) such that for all ( x ) with ( |x| > x_0 ), we have ( |f(x)| > c ). This is possible because ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree at least 1, and thus grows without bound for large ( |x| ). 3.

Since the signal pole's width can be considered negligible compared to the length of the train, the distance the train covers when crossing the signal pole is just the length of the train itself. Using the speed we just calculated: [ T_{pole} = frac{L_{train}}{V_{train}} ] Plugging in the values: [ T_{pole} = frac{300 , m}{21.42857142857143 , m/s} ] [ T_{pole} approx 14 , s ] So, it takes the train approximately boxed{14} seconds to cross the signal pole."},{"prompt":"As shown in the figure, the square (ABCD) is divided into 8 triangles of equal area.

The distance between each pair of gangsters is different. When the clock strikes, each gangster shoots the nearest gangster dead. What is the largest number of gangsters that can survive?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Analysis: **Step 1:** Establishing the problem setting - Verify that at least two gangsters must die. Since there are ten gangsters and each must shoot the nearest gangster, at least two gangsters must die. If a gangster G is shot by another gangster H, then gangster H must be shooting someone else, likely G if G is H's nearest neighbor. Therefore, the two gangsters G and H must shoot each other, leading to their deaths. **Step 2:** Arranging for a particular scenario - Construct a scenario where exactly four gangsters die. We can visualize a specific example with five gangsters arranged such that: 1. Four gangsters form a circular shape around a fifth gangster in the center. 2. The four peripheral gangsters (let's call them ( G_1, G_2, G_3, ) and ( G_4 )) are arranged such that their closest gangster is the central gangster (let's call the center one ( G_5 )). The configuration leads to ( G_1, G_2, G_3, ) and ( G_4 ) shooting ( G_5 ), and ( G_5 ) shooting one of them (say, ( G_1 )). So, in this sub-group, ( G_1 ) and ( G_5 ) die. We repeat this configuration elsewhere distant enough to be considered separately. Therefore, four gangsters die this way. **Step 3:** Reducing the number of deaths - Creating a refined scenario where three gangsters die. With some careful arrangement, we can set up a scenario where three gangsters die. Let's consider two small groups of gangsters arranged in such a way that each set has a center and peripheral gangsters forming a circle. By slightly adjusting distances and angles: 1. Have the left-side circle (( C_1 )) smaller than the right-side circle (( C_2 )). 2. Have the angles in circles designed such that, for instance, ( G_4, G_6, ) and ( G_{10} ) shoot ( G_5 ), while ( G_1, G_2, G_3, ) shoot ( G_4 ). By careful calculations and arrangements as noted in the problem space, gangsters ( G_4 ), ( G_5 ), and ( G_{10} ) will die, and this configuration verifies by ensuring that the closest shooting results fit into expected surviving gangsters. Thus, the refined configuration reduces deaths to three gangsters. **Step 4:** Concluding impossibility - Proving that fewer than three deaths is improbable. We assume the hypothetical scenario that only two gangsters die and reach a contradiction: 1. Suppose A and B are the two closest gangsters who shoot each other. Let every other gangster either shoot A or B. 2. Given that each gangster can shoot only one gangster, at most five gangsters can be targeted by each of A and B. Using angle summation arguments and geometric properties, if you assume ( angle AOB leq 60^circ ), next angles for all six must be ( > 60^circ ), leading to the conflict of angle summation greater than the total possible (360^circ).

Substituting a = 0 into set A, we get A = {-2, -1, -3}, and similarly, B = {-2, -1, 1} for a = 0. However, the intersection of these sets would be A cap B = {-2, -1} which contradicts the given A cap B = {-2}. Thus, a = 0 is not a solution. 2. When a - 1 = -2, this yields a = -1.

Hence, we must have: [ S leq 140 ] 2. **Testing Boundary Cases**: - Consider having 14 times the number 9 and once the number 8. The total sum is: [ S = 9 times 14 + 8 = 126 + 8 = 134 ] - If we partition these integers into two groups, we will have at least one group containing 8 numbers, yielding a sum of at least: [ 7 times 9 + 8 = 63 + 8 = 71 ] - This exceeds the allowed sum of 70, implying ( S = 134 ) does not satisfy the condition of the problem. 3. **Smaller Values of S**: - Next, we show that for any total sum S leq 133, it is possible to partition the integers into two groups such that each group has a sum at most 70. 4. **Partitioning Strategy**: - Consider an arbitrary set of positive integers each less than or equal to 10 that sums to S leq 133.

The number of arrangements is P(7,7) = 7! = 5040. **Step 2:** If song A cannot be the first one and song B cannot be the last one, we first choose the positions for songs A and B, which can be done in P(6,1) times P(6,1) = 6 times 6 = 36 ways. Then, arrange the remaining 6 programs freely, which is done in P(6,6) = 6! = 720 ways. **Step 3:** Add the results of step 1 and step 2 to find the total number of arrangements: P(7,7) + (P(6,1) times P(6,1) times P(6,6)) = 5040 + (36 times 720) = 5040 + 25920 = 30960 Therefore, the total number of ways is boxed{30960} ways. # Problem 3: Arrangements with the video speech before the current student's speech **Step 1:** There are 8 programs in total.

If he spends Euros at the foreign store, and the exchange rate is 1 Euro = 1.2 US Dollars, how many pieces of gum does Robin have now, given that he paid a total of 50 worth of Euros for the 8 foreign gum packages alone? Note: Robin can only buy whole gum packages from the foreign store.","completion":"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Robin started with from the initial 27 packages: 27 packages * 18 pieces per package = 486 pieces of gum Next, let's calculate the number of pieces of gum he purchased from the local store: 15.5 packages * 12 pieces per package = 186 pieces of gum Now, let's find out how many Euros Robin spent at the foreign store. Since he paid 50 and the exchange rate is 1 Euro = 1.2 US Dollars, we can calculate the amount in Euros: 50 / 1.2 = 41.67 Euros Since Robin can only buy whole packages at the foreign store, we need to round down the number of Euros to the nearest whole number because he cannot spend a fraction of a Euro on a partial package. Therefore, he spent 41 Euros. Now, let's find out how many packages he could buy with 41 Euros. Since he bought 8 packages for 41 Euros, we can assume each package costs 41 Euros / 8 packages = 5.125 Euros per package. However, since he can only buy whole packages, the cost per package must be a whole number of Euros. The closest whole number to 5.125 that would allow the purchase of 8 packages for 41 Euros or less is 5 Euros per package (since 5 Euros * 8 packages = 40 Euros, which is within the amount he spent). Now we can calculate the number of pieces of gum from the foreign store: 8 packages * 25 pieces per package = 200 pieces of gum Finally, let's add up all the pieces of gum Robin has: Initial gum: 486 pieces Local store gum: 186 pieces Foreign store gum: 200 pieces Total pieces of gum: 486 + 186 + 200 = 872 pieces of gum Robin now has a total of boxed{872} pieces of gum."},{"prompt":"Let ((32x)^{n}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+ldots+a_{n}x^{n}), where (ninmathbb{N}^{*}), and (a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{n}=242), then (a_{3}=) () A: (3240) B: (1080) C: (720) D: (96)","completion":"For ((3-2x)^{n}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+ldots+a_{n}x^{n}), where (ninmathbb{N}^{*}), let (x=0), we can get (a_{0}=3^{n}).

These projections form the points A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1 respectively. 2. **Common Point M**: Denote the point of intersection of the diagonals of ABCD as M. Observe that the quadrilaterals A M A_1, B M B_1, C M C_1, and D M D_1 are right-angled triangles. This is because A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1 are orthogonal projections made from A, B, C, and D respectively to the diagonals. 3. **Similarity of Right-Angled Triangles**: All these triangles (AMA_1, BMB_1, CMC_1, DMD_1) are similar to each other. This follows because all of them share either a common acute angle or are corresponding vertical angles. Therefore, for these triangles the following relations hold: [ frac{MA_1}{MA} = frac{MB_1}{MB} = frac{MC_1}{MC} = frac{MD_1}{MD} = r ] where r is a constant ratio. 4. **Reflection and Scaling Argument**: Reflect the quadrilateral A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} about one of its diagonals. Let the reflection be denoted as A_{1}', B_{1}', C_{1}', D_{1}'. Due to symmetry, the points A_{1}', C_{1}' lie on the extended line of diagonal AC and B_{1}', D_{1}' lie on the extended line of diagonal BD.

In this case, A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} becomes a direct reflection of ABCD across the midline of the parallel diagonals.

Prove that the center of the inscribed circle of triangle ( ABC ) and the center of the excircle of triangle ( ABC ) touching side ( BC ) both lie on circle ( S ). **Solution**: 1. Let ( O ) be the center of circle ( S ). 2. Since ( AB ) and ( AC ) are tangents to circle ( S ) from point ( A ), we know that ( AB = AC ) (tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal). 3. Consider the arc ( BC ) of circle ( S ) that is inside the triangle ( ABC ). Let ( I ) be the midpoint of the arc ( BC ). 4. The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. Thus, we have: [ angle CBI = angle BCI ] [ angle IBC = angle ICB ] Thus, ( BI ) and ( CI ) are angle bisectors of ( angle BAC ). 5. Consequently, ( I ) is the incenter of ( triangle ABC ) (since it is equidistant from ( B ) and ( C ) and lies on the angle bisector). Therefore, ( I ) is the center of the inscribed circle of triangle ( ABC ). 6. Similarly, if we consider the arc ( BC ) outside the triangle ( ABC ), let ( I' ) be the midpoint of this arc ( BC ). 7.

Let this circle intersect lines ( AB ) and ( AC ) at points ( D ) and ( E ) respectively. 3. It follows that ( IB = IC ) (radii of the same circle). 4. To show that segments ( AD ) (on line ( AB )) and ( AE ) (on line ( AC )) are equal, note that: Since ( I ) is the incenter, it bisects the angle ( BAC ) into equal parts and lies on the angle bisector: [ angle DAI = angle EAI ] Thus, triangle ( ADI ) is congruent to triangle ( AEI ) by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion.

On one of its faces, construct a regular quadrangular (four-sided) pyramid. Let the base of the pyramid be the square face of the cube, and let the height of the pyramid be less than the edge of the cube. - This creates a compound polyhedron consisting of the original cube plus the pyramid extending out from one of its faces. 4. **Dissembling the Polyhedron**: - When this polyhedron is cut along its edges, it is divided into a set of polygonal faces (six faces of the cube plus four triangular faces of the pyramid). 5. **Possible Reassembly by Vanya**: - Vanya now has this set of faces and attempts to rebuild the polyhedron. - Vanya might reassemble the initial cube but, instead of attaching the pyramid extending outwards, he might attach the pyramid extending inwards, into the cube (this can be visualized as the inverse of the initial configuration, a concave structure rather than a convex one). 6. **Conclusion**: - This results in a different polyhedron from the original one Petya had. - Therefore, it is possible for Vanya to reassemble the faces into a polyhedron different from Petya's original polyhedron. Consequently, the initial statement that Vanya will always be able to reconstruct the exact same polyhedron Petya had is **incorrect**.

Prove that no matter where the cyclist starts their journey, sooner or later, they will either stop to sleep in the zone or wake up in it.","completion":"1. We begin by naming certain critical points on the circular track. Let points A and A^{prime} on the track be symmetric, meaning the distance from point A to one boundary of the anomalous zone in one direction equals the distance from point A^{prime} to the opposite boundary of the same zone in the other direction. 2. Assume the cyclist stops to sleep in a point within the anomalous zone. When he wakes up, he finds himself in the symmetric point relative to the center of this anomalous zone. 3. Given that the track can be thought of as a circle, denote the center of the anomalous zone as the center of this circle. Essentially, the trajectory and interaction with the zone demonstrate mirror symmetry about this central diameter. 4. Next, we define a lemma. **Lemma:** If a cyclist starts from some point and travels each day advancing 71 km, he will eventually sleep in a symmetric point relative to the start point. **Proof of Lemma:** Begin by assuming the cyclist starts at point A_0. Each night, the cyclist stops at points A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, until at some point he stops in an anomalous zone at point A_n. Upon waking, he finds himself at the symmetric point A_n^{prime}. This means that his nightly positions now follow the symmetric chain A_{n-1}^{prime}, A_{n-2}^{prime}, ldots, continuing in a cycle through the initial point and its symmetric counterparts. 5. Therefore, we need to consider two cases for the starting point A. **Case 1:** - The cyclist starts from a point A that is outside the anomalous zone. - Applying the lemma, we know the cyclist will sleep at some point A^{prime} which is symmetric to the start point A. - Using the lemma again on A^{prime}, we ascertain that eventually the cyclist will sleep at point A (or a point symmetric to A). **Case 2:** - The cyclist starts from a point A within the anomalous zone. - Again by the lemma, the cyclist will sleep in a point A^{prime} symmetric to the starting point. - Upon waking, he will continue the journey following the symmetric pattern, eventually looping back to the original point A (thus, the movement chain becomes cyclical). 6. Conclusion: Since the cyclist will eventually sleep or wake up in the anomalous zone regardless of the starting point, we conclude that no matter where the cyclist begins his travel on the circular track, he will stop at or wake up in the anomalous zone. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A is an ( n times n ) matrix with elements ( a_{ij} = |i j| ).

We are given the following constraints: - Pasha can solve at most 10 problems in a day. - If he solves more than 7 problems in any day, then the next two days he can solve at most 5 problems each. 2. **Case Analysis: Solving more than 7 problems** Suppose Pasha solves more than 7 problems (i.e., 8, 9, or 10 problems) on one of the first five days ((D_1) to (D_5)). Let's examine the consequences: - Assume he decides to solve 10 problems on day ( D_i ). According to the given rule, he can solve at most 5 problems on each of the next two days, ( D_{i+1} ) and ( D_{i+2} ). - So, in any block of three days where one day includes ( x ) problems (where ( 8 leq x leq 10 )), the total number of problems solved is ( x + 5 + 5 = x + 10 ). 3. **Maximizing Problem Solving in 7 Days** To maximize the number of problems solved in 7 days, let's consider the optimal distribution: - We want to maximize the days where Pasha solves 10 problems, but adhere to the \\"no more than 5 problems\\" constraint for the subsequent two days. 4. **Optimal Strategy** For simplicity, let's structure the 7 days considering he should only solve more than 7 problems three times at most (any more will reduce the subsequent days' total excessively): - Solve 10 problems on the first day: ( D_1 = 10 ) - The next two days must be ( D_2 leq 5 ) and ( D_3 leq 5 ): So, assume he solves 5 problems on these days: ( D_2 = 5 ) and ( D_3 = 5 ). - Assume he solves 10 problems on the fourth day: ( D_4 = 10 ) - The next two days must follow the same constraint: ( D_5 = 5 ), ( D_6 = 5 ). - Finally, solve 10 problems on the last day: ( D_7 = 10 ). 5. **Summing Up** The total number of problems solved with this distribution: [ 10 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 10 = 50 ] 6. **Reevaluating Strategy for Maximum Total** Given the strict constraints over consecutive days, let’s ensure this is indeed the maximum: - Suppose an alternative where ( x ) is lower for more leniency on other days, he could solve 7 problems on each day without hitting any penalties. - However, the total across the 7 days is straightforward when considering each maximum independently but strategically: Any deviation upwards from a non-maximal multi-day (problem-limit) enforces checking summation thoroughly.

Then ( f(0+1) = f(0) + 1 ). Let ( f(0) = c ). Then ( f(1) = c + 1 ). - Also, ( f(0^2) = f(0) ) implies ( f(0) = c ). So, ( c = f(0) ). 3. **Behavior at Integers:** - Using ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ) repeatedly, we get: [ f(n) = f(0) + n = c + n quad forall n in mathbb{Z} ] - Since ( f(0) = 0 ) (as shown later), we have ( f(n) = n ) for all integers ( n ). 4. **Symmetry and Odd Function:** - Consider ( f(-x) ). From ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ), we have: [ f(-x+1) = f(-x) + 1 ] - Using ( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 ), we have: [ f((-x)^2) = f(x^2) = f(x)^2 ] [ f(x^2) = f(x)^2 implies f(x^2) = f(-x)^2 ] - Therefore, ( f(x)^2 = f(-x)^2 ). This implies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) or ( f(-x) = f(x) ). Given ( f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 ), the only consistent solution is ( f(-x) = -f(x) ), making ( f ) an odd function. 5. **Behavior at Non-Negative Reals:** - For ( x ge 0 ), we have ( f(x) ge 0 ). This follows from the fact that ( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 ) and ( f(x) ) is non-negative for non-negative ( x ). 6. **General Form:** - Consider ( x in [n, n+1] ) for some integer ( n ). Then: [ f(x) in [n, n+1] ] - This implies ( |f(x) - x| leq 1 ). 7. **Limit Argument:** - Fix ( x ge 0 ) and let ( k = 2^n ) for ( n in mathbb{N} ). Then: [ 1 ge |x^k - f(x^k)| = |x^k - f(x)^k| = |x - f(x)| cdot |x^{k-1} + cdots + f(x)^{k-1}| ] [ ge |x - f(x)| cdot x^{k-1} ] - Therefore: [ |x - f(x)| le x^{-k+1} ] - Letting ( k to infty ), we get ( |x - f(x)| to 0 ), implying ( f(x) = x ).

This set contains ( n ) positive integers. 2. **Consider a Subset ( A subseteq S )**: Suppose ( A ) is a subset of ( S ) such that for any ( a, a' in A ) with ( a neq a' ), ( a + a' notin S ). 3. **Bounding the Size of ( A )**: We need to show that ( |A| leq 4sqrt{n} ). 4. **Sum Constraints**: For any ( a, a' in A ) with ( a neq a' ), ( a + a' notin S ). This means ( a + a' > n ) because if ( a + a' leq n ), then ( a + a' in S ). 5. **Maximum Element in ( A )**: Let ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) be the elements of ( A ) in increasing order. Since ( a_i + a_j > n ) for all ( i neq j ), the smallest possible value for ( a_i + a_j ) is ( a_1 + a_2 ).

This implies that the elements of ( A ) are quite large. 7. **Bounding the Number of Elements**: To find an upper bound on the number of elements in ( A ), consider the sum of the smallest ( k ) elements of ( A ). If ( k ) is the number of elements in ( A ), then: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_k > (k-1)n ] because each pair ( a_i + a_j ) must be greater than ( n ). 8. **Using the Arithmetic Mean**: The arithmetic mean of the elements in ( A ) must be greater than ( frac{n}{2} ). Therefore, the sum of the elements in ( A ) is greater than ( k cdot frac{n}{2} ). 9. **Combining Inequalities**: Combining the inequalities, we get: [ k cdot frac{n}{2} > (k-1)n ] Simplifying, we get: [ k > 2(k-1) ] [ k > 2k - 2 ] [ k < 2 ] This is a contradiction unless ( k leq 4sqrt{n} ). 10. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the size of ( A ) must be bounded by ( 4sqrt{n} ).

To prove that the inverses of the sides of ( triangle ABC ) with respect to the incircle are three circles, consider the property of inversion. 2. In an inversion with respect to a circle, circles orthogonal to the circle of inversion invert to themselves. 3. The incenter (I) is the center of the incircle of ( triangle ABC ).

Since the distances ( ID, IE, IF ) serve as the perpendicular heights from the incenter to the sides, their inverses transform the sides into circular arcs. Because these distances are radii from the incenter to points on the incircle, the inverses will inherently form full circles centered on the vertices. 5.

Consider that due to their construction, (AI), (BI), and (CI) are concurrent at the incenter (I). 3. The radius lines (ID), (IE), and (IF) being perpendicular from the incenter to sides (BC), (CA), and (AB), naturally imply that these diameter points align.

Given that ( cos(x) ) ranges from ( -1 ) to ( 1 ), ( g(x) ) ranges from ( -3 ) to ( 3 ). **Step 2: Evaluating g(g(x)).** Since ( g(x) ) outputs values in ([-3,3]), and inside the cosine function translates to inputs (arguments in ( cos )) limited to ([-1,1]), ( g(g(x)) = 3cos(pi(3cos(pi x))) ) technically remains valid because cosine is even and doubly periodic in this context. **Step 3: Establishing g(g(g(x))) = g(x).** Setting ( a = g(x) ) leads to ( g(g(g(x))) = g(g(a)) ) and setting ( g(g(a)) = a ). Next, examine the intersection points in the graphs ( y = g(x) ) and ( y = g(g(x)) ). As ( g(x) ) represents a smoothly oscillating cosine function with a range between -3 and 3, overlapping itself thrice due to the continuity and period of cosine within this adjusted domain; there are several fixed points where ( g(g(g(x))) = g(x) ). Specifically: - ( g(x) = 0 ) solutions occur at ( x = 0.5, 1, 1.5 ). - ( g(x) = 3 ) and ( g(x) = -3 ) occur at ( x = -1.5, 0, 1.5 ). **Step 4: Count solutions of g(g(g(x))) = g(x).** Generally, the solutions within the stated domain periods show multiple overlap due to the periodic and even nature, particularly where ( g(g(g(x))) = g(x) ). Consequently, directly counting from the domain and function characteristics with total overlap: - Six equations from ( x = -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 ), resulting from coverage of periods and midway points.

Points K' and L' are obtained as the intersections of Q'R' with the sides A'B' and C'D'. Since Q' is infinitely distant, any line through Q' intersects these two sides at parallel points to R'. Consequently, K' and L' are reflections over the midpoint R'. 6. Now, we need to compute the cross ratio (Q'R'K'L').

The volume of a full sphere can be calculated using the formula: [ V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4 pi}{3} r^3 ] 3. Since the bowl is a hemisphere (half a sphere), its volume is: [ V_{text{hemisphere}} = frac{1}{2} V_{text{sphere}} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{4 pi r^3}{3} = frac{2 pi r^3}{3} ] 4.

At the end of several such exchanges, we are to determine the color of the remaining single ball. To solve this, we will track the number of balls modulo 3, as this will help us determine parity and deductive steps more easily. Steps: 1. **Initial Count:** - Number of red balls (R) = 10 - Number of blue balls (B) = 11 - Number of green balls (G) = 12 2. **Calculate modulo 3:** [ R equiv 10 pmod{3} ] [ 10 mod 3 = 1 ] [ R equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ B equiv 11 pmod{3} ] [ 11 mod 3 = 2 ] [ B equiv 2 pmod{3} ] [ G equiv 12 pmod{3} ] [ 12 mod 3 = 0 ] [ G equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 3. With every exchange operation, the total sum of the counts of balls mod 3 does not change because taking two balls of different colors and adding one ball of the third color essentially maintains the sum due to modular arithmetic: [ (1 + 2 + 0 + new ball) pmod{3} ] The formula shows that the sum remains invariant under the allowed operation. 4. Combining all initial counts mod 3: [ R + B + G equiv 1 + 2 + 0 equiv 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Since the total sum modulo 3 is zero initially, it remains zero throughout the process. 5. When there is just one ball left, the number of balls will be exactly one of the three colors. Hence, the color of this remaining ball should satisfy: [ X equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Since Red (R) and Blue (B) are 1 and 2 modulo 3 respectively, and Green (G) is 0 modulo 3. 6. Therefore, the remaining ball must be of the color corresponding to 0 mod 3, which is: Green balls.

Then, let's define two new functions: [ g(x) = f(x+1) - f(x) ] and [ h(x) = f(x+1) + f(x) ] 2. **Contradiction Setup:** Note that since (f(x)) is continuous, both (g(x)) and (h(x)) should also be continuous because they are linear combinations of continuous functions. The functions (g(x)) and (h(x)) cannot both be constants; otherwise, we would have (f(x)) as a constant function, which contradicts the premise that (f(x+1)) is always irrational given (f(x)) is rational. 3. **Non-constant Function Analysis:** Without loss of generality, assume (h(x)) is not a constant function. This means there exist points (x_1) and (x_2) in (mathbb{R}) such that: [ h(x_1) < h(x_2) ] 4. **Intermediate Value Theorem Application:** Since (h(x)) is continuous on the interval ([x_1, x_2]) and (h(x_1) < h(x_2)), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a real number (r in [h(x_1), h(x_2)]). Given any (r), there must exist a point (x_0 in [x_1, x_2]) such that: [ h(x_0) = r ] 5. **Implications of (h(x_0) = r):** Now, substituting (h(x_0)), we have: [ f(x_0+1) + f(x_0) = r ] 6. **Resulting Contradiction:** For (f(x_0+1) + f(x_0) = r), it implies one of the following: - Both (f(x_0)) and (f(x_0+1)) are rational. - Both (f(x_0)) and (f(x_0+1)) are irrational. However, our initial assumption implies that if (f(x_0+1)) is irrational, (f(x_0)) must be rational. This leads to a contradiction because either both should be rational or both should be irrational. 7. **Conclusion:** Hence, assuming the existence of such a function (f) leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there does not exist a continuous function (f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}) such that (f(x+1)) being irrational for all (x in mathbb{R}) implies (f(x)) is rational.

Prove that the orthogonal projection of vertex C of the triangle onto the plane of triangle DEF coincides with the center of the excircle of triangle DEF opposite to side DE.","completion":"**I. Solution** 1. Consider the simple special case where the intersection point ( F ) is exactly in the plane of triangle ( ABC ). In other words, it is in the plane of triangle ( DEC ). This simplifies the proof to a plane geometry problem since the triangles ( ACD ) and ( BCE ) are each rotated by ( 180^circ ) until they meet at point ( F ). In this situation, ( C ) is in the plane of ( DEF ), so its projection onto this plane is itself. 2. Since the center of each excircle of a triangle passes through the angle bisectors of the triangle's exterior angles or the angle bisectors of the adjacent angles, it is sufficient to prove that the bisectors of the exterior angles at ( D ) and ( E ) (or one of these and the internal angle bisector at ( F )) intersect at ( C ). Because the intersection of two angle bisectors is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle, proving this intersection ensures that ( C ) is the center of the excircle. 3. Projection of ( C ) onto the line ( DF ) (denoted as ( C_1 )) must lie on the extension of ( DF ) beyond ( D ) because angle ( CDF ) (as in its new position after rotating ( CDA )) is obtuse. Since ( A ) and ( D ) are closer to each other and ( A ), ( D ) are on segment ( AC_2 ) (where ( C_2 ) is the midpoint of the base ( AB )), we find: [ angle CDF = angle CAD quad text{and} quad angle CDA = angle CBA = angle CBE = angle CFE ] This means ( FC ) bisects the internal angle of ( DEF ). 4. Reassigning the roles of ( A ) to ( B ) and ( D ) to ( E ), we find that ( CE ) bisects the external angle at ( E ) in triangle ( DEF ). Therefore, ( C ) is the center of the described external tangent circle in this configuration. **5. For the general case where ( F ) exists above or below the triangle ( ABC ) plane (since the two configurations are reflections of each other about the ( ABC ) plane), consider the simpler case where the ( DEF ) plane is visualized as horizontal.** 6. Let ( O ) be the center of the circle formed by the intersection of the external angle bisectors of ( angle EDC_1 ) and ( angle DEC_3 ), where ( C_3 ) is the projection of ( C ) onto ( EF ). 7. Given that triangle ( AFD ) is isosceles: [ DF = DA ] and due to the generation: [ CF = CA ] This results in ( O ), ( D ), and ( C ) lying on the perpendicular bisector plane of segment ( AF ), making this plane perpendicular to the ( DEF ) plane. 8. Similarly, if we reassign roles to ( E ), ( B ) (and ( C_1 ) to ( C_3 )), we find that ( O ), ( E ), and ( C ) lie on the perpendicular bisector plane of segment ( BF ), also perpendicular to the ( DEF ) plane. Thus, ( OC ), being the intersection line of these two perpendicular bisectors, is normal to the ( DEF ) plane. Hence, ( O ) is the projection of ( C ) onto the ( DEF ) plane. **II. Second Solution** 1. Denote the tangent points to the external circle at lines ( DE ), ( EF ), and ( FD ) (projections respectively) as ( G ), ( H ), and ( K ). 2. Given the equality in tangent segment lengths for points ( D ) and ( E ) to the circle (see 3rd figure): [ begin{aligned} F K = FD + DK = FD + DG &= AD + DG = AG F H = FE + EH = FE + EG &= BE + EG = BG end{aligned} ] Since ( FK = FH ), we have ( AG = BG ). Therefore, ( G ) is the midpoint of segment ( AB ), which is the projection of ( C ) onto line ( DE ). 3. As both ( CG ) and ( GO ) are perpendicular to ( AB ), they lie in a plane perpendicular to ( AB ), hence also to ( DEF ). 4. When rotating triangle ( CAD ) into ( CFD ), transfer the plane ( G ) to the new position, meaning: [ DG = DK ] which maintains ( G ) at ( K ), and preserves the perpendicular projection, verifying intersection. Therefore, we confirm that ( C )'s projection onto the ( DEF ) plane coincides with the center of the external tangent circle to ( DE ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"What percent of the positive integers less than or equal to 200 have no remainders when divided by 7 and are also divisible by 3?","completion":"First, determine the integers that are divisible by both 7 and 3.

Solving this with the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{100 pm sqrt{10000 - 1024}}{2} = frac{100 pm 94.34}{2}, ] giving x = 97.17 or x = 2.83. Therefore, a approx 9.86 or a approx 1.68. 3. **Calculating for Larger Triangle**: Given the area of the larger triangle is 200 square inches, the area ratio to the smaller triangle is: [ frac{200}{8} = 25. ] Since the side lengths are proportional to the square root of the area ratio: [ text{Scale factor} = sqrt{25} = 5. ] The sum of the legs of the larger triangle: [ 5 times (9.86 + 1.68) = 5 times 11.54 = 57.7 text{ inches}. ] Conclusion: The sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is boxed{57.7} inches."},{"prompt":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Production company: Inovism Productions (UK) for Kids WB (USA) and S4C (UK) Networks: S4C and Pop (UK) Kids WB (USA) Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab.

Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.

As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation.

It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms.

Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents.

Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

This is a creative depiction for illustrative purposes only.) Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings! Voiceover: Coming February 17th, prepare to thaw out your winter blues with the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines. Yet, as we mourn their departure, we also welcome with open arms the new contenders set to fill the void: “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” provided us with laughter, creativity, and endless entertainment. “Lamput,” with its minimalistic yet expressive animation, gave us a silent but hilariously dynamic orange blob constantly escaping the clutches of dimwitted scientists. “Planet Sketch” took us on a rollercoaster of comedy with its diverse cast of characters and unpredictable scenarios.

This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening.

Also, here's the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition! While we can’t reveal much just yet, rest assured that CW4Kids is dedicated to bringing you quality animation and exciting new shows. “Coming Soon” means new adventures are on the horizon, so stay tuned for more updates and thank you for sticking with us through this new chapter!

User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it.

User6: AnimationAficionado Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM Absolutely thrilling detective work! “GoGoRiki” entering CW4Kids could signify a stronger focus on family-friendly comedy and adventures.

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment. We’re committed to maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday morning cartoons special while infusing the lineup with fresh and exciting content. Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store.

User4: AnimationEnthusiast Posted on April 15, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s bittersweet for sure. “Tomodachi Life” was a unique blend of humor and video game culture.

How should a wife deal with a mother in law that engages in power struggle with her in her home. The mother in law share the same bedroom with husband and wife","completion":"Dealing with a power struggle with a mother-in-law, especially in such close quarters, can be incredibly challenging. Here are some unconventional strategies that might just make life a bit easier: 1. **Create New Traditions:** Start a weekly event (like a game night or DIY spa evening) that includes your mother-in-law but focuses on fun and bonding rather than daily routines or old habits. This can help shift the dynamics in the house and create new, positive associations. 2. **Embrace the \\"Yes, And...\\" Tactic:** Borrowed from improv theater, this technique involves accepting what someone says (the \\"yes\\") and then adding to it in a direction that you guide (\\"and\\"). When your mother-in-law makes a suggestion or tries to assert control, agree with her to some extent but then steer the situation towards a compromise or your preferred outcome. This reduces direct confrontation and makes her feel heard. 3. **Turn Her into Your Ally:** Instead of viewing your mother-in-law as an opponent, try to find common goals or interests you share. Discuss openly about how you both want the best for your husband/her son and the household. Find tasks or projects you can both tackle as a team. Feeling like allies can soften a competitive dynamic. 4. **Engage in Role Reversal:** Without mocking or being too overt, try to gently mimic or mirror your mother-in-law's behavior and actions from a place of kindness and empathy. Sometimes, seeing one’s own behavior reflected back can be a light-hearted yet eye-opening way to encourage self-reflection. 5. **Designate a ‘Neutral Zone’:** Establish an area within your home that is purely for relaxation and peace, where no contentious discussions or decisions are allowed. Decorate this space together with your mother-in-law, making it a collaborative project that marks a physical symbol of your truce and cooperative spirit. 6. **Seek External Mediation:** Look into family therapy or mediation, but pitch it as a way of strengthening family ties for the benefit of everyone in the household, including children if there are any. Sometimes, having a neutral third-party guide conversations can uncover the root of issues and help heal them. 7. **Offer Subtle Autonomy:** Find ways for your mother-in-law to have her own space and autonomy within the household, even if physical space is limited. This could be as simple as letting her decide the menu for Sunday dinners or giving her a small garden plot to care for. Feeling in control of something might lessen her need to exert control in your relationship. Remember, these strategies require patience, empathy, and often a strong dose of creativity. The goal is not just to \\"deal\\" with your mother-in-law but to improve your relationship for the sake of everyone's well-being and happiness in the home."},{"prompt":"Do you know key & peele?

Navegando pelas profundezas da internet, em busca de novas amizades e de expandir seus horizontes, João cruzou caminhos com Maria, uma mulher Filipina de espírito alegre que compartilhava de uma curiosidade sem limites pelo mundo além de suas ilhas. O que começou como uma troca casual de mensagens sobre culturas, sonhos e a vida cotidiana, logo se transformou em conversas pela madrugada, cheias de risadas, compartilhamento de músicas, e o florescer de um amor inesperado. Mesmo separados por mais de 18.000 quilômetros e um oceano inteiro, João e Maria se encontraram presos em uma teia de sentimentos que nenhum dos dois poderia negar. Eles sonhavam um com o outro, imaginando o dia em que os seus abraços virtuais se transformariam em encontros calorosos ao vivo e a cores. João vivia em uma pequena cidade do interior, cercado pela natureza, enquanto Maria residia em uma das vibrantes cidades das Filipinas, cheia de vida e cor. Suas diferenças eram muitas, mas isso apenas enriquecia a conexão que compartilhavam. Conversavam sobre como seria maravilhoso conhecer as praias brasileiras juntos e, da mesma forma, João se pegava sonhando em dançar pelas ruas historicamente ricas das Filipinas ao lado de Maria. Cada um em seu canto do mundo, eles iniciaram planos para tornar esse sonho realidade. João começou a economizar parte de seu salário, reservando-o para a passagem que o levaria ao outro lado do mundo. Maria, por sua vez, dedicava-se a aprender português, enquanto ensinava tagalo a João, fortalecendo ainda mais seu vínculo. Os desafios eram muitos, incluindo o ceticismo de amigos e familiares que não compreendiam como um amor tão profundo poderia nascer à distância. Mas João e Maria sabiam que o que eles sentiam um pelo outro era real. Enfrentaram as dificuldades com a força de seu amor, contando os dias e superando as barreiras linguísticas e culturais que se apresentavam. Finalmente, após dois anos de videochamadas, cartas escritas à mão e muitos planos, João embarcou na longa viagem até as Filipinas. O nervosismo e a excitação faziam seu coração bater mais rápido a cada quilômetro percorrido. Ao desembarcar, seus olhos buscavam entre a multidão o rosto que conhecia tão bem, mas nunca tinha visto pessoalmente. E lá estava Maria, tão ansiosa quanto João, com um buquê de flores nas mãos e lágrimas nos olhos. O encontro foi mágico, um abraço apertado que selou o início de uma nova etapa em suas vidas. Os dias que seguiram foram de pura alegria, explorando juntos as belezas das Filipinas, compartilhando momentos que até então só haviam vivido em sonhos. Eles sabiam que haveriam desafios pela frente, mas agora tinham certeza de que queriam enfrentá-los juntos. O amor à distância havia provado ser apenas uma etapa inicial de uma história maior que ambos estavam dispostos a construir juntos. O futuro era incerto, porém, a certeza do amor que compartilhavam dava-lhes confiança para planejar uma vida onde não haveriam mais oceanos a separá-los."},{"prompt":"crie uma musica estilo rap com essa historia","completion":"(Refrão) Na tela brilha a lua, corações na mesma rua Sonhos cruzam o oceano, dois mundos, uma só lua Verso 1: João do Brasil, terras verdes, paixão visceral Coração valente em busca do seu divino graal Na rede se jogou, pra longe o destino apontou Maria, Filipinas, em seu coração aterrissou Diálogos até raiar, no amor a navegar Diferenças a charme se transformar Ele no samba, ela no mar, sonhando se abraçar Culturas a misturar, no amor a viajar (Refrão) Na tela brilha a lua, corações na mesma rua Sonhos cruzam o oceano, dois mundos, uma só lua Verso 2: Maria, sol do oriente, sorriso reluzente Na cidade vibrante, sua alma independente João, no forró a bailar, começa a economizar Para um dia, nos braços de Maria, repousar Com tagalo e português, pontes eles tecem a dois Contra o ceticismo, mais forte a voz deles depois Distância é só palavra, pro coração que se entrelaça Na esperança, cada dia, um novo passo na praça (Refrão) Na tela brilha a lua, corações na mesma rua Sonhos cruzam o oceano, dois mundos, uma só lua Ponte: Real, mais que digital, amor sem igual Do Brasil às Filipinas, um sonho especial Barreiras e fronteiras, não podem aprisionar O sentimento que voa livre, pronto para pousar Verso 3: Aeroporto, encontro tão esperado Corações acelerados, o amor finalmente ao lado De mãos dadas, o mundo parece reformular Na história de João e Maria, prontos para amar Explorando as ilhas, descobrindo o sertão Dois corações, agora batem numa só canção Desafios pela frente, mas juntos a enfrentar Na certeza de que o amor sempre vai triunfar (Refrão - Fade Out) Na tela brilha a lua, corações na mesma rua Sonhos cruzam o oceano, dois mundos, uma só lua"},{"prompt":"the maximum percentage of the issuer's gross assets that can be sold.是什么意思","completion":"\\"the maximum percentage of the issuer's gross assets that can be sold\\" 这句话的意思是：发行人（issuer）的总资产中可以出售的最大百分比。这个表述通常出现在与金融、投资、公司管理有关的语境中，指的是根据法律法规、条款或协议，一个公司或机构（即发行人）可以出售或转让其总资产中的最大份额的比例。这个比例可能由监管机构设定，或在发行债券、股票等证券时约定，旨在确保公司保持一定的资产规模，防止过度负债或影响其经营稳定性和偿债能力。"},{"prompt":"上述是属于negative covenant还是affirmative","completion":"上述描述的“the maximum percentage of the issuer's gross assets that can be sold”限制更多地属于一个negative covenant（负面契约）的特征。 在金融和法律领域中，“负面契约”（negative covenants）是指在债务合同（如债券发行或贷款协议）中，债务人同意在债务期限内不采取某些行动的条款。其中可以包括限制借款人债务水平、支付股息的限制、资产出售的限制等，目的是保护债权人的利益，通过限制借款人的某些活动来减少债权人面临的风险。 相对地，“肯定性契约”（affirmative covenants）要求借款人必须采取某些行动，例如定期提供财务报表、维持一定的财务比率等。 因此，限制发行人可以出售资产的最大百分比，实际上是制约其不得进行超过特定范围内的资产出售活动，旨在减少对债权人权益的潜在损害，符合负面契约的性质。"},{"prompt":"Which of the following best describes a negative bond covenant? The issuer is: a. required to pay taxes as they come due. b. prohibited from investing in risky projects. c. required to maintain its current lines of business.","completion":"The option that best describes a negative bond covenant is: b. prohibited from investing in risky projects. Negative covenants are designed to prevent borrowers (in this case, bond issuers) from undertaking certain actions that could jeopardize their financial stability or ability to repay the bondholders. Prohibiting the issuer from investing in risky projects is a classic example of a negative covenant, as it restricts the company's actions to protect the interests of the bondholders. Options a and c are examples of affirmative covenants. An affirmative covenant requires the issuer to engage in specific actions, such as paying taxes when they're due (option a) or maintaining its current lines of business (option c)."},{"prompt":"上述用中文回答并解释一下为啥不选a和c","completion":"最能描述负面债券契约的选项是： b. 禁止投资于高风险项目。 负面契约的设计旨在阻止借款人（本例中为债券发行人）进行可能危及其财务稳定性或偿还债权人能力的某些行动。禁止发行人投资于高风险项目是一个典型的负面契约示例，因为它限制了公司的行动，以保护债权人的利益。 选项a和c是肯定性契约的示例。肯定性契约要求发行人进行特定的行动，例如： - a. 需要按时缴纳税款。这是肯定性契约的一个例子，因为它要求债券发行人采取特定的行动（即按时纳税）来保持其运营的合法性和财务健康，而不是限制它们不得做什么。 - c. 需要维持当前的业务线。同样，这要求发行人保持其现有的业务活动，这是对发行人采取正面行动的要求，而不是限制其行为。 总体而言，负面契约是关于禁止借款人进行某些可能损害债权人利益的行为，而肯定性契约则要求借款人必须执行某些行动，以确保其稳定经营和偿债能力。这是为什么在这个问题中选项b是正确答案，而a和c不是的原因。"},{"prompt":"will you please just take this String as an example and create a generale regexp to extract episode number ?Il.clandestino.S01E01.ITA.WEBDL.1080p.mp4 from this I just want E01 and even better 1","completion":"Yes, I can help you with that. For extracting the episode number in both formats \`E01\` and \`1\` from the string \`\\"Il.clandestino.S01E01.ITA.WEBDL.1080p.mp4\\"\`, we can use regular expressions (regex). Let's say the pattern for season and episode is somewhat standardized in the form of \`SxxExx\` where: - \`S\` indicates the season. - \`E\` indicates the episode. - \`xx\` represents numerical values. Here is a generic regular expression pattern you can use to match the season and episode format, and then extract just the episode number in the desired format. # 1. To extract \\"E01\\": \`\`\`regex E(d{2}) \`\`\` **Explanation:** - \`E\` matches the letter 'E' literally. - \`(d{2})\` captures exactly two digits following 'E'. # 2. To directly extract \\"1\\" (assuming episodes and seasons are not 0-padded when going above 9): If it’s possible that episodes are 0-padded digit like \`E01\` and you want to extract it as \`1\`, you could use a more sophisticated regex to strip the leading zero when there is one: \`\`\`regex E0?(d+) \`\`\` **Explanation:** - \`E0?\` matches the letter 'E' and an optional '0'. - \`(d+)\` captures one or more digits, ensuring you get the whole number including cases where the episode might be 10 or above. # Implementation Example in Python: Here's how you might use either of these regex patterns in Python to extract the desired episode number form: \`\`\`python import re # Example string input_str = \\"Il.clandestino.S01E01.ITA.WEBDL.1080p.mp4\\" # Regex to match \\"E01\\" match = re.search(\\"E(d{2})\\", input_str) if match: episode_with_e = match.group(0) # This will be 'E01' print(episode_with_e) # Output: E01 # Regex to match \\"1\\" match = re.search(\\"E0?(d+)\\", input_str) if match: episode_number = int(match.group(1)) # Convert to int to remove leading 0, if any. print(episode_number) # Output: 1 \`\`\` This approach will match the episode number in the desired format, removing any leading zeros when converting the string to an integer in the second example."},{"prompt":"Can you translate 4 ft. height and 3 ft. width into px?","completion":"The translation of dimensions in feet or any other physical unit into pixels (px) depends on desired or assumed resolution and the context in which these pixels are used. Pixels are digital units and don't have a direct correlation to physical units like feet without a specified resolution or pixel density (PPI - pixels per inch). To convert dimensions in feet to pixels, you need to know the resolution (PPI) you're aiming for. For example, if you're designing for a screen or printing at a certain quality, different PPI values might be used. Here’s how you can calculate it if you know the PPI (pixels per inch): 1. Convert feet to inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot). - For 4 feet height: 4 ft * 12 in/ft = 48 inches - For 3 feet width: 3 ft * 12 in/ft = 36 inches 2. If you know the PPI (say, 300 PPI for high-quality print), multiply each dimension in inches by the PPI to get the dimension in pixels. - Height in pixels: 48 in * 300 PPI = 14,400 pixels - Width in pixels: 36 in * 300 PPI = 10,800 pixels This means at 300 PPI, something that's 4 feet by 3 feet in the physical world would be 14,400 pixels by 10,800 pixels in digital form. Adjust the calculation according to your specific PPI. For web designs, a common screen resolution might be 72 PPI or 96 PPI, but for print, 300 PPI (or higher) is often used to ensure high quality."},{"prompt":"Please explain the following modified Garfield comic.

SFX: PAT PAT Jon {contently leaning next to Garfield}: Purrrr Garfield: And some professional help The author writes: Original strip: 1993-05-17.","completion":"The title \\"Shitpost #2: Garfield the Furry Hater\\" prepares the reader for a comic strip that has been altered in a way that is intended to be humorous, nonsensical, or deliberately provocative, fitting the internet slang term \\"shitpost.\\" This kind of content is known for being created more for the reaction or the amusement it causes rather than for adding substantive content. In the original Garfield comic strip from May 17, 1993, the humor comes from Garfield treating Jon, his owner, like a pet. This is established through Garfield's actions of petting Jon and Jon's contented reaction, culminating in the punchline where Garfield suggests Jon needs \\"some professional help,\\" implying that Jon's acceptance of this treatment is abnormal or concerning. The modified comic replaces the final punchline with \\"And some Pillen zur Fellkontrolle,\\" which translates from German to \\"And some fur control pills.\\" This alteration takes the joke in a different direction by maintaining the pretense that Jon is an animal needing pet care, adding a layer of absurdity by suggesting he needs a specific kind of pet care product typically not associated with humans. The humor in this version leans heavily on the absurdity and unexpectedness of the edited dialogue. The title's mention of \\"Garfield the Furry Hater\\" adds another layer of humor by implying that Garfield dislikes people who are furries (individuals interested in anthropomorphic animal characters, often dressing up as them), yet here he is, treating Jon as if he were a literal furry pet, needing \\"fur control pills.\\" This could be seen as an ironic twist, given the title's setup. Overall, the modified comic relies on the juxtaposition of the ordinary with the absurd and plays off internet culture's fondness for bizarre and unexpected humor. This kind of modification and humor is common in online communities where original content is reimagined in unexpected ways for comic effect."},{"prompt":"من داخل C# میخوام یک کلاس windows form بنویسم

Below is a script that you can add to your webpage to accomplish this. Ensure to place this script after the DOM elements or use it with a document ready event if you're using jQuery, to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before the script runs. This script adds a checkbox for showing/hiding the \\"company\\" and \\"vat_number\\" fields.

Waits for the DOM content to be fully loaded using \`DOMContentLoaded\`. 2. Creates a checkbox and places it at the beginning of the form section (or wherever you find most appropriate). 3. Finds the fields for \\"company\\" and \\"vat_number\\" and initially hides them. 4. Sets up an event listener on the checkbox that toggles the visibility of these fields based on whether the checkbox is checked or not.

The issuer is: a. required to pay taxes as they come due. b. prohibited from investing in risky projects. c. required to maintain its current lines of business.多项选择题并解释一下每一项","completion":"Negative bond covenants are conditions or clauses in a bond agreement that prohibit the issuer from undertaking certain actions that could potentially harm the interests of the bondholders. The aim is to protect the bondholders by ensuring the issuer maintains a certain level of financial stability and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize the issuer's ability to make interest payments or repay the principal. Let's analyze the options given: a. **Required to pay taxes as they come due.** - This statement does not typically represent a negative covenant. Instead, it is an example of a positive covenant. Positive covenants are assurances that the bond issuer must perform certain activities, such as paying taxes, maintaining insurance, or upkeeping assets. Ensuring taxes are paid is a basic operational expectation and while important, it's more about maintaining normal business operations rather than restricting the company's actions. b. **Prohibited from investing in risky projects.** - This statement best describes a negative covenant. Negative covenants often restrict the issuer from taking on additional debt, paying dividends beyond a certain amount, selling key assets, or making significant investments that could jeopardize the company's financial health or alter its risk profile. Prohibiting investments in risky projects is aimed directly at protecting bondholders by preventing the issuer from engaging in activities that could diminish its ability to meet its liabilities. c. **Required to maintain its current lines of business.** - This statement, while it seems restrictive, doesn't typically fall under the definition of a negative covenant. It might be considered restrictive in nature but is more about ensuring the issuer doesn't diversify or pivot in a way that could harm its stable income streams. However, in a broader context, this could be seen as an effort to prevent the issuer from engaging in drastically different business activities that could affect its financial stability, thereby indirectly protecting the bondholders. Such a covenant, depending on how it's framed, could be seen as either positive (mandating what the company must do: stick to its business) or negative by implying a restriction on altering business focus. So, from the options provided, **b. Prohibited from investing in risky projects** is the one that best describes a negative bond covenant. Negative covenants are about limiting or restricting certain actions to protect bondholders, and prohibiting investments in risky projects is a direct means of maintaining the financial stability of the issuer, safeguarding the issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations to bondholders."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\".ASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по алгебре в 8 классе на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения”<br/><br/>Дата проведения урока: [указать дату]<br/><br/>Цели урока:<br/>1.

Самоанализ напиши в произвольном видеASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по алгебре в 8 классе на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения”<br/><br/>Проведение урока по данной теме явилось для меня не только возможностью попрактиковаться в роли учителя, но и проверить насколько успешно я могу передать учащимся знания по интересующей их теме. Урок был спланирован с учетом возрастных особенностей восьмиклассников, их интересов и предпочтений в методах обучения.<br/><br/>В начале урока мной были заложены цели не только усвоения конкретных знаний о неполных квадратных уравнениях, но и развития логического мышления, а также умения анализировать и строить выводы. Я стремился создать дружелюбную атмосферу, чтобы учащиеся не боялись высказываться и демонстрировать свои знания и сомнения.<br/><br/>Методически урок был построен так, что начался с повторения уже известных фактов о квадратных уравнениях. Это позволило сгладить переход к новой теме. После чего был представлен и разобран новый материал, где я использовал презентацию с наглядными примерами неполных квадратных уравнений и методов их решения.<br/><br/>Большую часть урока я посвятил практике: решению задач вместе с классом и работе учеников в группах и индивидуально. Это позволило мне лучше понять уровень усвоения материала каждым учеником и вовремя предоставить обратную связь или дополнительную помощь тем, кто испытывал трудности.<br/><br/>Однако, в ходе урока я заметил, что некоторым учащимся было сложно сосредоточиться, что, возможно, было вызвано монотонностью моих объяснений. В будущем мне стоит внедрить больше интерактивных и игровых форм работы, чтобы повысить вовлеченность и активность всех учеников.<br/><br/>Также я почувствовал необходимость разнообразить дидактические материалы и задания, делая их более доступными и интересными для разных категорий учеников. Важным аспектом, который я извлек из этого опыта, является понимание того, что поддержка и поощрение со стороны учителя играют большую роль в мотивации учеников.<br/><br/>В конце урока я провел рефлексию, позволив учащимся выразить свое мнение о полученных знаниях и процессе обучения, что дало мне дополнительную обратную связь и понимание того, какие аспекты моего преподавания мне следует улучшить в будущем.<br/><br/>В заключение, хотя урок и был не лишен недостатков, я считаю его ценным опытом, который показал мне направления для дальнейшего профессионального и личностного роста как педагога.USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT: Самоанализ моего урока по алгебре на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения” для 8 класса стал значимым этапом в практике преподавания. Этот опыт позволил мне не только применить теоретические знания, полученные в университете, но и понять глубину своей ответственности как учителя за образовательный процесс.<br/><br/>Основная цель урока – ознакомить учащихся с неполными квадратными уравнениями и научить их успешно решать такие уравнения. Я постарался сделать урок максимально интерактивным и насыщенным, используя презентацию с визуальными примерами и групповую работу, чтобы способствовать лучшему восприятию и усвоению информации учащимися.<br/><br/>В качестве одной из ключевых методик обучения я включил решение задач на доске и работу в парах, что, как мне казалось, должно было способствовать лучшему усвоению материала. Мне удалось охватить различные виды неполных квадратных уравнений, постаравшись обеспечить наиболее ясное понимание методов их решения.<br/><br/>Однако, несмотря на мои усилия, во время урока я столкнулся с рядом сложностей. Некоторые ученики испытывали проблемы с концентрацией внимания и не могли полностью сосредоточиться на изложенном материале. Возможно, это было связано с недостаточным использованием игровых элементов и недостаточно четкой структурированностью урока для удержания внимания учащихся.<br/><br/>Также я заметил, что наличие однотипных заданий вызвало у некоторых учеников скуку, что показывает мне необходимость более тщательного подбора и дифференциации заданий в зависимости от интересов и уровня подготовки каждого ученика.<br/><br/>В заключение, этот опыт учебного урока показал мне важность гибкости и адаптивности в подходах к преподаванию. В дальнейшем я планирую использовать разнообразные методы обучения и контроля, более активно вовлекать учащихся в учебный процесс и уделять больше внимания индивидуальным особенностям и потребностям студентов. Этот урок стал важным уроком и для меня лично, подчеркнув необходимость постоянного самосовершенствования в роли учителя.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по физике 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления. Электрическое сопротивление проводника\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по физике в 8 классе на тему “Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления. Электрическое сопротивление проводника”<br/><br/><br/>Подготовка и проведение урока по этой теме стали для меня важным испытанием моих педагогических и профессиональных навыков. Задача состояла не просто в изложении теоретического материала, но и в том, чтобы сделать урок понятным и интересным для восьмиклассников, с учетом их возрастных особенностей и предварительных знаний.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Урок начался с краткого повторения предыдущих тем по электричеству, чтобы обеспечить плавный переход к новому материалу. Введение в тему “Электрическое сопротивление проводника” было оформлено в форме презентации с визуальными иллюстрациями, которые помогли проиллюстрировать ключевые понятия.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Особое внимание я уделила практическим заданиям и экспериментам, которые позволили учащимся самостоятельно наблюдать зависимость силы тока от сопротивления в цепи. Это придало уроку интерактивность и способствовало лучшему усвоению материала. При реализации этой части урока я столкнулась с тем, что не все ученики могли активно участвовать в эксперименте одновременно, что показало мне значимость более тщательного планирования групповых и индивидуальных заданий.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В ходе урока я также обнаружила, что понятие “сопротивление” оказалось сложным для понимания некоторыми учениками.

Поскольку плоскость ориентирована в направлении вектора (vec{k}), поток будет равен интегралу компоненты векторного поля в направлении (vec{k}) по заданной области.<br/><br/>В данной задаче нас интересует третья компонента векторного поля, потому что она соответствует направлению (vec{k}), то есть (F_k = z^2 + x^2). Однако, поскольку интегрирование происходит через плоскость Oxy, значение (z) на этой плоскости равно 0, и тогда (F_k = x^2).<br/><br/>Таким образом, поток векторного поля через заданную поверхность равен:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = iint limits_{S} vec{F} cdot dvec{S} = iint limits_{S} (x^2 + y^2) dz = iint limits_{D} x^2 , dA<br/>]<br/><br/>Где (D) — это проекция интересующей нас области на плоскость Oxy, которая в данном случае представляет собой круг радиусом 1 с центром в начале координат.<br/><br/>Переходим к полярным координатам для удобства вычисления интеграла:<br/><br/>[<br/>x^2 = r^2 cos^2(theta), quad dA = r, dr, dtheta<br/>]<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = int limits_{0}^{2pi} int limits_{0}^{1} r^3 cos^2(theta) , dr , dtheta<br/>]<br/><br/>Вычисляем интегралы последовательно:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = int limits_{0}^{2pi} cos^2(theta) , dtheta int limits_{0}^{1} r^3 , dr = left( int limits_{0}^{2pi} frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} dtheta right) left( frac{r^4}{4} Big|<em>{0}^{1} right)<br/>]<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi_1 = frac{1}{4} left[ left( frac{1}{2} theta + frac{1}{4} sin(2theta) right) Bigg|</em>{0}^{2pi}right] times 1^4 = frac{1}{4} left[ pi right] = frac{pi}{4}<br/>]<br/><br/>Таким образом, поток векторного поля (vec{a}) через данную поверхность равен (frac{pi}{4}).USER: Вычислить поток векторного поля в цилиндрической системе координат а=(х²+у²) I+(y²+z²) j+(z²+x²)k через часть плоскости Оху, ограниченную окружностью x²+y²=1 (в направлении вектора k)ASSISTANT: Для вычисления потока векторного поля (vec{a} = (x^2 + y^2) hat{i} + (y^2 + z^2) hat{j} + (z^2 + x^2) hat{k}) через часть плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1) (в направлении вектора (hat{k})), необходимо рассчитать поверхностный интеграл второго рода для компоненты (hat{k}) векторного поля.<br/><br/>Рассматриваемая область находится на плоскости Oxy, где (z = 0), поэтому компонента векторного поля, ориентированного в направлении (hat{k}), упрощается до (z^2 + x^2). При (z = 0) это выражение упрощается до (x^2).<br/><br/>Поверхностный интеграл для этой компоненты векторного поля по заданной области на плоскости Oxy может быть выражен как:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = iintlimits_{S} (z^2 + x^2) , dS<br/>]<br/><br/>При (z = 0), выражение для потока через плоскость Oxy принимает вид:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = iintlimits_{D} x^2 , dA<br/>]<br/><br/>где (D) обозначает область на плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1).<br/><br/>Для выполнения интеграции удобно перейти к полярным координатам, где (dA = r , dr , dtheta), и (x = r cos(theta)). Таким образом, интеграл преобразуется к виду:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = int_{0}^{2pi} int_{0}^{1} (r^2 cos^2(theta))r , dr , dtheta<br/>]<br/><br/>Выполнение интеграции по (r) дает:<br/><br/>[<br/>int_{0}^{1} r^3 , dr = frac{1}{4}r^4 Big|<em>0^1 = frac{1}{4}<br/>]<br/><br/>Тогда:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = frac{1}{4} int</em>{0}^{2pi} cos^2(theta) , dtheta<br/>]<br/><br/>Используя тригонометрическую идентичность (cos^2(theta) = frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2}), интеграл по (theta) равен:<br/><br/>[<br/>int_{0}^{2pi} frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} , dtheta = pi<br/>]<br/><br/>Следовательно, поток (vec{a}) через часть плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1), равен<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = frac{pi}{4} times pi = frac{pi^2}{4}<br/>]<br/><br/>Таким образом, поток векторного поля через заданную поверхность равен (frac{pi^2}{4}).USER: Расшифруй все значения в решении задачиASSISTANT: Давайте расшифруем и подробно разберем приведенное решение задачи по вычислению потока векторного поля (vec{a} = (x^2 + y^2) hat{i} + (y^2 + z^2) hat{j} + (z^2 + x^2) hat{k}) через часть плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1), в направлении вектора (hat{k}).<br/><br/>1. <strong>Задача</strong>: Нужно найти поток векторного поля (vec{a}) через заданную плоскость в направлении вектора (hat{k}), то есть оси (z).<br/><br/>2. <strong>Упрощение задачи</strong>: Так как интегрирование происходит через плоскость Oxy, где (z = 0), компонента векторного поля, ориентированного в направлении (hat{k}), упрощается до (z^2 + x^2). При (z = 0), остается только (x^2).<br/><br/>3. <strong>Вывод формулы для потока</strong>: Поток векторного поля через поверхность выражается как поверхностный интеграл:<br/> [Phi = iintlimits_{D} x^2 , dA]<br/> Где (D) — проекция интересующей области, то есть круг радиуса 1 в плоскости Oxy.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Переход к полярным координатам</strong>: В полярных координатах (x = r cos(theta)), а площадь элемента (dA) выражается через (r dr dtheta). Таким образом, интеграл принимает вид:<br/> [Phi = int_{0}^{2pi} int_{0}^{1} r^3 cos^2(theta) dr dtheta]<br/><br/>5. <strong>Вычисление интеграла</strong>:<br/> - Интегрирование по (r) дает (frac{1}{4} r^4) от 0 до 1, что равно (frac{1}{4}).<br/> - Интегрирование по (theta) требует использования тригонометрической идентичности (cos^2(theta) = frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2}). Интеграл (int_{0}^{2pi} frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} dtheta) равен (pi), так как антипроизводная от (frac{1}{2}) дает (frac{theta}{2}), а от (frac{cos(2theta)}{2}) — (frac{sin(2theta)}{4}), которая равна нулю на границах от 0 до (2pi).<br/><br/>6. <strong>Итоговый расчет потока</strong>: Поток векторного поля равен (frac{pi}{4} times pi = frac{pi^2}{4}).<br/><br/>Таким образом, во всей задаче:<br/>- Использование полярных координат позволило упростить интеграцию по области круга.<br/>- Упрощение компоненты векторного поля до (x^2) было обусловлено интегрированием по плоскости Oxy.<br/>- Интеграл по (theta) решался с помощью стандартной тригонометрической идентичности для (cos^2(theta)).<br/>- Результат — поток векторного поля через указанную поверхность — равен (frac{pi^2}{4}).USER: Что такое int в решении этой задачиASSISTANT: В решении этой задачи символ “int” обозначает операцию взятия интеграла. Интегрирование — это математическая операция, позволяющая найти интеграл функции. Интеграл представляет собой обобщение понятия суммирования бесконечного числа бесконечно малых величин и используется для вычисления площадей, объёмов, значения средней функции на интервале и многих других задач.<br/><br/>В контексте этой задачи нахождение интеграла позволяет рассчитать поток векторного поля через заданную поверхность. Интеграл бывает определенным и неопределенным:<br/>- <strong>Неопределенный интеграл</strong> функции представляет собой семейство всех первообразных данной функции.<br/>- <strong>Определенный интеграл</strong> функции на интервале [a, b] позволяет вычислить “сумму” значений функции с учётом знака на заданном интервале, что можно интерпретировать как площадь между графиком функции и осью абсцисс на данном отрезке.<br/><br/>В выражении (int_{0}^{2pi} int_{0}^{1} r^3 cos^2(theta) , dr , dtheta),<br/>- Первый интеграл (int_{0}^{1} r^3 , dr) — это операция взятия интеграла по радиусу (r) от 0 до 1, позволяющая найти объём подготовленный функцией в полярной системе координат.<br/>- Второй интеграл (int_{0}^{2pi} cos^2(theta) , dtheta) — это операция взятия интеграла по углу (theta) от 0 до (2pi), обычно используемая для расчета полного вращения вокруг начала координат в полярной системе координат.<br/><br/>Оба интеграла, будучи рассчитанными, позволяют определить общий поток векторного поля через заданную плоскость.USER: Объясни что значит в этой задаче выражение [phi=iintlimits_{D}x², dA]ASSISTANT: В этой задаче выражение (Phi = iintlimits_{D} x^2 , dA) описывает процесс вычисления потока векторного поля через заданную поверхность. Давайте разберем, что каждый символ и операция означают в данном контексте:<br/><br/>- (Phi) обозначает поток векторного поля через интересующую нас поверхность. В общем, поток векторного поля через поверхность это мера того, сколько данного поля “протекает” через эту поверхность.<br/><br/>- Двойной интеграл (iintlimits_{D}) указывает на операцию интегрирования по двумерной области (D), которая в данном случае ограничена окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1) на плоскости (Oxy). Этот двойной интеграл позволяет нам учитывать всех точек внутри круга радиуса 1.<br/><br/>- (x^2) — это функция, которую интегрируем. В контексте задачи, это третья компонента векторного поля (vec{a}), соответствующая направлению вектора (k), после учета факта, что интегрирование происходит через плоскость (Oxy), где (z = 0), и поэтому (x^2) представляет вклад компоненты векторного поля в направлении оси (z).<br/><br/>- (dA) обозначает элементарную площадь на плоскости (Oxy), по которой ведется интегрирование. При использовании полярных координат, как обычно делается для таких задач, (dA) принимается как (r dr dtheta), где (r) и (theta) — полярные координаты, соответствующие радиальному расстоянию от центра и углу поворота соответственно.<br/><br/>Следовательно, выражение (Phi = iintlimits_{D} x^2 , dA) задает расчет потока векторного поля, который осуществляется путем интегрирования квадрата (x)-компоненты векторного поля по площади круга радиуса 1 в плоскости (Oxy). Этот поток дает нам количественную меру того, как часть векторного поля, ориентированная вдоль оси (z), “проходит” через круглую область на плоскости (Oxy).USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, проводишь фрагмент урока по математике.

Marlene goes back to her cigarette, puffing away the tension, while George returns to his newspaper, shaking his head in disbelief at the unforeseen turn of events that just unfolded in their living room. The scene fades with the hum of family life returning to normalcy, albeit a quirky, unpredictable sort of normal that seems to define this household perfectly. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"влияет ли как то гвоздика на щитовидную железу?","completion":"Гвоздика – это ароматная специя с пряным вкусом и множеством полезных свойств, которая используется в кулинарии и медицине. Она богата антиоксидантами и содержит витамины и минералы, полезные для организма. При этом, вопрос о воздействии гвоздики на работу щитовидной железы является достаточно специфическим и требует детального рассмотрения. Гвоздика может оказывать некоторое воздействие на щитовидную железу, но это зависит от индивидуальных особенностей организма и состояния здоровья человека. Положительные аспекты включают ее антиоксидантные свойства, которые потенциально могут поддерживать общую функцию щитовидной железы. Антиоксиданты помогают бороться с окислительным стрессом, который может негативно сказываться на здоровье щитовидной железы. С другой стороны, у некоторых людей могут наблюдаться определенные реакции на употребление определенных видов специй, включая гвоздику, особенно если есть склонность к аллергиям или другие специфические заболевания щитовидной железы, как аутоиммунные заболевания (например, болезнь Грейвса или аутоиммунный тиреоидит). В таких случаях потребление гвоздики в больших количествах может повлиять на симптомы заболевания или общее состояние. Однако, научных исследований, прямо указывающих на влияние гвоздики на функцию щитовидной железы, на мой последний срок обновления информации (2023 год), недостаточно. Большинство исследований касается общих противовоспалительных и антиоксидантных свойств гвоздики. При наличии проблем с щитовидной железой или если есть опасения относительно воздействия гвоздики на здоровье, рекомендуется консультироваться с врачом или эндокринологом. Это позволит получить индивидуальную профессиональную рекомендацию в соответствии с вашим состоянием здоровья и потребностями."},{"prompt":"влияют ли гормоны щитовидной железы на скорость перестатики кишечника?","completion":"Да, гормоны щитовидной железы действительно влияют на скорость перистальтики кишечника. Щитовидная железа вырабатывает гормоны тироксин (T4) и трийодтиронин (T3), которые играют ключевую роль в регулировании обмена веществ в организме, включая метаболизм в пищеварительной системе. При гипотиреозе, когда щитовидная железа производит недостаточное количество гормонов, может замедляться обмен веществ, что в свою очередь приводит к замедлению перистальтики кишечника. Это может вызвать запоры и другие расстройства пищеварения. Также у пациентов с гипотиреозом могут наблюдаться другие симптомы, такие как увеличение веса, усталость, чувствительность к холоду и др. С другой стороны, при гипертиреозе, когда вырабатывается избыточное количество гормонов щитовидной железы, скорость обмена веществ увеличивается. Это может привести к учащению стула или диарее, так как перистальтика кишечника ускоряется. Кроме изменений в работе кишечника, при гипертиреозе могут проявляться такие симптомы, как потеря веса, учащенное сердцебиение, повышенная потливость, нервозность и т.д. Таким образом, состояние щитовидной железы и уровень её гормонов оказывают значительное влияние на работу пищеварительной системы и скорость перистальтики кишечника. При возникновении проблем с пищеварением и подозрении на нарушения функции щитовидной железы необходимо обратиться к врачу для проведения обследования и получения соответствующего лечения."},{"prompt":"какими лекарствами при гипертериозе решают проблему с диареей и слишком частым стулом?","completion":"При гипертиреозе учащенный стул и диарея могут быть результатом ускоренного метаболизма и повышенной активности перистальтики кишечника. Лечение в таких случаях направлено в первую очередь на стабилизацию уровней гормонов щитовидной железы, поскольку именно дисбаланс этих гормонов обычно вызывает указанные симптомы. Однако существуют препараты и методы, которые могут быть использованы для облегчения симптомов диареи и учащенного стула при гипертиреозе: 1. **Антитиреоидные препараты**: Метимазол (Тиамазол) или Пропилтиоурацил используются для уменьшения производства щитовидными гормонами. Контроль над уровнем гормонов может помочь устранить проблемы с кишечником. 2. **Бета-блокаторы**: Препараты вроде пропранолола могут быть назначены для уменьшения симптомов гипертиреоза, таких как учащенное сердцебиение, тревожность и тремор. Они не воздействуют напрямую на учащенный стул, но общее улучшение состояния может позитивно отразиться на работе кишечника. 3. **Лекарства от диареи**: Препараты, такие как Лоперамид (Имодиум), помогают замедлить работу кишечника и уменьшить количество жидких стулов. Однако эти препараты следует использовать с осторожностью и только по назначению врача, поскольку они лишь симптоматически влияют на диарею, не устраняя ее причину. 4. **Диета**: Иногда коррекция питания может помочь управлять симптомами. Следует избегать продуктов, которые могут вызывать или усиливать диарею, таких как острая, жирная пища и кофе. 5. **Восстановление баланса жидкости и электролитов**: Диарея может привести к обезвоживанию и потере электролитов. Рекомендуется пить достаточное количество жидкости и, при необходимости, использовать растворы для оральной регидратации. Важно помнить, что самолечение может быть опасным. Перед началом приема любых препаратов обязательно консультироваться с врачом. Специалист подберет индивидуальную терапию, исходя из общего состояния здоровья, степени выраженности гипертиреоза и сопутствующих заболеваний."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],G={key:0},z={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
