This is because the maximum value in ( S_i ) is less than twice the minimum value in ( S_i ). - Therefore, ( bc < 2a cdot a = 2a^2 ).

Let us consider the product of any pair of numbers ( (a, b) ) from the given set of 48 natural numbers. 2. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers raised to some power. We denote the product of such a pair as: [ ab = K^2 cdot p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_k, ] where ( K ) is a natural number, and ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are distinct primes. This means ( ab ) can be written as the product of a square of some number ( K ) and some primes each raised to the first power (this representation is possible as the union of the prime factors of ( a ) and ( b ) will also be a product of primes). 3. The problem states that the product of some 48 natural numbers has exactly 10 different prime divisors. 4.

For a rectangular parallelepiped (a 3D rectangle), this projection can take several different forms depending on its orientation. 2. **Identification of the Projection**: The projection of the rectangular parallelepiped onto a plane can be represented as a parallelogram (or a quadrilateral). When projected onto the horizontal plane, the shape obtained is a rectangle if the parallelepiped is aligned properly. 3. **Maximization of the Area**: To achieve the maximum area of the projection, we need to ensure that the plane of the rectangular face of the parallelepiped is parallel to the horizontal plane. 4. **Mathematical Verification**: Consider a triangular section ABC in the parallelepiped, and its projection onto the plane. The area S_{triangle ABC} of the triangle in the projection plane is related to the area of the original triangle S_{triangle A'B'C'} inside the parallelepiped through the cosine of the angle alpha between the triangle and the projection plane.

If there are no sixes in the first salvo, then in the second salvo all ( n ) dice are involved again: [ xi_n = 1 + eta_n = 1 + I_0 eta_n ] 3. If the first salvo results in one six, then in the second salvo, ( n - 1 ) dice are involved: [ xi_n = 1 + eta_{n-1} = 1 + I_1 eta_{n-1} ] 4.

We reflect point S symmetrically with respect to point O. Let the resulting point be P. 3. We need to prove that point P is also a center of symmetry. Let A be an arbitrary point of the figure. 4. Since O is a center of symmetry, the point A_1, which is symmetric to A with respect to O, also belongs to the figure. 5. Reflect the point A_1 symmetrically with respect to S to obtain point A_2. Since S is a center of symmetry, A_2 also belongs to the figure. 6. Reflect the point A_2 symmetrically with respect to O again to obtain point A_3: - The segment AP is equal and parallel to SA_1. - A_2 is on the figure and symmetrical with respect to S. - On the other hand, the segment PA_3 is equal and parallel to A_2S. 7.

Thus, the leader has 6 points. - The remaining 9 players would then have collectively (30 - 6 = 24) points among them. 5. **Minimum Points Calculation for Other Players**: - Since the remaining 24 points are distributed among 9 players, at least one of them must have a minimum of (lceil frac{24}{9} rceil = 3) points. - The leader with 6 points can at most have 3 points more than any of the other players after these 6 rounds. 6. **Determining the Number of Rounds for an Uncontested Winner**: - Consider 7 rounds instead of 6. If the leader continues to win, they would have 7 points. - Suppose all other matches end in draws (0.5 points each split), each of the remaining 9 players would gather some points depending on the pairwise draws. 7. **Scenario After 7 Rounds**: - Leader: 7 points (winning all 7 matches). - Remaining 3 matches involve other players splitting points or winning. - If the leader has won 7 games, and assuming all other possible matches end in draws, two other players, having not played against the leader, might have scores as follows: - Each drawing all other games could have ((7-1) times 0.5 = 3.5) points from draws and no additional wins. 8. **Final Consideration**: - So after 7 rounds, no player can match or exceed the 7 points of the leader despite the remaining rounds. 9. **Conclusion**: - This analysis confirms that 7 rounds are the minimum required for a definitive, uncontested winner to be determined in such a tournament.

Denote by ( d(n) ) the number of positive divisors of ( n ). Thus, we seek ( n ) such that: [ n = 100 cdot d(n) ] Let's start by introducing some notations: - Let ( p triangleright n ) denote the exponent of the prime ( p ) in the canonical factorization of ( n ). - Let ( delta(n) = frac{n}{d(n)} ). The reformulated problem asks us to find all ( n ) such that: [ delta(n) = 100 ] We begin by stating a useful lemma. **Lemma:** Let ( n ) be an integer and ( m ) its proper divisor. Then ( delta(m) leq delta(n) ), with equality if and only if ( m ) is odd and ( n = 2m ). **Proof of Lemma:** Consider ( n = mp ) for some prime ( p ). By the well-known formula for the number of divisors: [ d(n) = prod_{pmid n} (1 + p triangleright n) ] we have: [ frac{delta(n)}{delta(m)} = frac{n}{m} cdot frac{d(m)}{d(n)} = p cdot frac{1 + p triangleright m}{1 + p triangleright n} ] To simplify, use ( p triangleright n = p triangleright m + 1 ): [ frac{delta(n)}{delta(m)} = p cdot frac{p triangleright n}{1 + p triangleright n} geq 2 cdot frac{1}{2} = 1 ] Hence: [ delta(m) leq delta(n) ] Equality holds if and only if ( p = 2 ) and ( p triangleright n = 1 ), i.e., ( m ) is odd and ( n = 2m ). Next, assume ( delta(n) = 100 ). Thus: [ n = 100 cdot d(n) = 2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot d(n) ] We estimate the exponents of primes in the canonical representation of ( n ), knowing ( delta(n) = 100 ): 1. **Case of prime 2:** [ delta(2^7 cdot 5^2) = frac{2^7 cdot 5^2}{d(2^7 cdot 5^2)} = frac{2^7 cdot 5^2}{8 cdot 3} = frac{3200}{24} > 100 ] Hence, ( 2 triangleright n leq 6 ). 2. **Case of prime 5:** [ delta(2^2 cdot 5^4) = frac{2^2 cdot 5^4}{d(2^2 cdot 5^4)} = frac{2^2 cdot 5^4}{3 cdot 5} = frac{2500}{15} > 100 ] Hence, ( 5 triangleright n leq 3 ). 3. **Case of prime 3:** [ delta(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^4) = frac{2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^4}{d(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^4)} = frac{2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^4}{3 cdot 3 cdot 5} = frac{8100}{45} > 100 ] Hence, ( 3 triangleright n leq 3 ). 4. **For any prime ( q > 5 ):** Let ( q ) be any prime greater than 5 and ( k geq 4 ): [ begin{aligned} delta(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot q^k) & = frac{2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot q^k}{d(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot q^k)} = frac{2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot q^k}{d(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^k)} & > frac{2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^k}{d(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^k)} = delta(2^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 3^k) > 100 end{aligned} ] Hence, ( q triangleright n leq 3 ). 5. **Primes greater than 7:** For a prime ( q > 7 ) dividing ( n ): Since ( n ) cannot have a divisor involving ( q^k ), primes ( q > 7 ) do not divide ( n ). Thus such primes do not appear in ( n ). 6. **For prime 7:** Assume 7 divides ( n ). Then ( 7 ) divides ( d(n) ): [ delta(2^6 cdot 5^2 cdot 7) = frac{2^6 cdot 5^2 cdot 7}{d(2^6 cdot 5^2 cdot 7)} = frac{2^4 cdot 7 cdot 100}{7 cdot 3 cdot 2} = frac{11200}{42} > 100 ] So, ( n neq 7 ) and ( 2 triangleright n leq 5 ). 7. **Conclusion when ( 5 triangleright n = 3 ):** [ delta(2^4 cdot 5^3) = frac{2^4 cdot 5^3}{d(2^4 cdot 5^3)} = frac{2^2 cdot 5 cdot 100}{5 cdot 4} = 100 ] Thus, ( n = 2^4 cdot 5^3 = 2000 ), meeting the condition. Any ( n neq 2000 ) with the same prime factorization would give ( delta(n) > 100 ). 8. **For ( 5 triangleright n = 2 ):** Possible ( 2 triangleright n ) are: [ 2 triangleright n in {2, 3, 5} ] Considering ( 3 triangleright n ): - (3 triangleright n = 3) forces contradictions as shown, leaving: - ( 2 triangleright n = 4 ) and ( 5 triangleright n = 3 ), leading back to ( n = 2000 ).

Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Initial Assumption**: We are given a tournament structure where each participant faces every other participant exactly once in a paired match (two teams of two participants each). 2. **Combinatorial Condition**: Each participant must have matches against all other (n-1) participants, and all possible pairs of opponents are grouped into foursomes. 3. **Pair Analysis**: Since the opponents of a particular participant can be divided into pairs, ( n ) must be odd. This is needed to ensure that each player pairs with the remainder of the participants in a uniform match. 4. **Counting Matches**: Calculating the total number of matches requires considering the combinations of pairs: [ text{Total pairs} = frac{1}{2} n(n-1) ] Here, each unique pair of participants plays exactly once, and thus, there are (frac{1}{2} n(n-1)) total different matches. 5. **Grouping in Foursomes**: Since the pairs are matched in sets of four (each pair playing against another pair directly), the total number of matches must be divisible by 4: [ frac{1}{2} n(n-1) equiv 0 pmod{4} ] 6. **Divisibility Condition**: Simplifying the above modulus condition: [ n(n-1) text{ must be divisible by } 8 ] This means ( n-1 ) must be a multiple of 8: [ n-1 = 8k quad text{for some integer } k ] This gives: [ n = 8k + 1 ] 7. **Existence of Such Tournaments**: To verify the existence of such a tournament structure for ( n = 8k + 1): - When ( k = 1 ), ( n = 9 ), we associate the players with vertices of a nonagon and showcase one possible valid configuration of matches. - For larger ( k ), we follow an inductive approach by constructing sub-tournaments for each set of 8 participants and then combining the results with additional players. 8. **Organizing Larger Sets**: For any ( k > 1 ), selecting one player out of ( 8k + 1 ) and arranging the remaining participants into ( k ) groups of 8 players each, each subgroup can be handled using the same logic as the ( k = 1 ) case. Combining these groups with additional intergroup matches ensures every participant has correctly faced all others exactly once. # Conclusion: Therefore, the number ( n ) of participants for which such a tournament structure is possible is given by: [ n = 8k + 1 quad text{where } k in mathbb{N} ] [ boxed{n = 8k + 1} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, points D and E are on the extensions of AC and AB respectively, in the same direction.

Since the class is made up of male and female students only, we have: M + F = 100% (1) Now, let's denote the probability that a randomly selected student is male and less than 25 years old as P(M<25), and the probability that a randomly selected student is female and less than 25 years old as P(F<25). Given that 50% of the male students are 25 years old or older, the probability that a male student is less than 25 years old is 100% - 50% = 50%. Therefore, P(M<25) = 0.5 * M. Similarly, given that 40% of the female students are 25 years old or older, the probability that a female student is less than 25 years old is 100% - 40% = 60%. Therefore, P(F<25) = 0.6 * F. The overall probability that a randomly selected student is less than 25 years old is the sum of the probabilities for male and female students: P(<25) = P(M<25) + P(F<25) 0.56 = 0.5 * M + 0.6 * F Using equation (1), we can express F in terms of M: F = 100% - M Now we can substitute F in the equation for P(<25): 0.56 = 0.5 * M + 0.6 * (100% - M) 0.56 = 0.5 * M + 60% - 0.6 * M 0.56 = 60% - 0.1 * M Now we can solve for M: 0.1 * M = 60% - 0.56 0.1 * M = 0.04 M = 0.04 / 0.1 M = 0.4 So the percentage of male students in the class is boxed{40%} ."},{"prompt":"Square EFGH has its center at (10, 6) and has an area of 16 square units.

If Dormouse initially drank from a red cup, after each turn of the table, two red cups would be emptied. Since there are 15 red cups and 15 blue cups, if they were drinking from the same-colored cups, at the end, two cups of different colors would remain, which could not both be placed in front of the drinkers by any rotation of the table. 5. Consequently, Dormouse must have started with a blue cup. This ensures that each step of the rotation would present a full cup of the opposite color to each drinker. 6.

The solution uses a coloring strategy similar to a checkerboard pattern, where we alternate black and white squares. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Notation and Initial Assumptions**: - Let ( n = 2m ). - Color the ( n times n ) board in a checkerboard fashion, so that half the squares are black and the other half are white. 2. **Goal**: - We need to find the minimum number of squares to mark (let's assume we mark white squares) so that each black square is adjacent to at least one marked (white) square. 3. **Marking the Squares**: - By looking at the diagonals of the board, we can see that each diagonal alternates in color. Specifically, the odd-length diagonals will contain an alternating pattern of black and white squares. - We mark alternate squares in every other odd-length white diagonal. Let’s break this down: 4. **Number of Marks on Odd-Length Diagonals**: - Consider a diagonal of length ( 2r+1 ). Since we're marking alternate squares starting from the border in each such diagonal, the number of squares marked in a diagonal of length ( 2r+1 ) is ( r+1 ). This ensures that each black square in the adjacent diagonal is covered because diagonals are adjacent. 5. **Counting the Marked Squares**: - The total number of marked squares is the sum of the series: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + (2m - 1) ] - We can rearrange these terms equivalently as: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + m ] - The sum of the first ( m ) terms is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: [ sum_{k=1}^{m} k = frac{m(m+1)}{2} ] 6. **Proof of Sufficiency**: - This number ensures that all black squares have at least one adjacent marked white square, fulfilling the condition stated in the problem. 7. **Proof of Necessity**: - For clarity, consider the alternate odd-length black diagonals. Just as each marked white square covers two adjacent black squares, each unmarked black diagonal ensures that we need to mark an alternate white diagonal. - Therefore, the minimum number of white squares that must be marked is: [ frac{m(m+1)}{2} ] 8. **Final Calculation**: - Substituting ( m = frac{n}{2} ), we get: [ frac{frac{n}{2} left( frac{n}{2} + 1 right)}{2} = frac{n(n+2)}{4} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of squares that need to be marked on an ( n times n ) board is: [ boxed{frac{n(n+2)}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that ( n ) is a positive integer, the real number ( x ) satisfies |1 | 2 |3 cdots |(n1) |n x||cdots||| = x.

This operation shifts the mean by c, but the differences (x_i - mu) are unaffected because both the data points and the mean are increased by the same amount.

We can substitute this into the equation: (4C * 19 + C * 9) / (4C + C) = x Simplify the equation: (76C + 9C) / (5C) = x 85C / 5C = x 17 = x So, the specific gravity of the alloy should be 17 times as heavy as water. The ratio in which gold and copper should be mixed to achieve this specific gravity is boxed{4:1} (gold to copper)."},{"prompt":"The set of real numbers x that satisfy the inequality |xA| < B (B > 0, A in mathbb{R}) is called the Bneighborhood of A.

Thus, frac{1}{a} + frac{4}{b} = frac{1}{2-b} + frac{4}{b}, Let f(x) = frac{1}{2-x} + frac{4}{x}, where x neq 0 and x neq 2 Therefore, f'(x) = frac{1}{(x-2)^2} - frac{4}{x^2} = frac{-(x-4)(3x-4)}{(x-2)^2x^2} When f'(x) > 0, we solve to get frac{4}{3} < x < 4, and x neq 2, When f'(x) < 0, we solve to get x < frac{4}{3} or x > 4, and x neq 0, Therefore, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on (frac{4}{3}, 2) and (2, 4), and monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0), (0, frac{4}{3}), and (4, +infty), Therefore, when x=4, the function has a maximum value, i.e., f(4) = -frac{1}{2} + 1 = frac{1}{2}, When x= frac{4}{3}, the function has a minimum value, i.e., f(frac{4}{3}) = -frac{1}{2} + 1 = frac{9}{2}, Therefore, the range of f(x) is (-infty, frac{1}{2}] cup [frac{9}{2}, +infty).

Now, using the fact that ( cos(beta - gamma) leq 1 ), we obtain: [ 2 sin beta sin gamma leq 1 + cos(alpha) ] 4. Next, consider the expression for the altitude ( h_a ).

Let's take x in the interval and evaluate: For f(x): f(x) = x^2 For f(-x): f(-x) = (-x)^2 = x^2 From this initial comparison, it seems like f(x) could be an even function, as f(x) = f(-x).

Since the vertical shift of the graph does not affect the horizontal location of the symmetry center, the x coordinate of the center does not change due to the vertical shift of +1 in the function. Therefore, the center of symmetry x coordinate is x_c = frac {pi (2k+1)}{4}. The y coordinate of the center of symmetry is given by the vertical shift in the function, which is +1.

These sets are disjoint and can be assigned one color. - If ( l = md + s ) where ( m le r-1 ) and ( 0 le s < d ), we can partition the vertices into sets: [ {cd+1, cd+2, ldots, (c+1)d} quad text{for} quad 0 le c le m-1 ] and [ {md+1, md+2, ldots, md+s} quad text{if} quad s neq 0 ] Each set can be colored with one color. At most ( m+1 ) colors are used. If ( m < r-1 ) or ( m = r-1 ) and ( s = 0 ), we are done. So let ( m = r-1 ) and ( s > 0 ). 4. **Claim 1: The distance between two consecutive used labels is (le d-1) if there is no ( r-1 ) coloring.** - From the proof of Lemma 1, we can optimize the coloring by focusing on used labels. - Suppose a label ( x ) is used, and the label directly before it is at least ( d ) away (i.e., (le x-d)). WLOG, let ( 1 ) be the label (subtract ( x-1 ) from every label). Then there are no vertices with labels: [ {(r-1)d+1, (r-1)d+2, ldots, (r-1)d+s} ] We do not need the last color, and ( r-1 ) colors will suffice. Thus, the distance between two consecutive used labels is (le d-1). 5. **Claim 2: The second condition forbids that the distance between two consecutive used labels is always (le d-1).** - The set ( C ) must contain every vertex of label ( x ) if it contains at least one vertex labeled ( x ), according to our initial coloring in Lemma 1. - Alter the first coloring by adding ( x-1 ) everywhere. Then every vertex labeled ( y ) satisfying ( x < y le x+d-1 ) is also of the same color and must be in ( C ). There is at least one such label from what we have previously. Use this as the new ( x ), and eventually, every vertex must be in ( C ). 6. **Conclusion:** - Claims 1 and 2 cannot hold simultaneously, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( G ) must have a proper coloring with ( r-1 ) colors.

Now, let's look at the prime factorization of 15: 15 = 3 * 5 Since 823,435 has only one factor of 5, k can only be 0 or 1 because 15^k must be a divisor of 823,435. If k were greater than 1, then 15^k would have more than one factor of 5, which is not possible given the prime factorization of 823,435. If k = 0, then 15^k = 1, which is a divisor of any number, but the difference between any number raised to the power of 0 and 0 raised to the power of 5 is not 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and 0^5 is 0, the difference is 1 - 0 = 1, which actually does satisfy the condition). If k = 1, then 15^k = 15, which is also a divisor of 823,435. In this case, we are looking for a number x such that x^1 - 1^5 = 1, which simplifies to x - 1 = 1, so x = 2.

Replacing y^2 in the parabola's equation, we have: left(frac{2}{y_0}(x + x_0)right)^2 = 4x. Simplifying, we get: frac{4}{y_0^2}(x + x_0)^2 = 4x, (x + x_0)^2 = y_0^2x, x^2 + 2x_0x + x_0^2 = y_0^2x.

Because the point M(x_0, y_0) is inside the parabola, we know that y_0^2 < 4x_0. The discriminant simplifies to: Delta = (2x_0 - y_0^2)^2 - 4x_0^2 = 4x_0^2 - 4x_0y_0^2 + y_0^4 - 4x_0^2 = y_0^4 - 4x_0y_0^2. Since y_0^4 - 4x_0y_0^2 < 0 (as y_0^2 < 4x_0), the discriminant Delta < 0.

According to the problem, Leila spent 3/5 of her savings on make-up and 1/3 of her savings on a sweater. The cost of the sweater is given as 40, which represents 1/3 of her savings. Therefore, we can write: 1/3 * S = 40 To find the total savings (S), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3: S = 40 * 3 S = 120 Now we know that Leila's total savings were 120 before she made any purchases. She spent 3/5 of her savings on make-up, so let's calculate that amount: 3/5 * S = 3/5 * 120 3/5 * S = 72 So, Leila spent 72 on make-up. We already know she spent 40 on a sweater and 30 on shoes.

The mistake is that we assumed the total savings to be 120 based on the cost of the sweater alone, without considering the cost of the shoes. Since the sweater and shoes are the remaining parts of her savings after spending on make-up, we should add their costs together to represent the remaining 2/5 of her savings: Sweater + Shoes = 1/3 * S + Remaining Savings 40 (sweater) + 30 (shoes) = 1/3 * S + Remaining Savings The remaining savings are what she spent on the shoes, which is 30. Since we know that 3/5 of her savings were spent on make-up, the remaining 2/5 must have been spent on the sweater and shoes: 2/5 * S = 40 (sweater) + 30 (shoes) 2/5 * S = 70 Now, we can solve for S by multiplying both sides by 5/2: S = 70 * (5/2) S = 70 * 2.5 S = 175 Therefore, Leila's original savings were boxed{175} ."},{"prompt":"Construct a point ( O ) in the scalene triangle ( ABC ) such that the angles ( AOB ), ( BOC ), and ( COA ) are equal.","completion":"Given the triangle ( ABC ), we wish to construct a point ( O ) such that the angles ( angle AOB, angle BOC, ) and ( angle COA ) are all equal. 1. **Understanding the problem:** - We are given that the sum of the angles around point ( O ) should be ( 360^circ ). - Therefore, each of the angles ( angle AOB, angle BOC, ) and ( angle COA ) should be ( 120^circ ) because: [ frac{360^circ}{3} = 120^circ. ] 2. **Construct Equilateral Triangles:** - To proceed, construct equilateral triangles on each side of ( triangle ABC ).

This can be argued as follows: if cutting the cheese in the ratio a : (1 - a) allows for achieving the desired result, cutting it in the ratio 1 - a : a will result in the same outcome due to symmetry. 3. **Show suitability for the square root:** To prove that if a is suitable, then sqrt{a} is also suitable, we need to demonstrate how to cut a piece of cheese weighing 1 into parts in the ratio sqrt{a} : (1 - sqrt{a}) using cuts in the ratio a : (1 - a). - **First cut**: After the first cut, we have a piece of weight sqrt{a}. - **Second cut**: By cutting this piece, we obtain two parts, one of which weighs a.

Thus, -frac{pi}{3} < alpha - frac{pi}{3} < frac{pi}{2}. Consequently, we can find sin(alpha - frac{pi}{3}) using the pythagorean identity sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1: sin(alpha - frac{pi}{3}) = sqrt{1 - cos^2(alpha - frac{pi}{3})} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{4}{9}} = sqrt{frac{5}{9}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{3}.

Since the angle between SA and the base of the cone is 30°, the base radius (r) and height (h) can be found using trigonometry: r = 2sqrt{3} h = 2 Now, we can calculate the volume (V) of the cone: V = frac{1}{3} times pi times (2sqrt{3})^2 times 2 V = 8π Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{A}"},{"prompt":"Given a gt 0, b gt 0, find the minimum value of frac{1}{a}+frac{a}{{b}^{2}}+b.","completion":"# Method 1: AM-GM Inequality Given a > 0 and b > 0, we apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms frac{1}{a} and frac{a}{{b}^{2}}: frac{1}{a}+frac{a}{{b}^{2}} geq 2sqrt{frac{1}{a} cdot frac{a}{{b}^{2}}} = 2sqrt{frac{1}{{b}^{2}}} = frac{2}{b} Next, we add b to both sides of the inequality: frac{1}{a}+frac{a}{{b}^{2}}+b geq frac{2}{b}+b We apply the AM-GM inequality again to the terms frac{2}{b} and b: frac{2}{b}+b geq 2sqrt{frac{2}{b} cdot b} = 2sqrt{2} Therefore, we have: frac{1}{a}+frac{a}{{b}^{2}}+b geq 2sqrt{2} Equality holds when frac{1}{a}=frac{a}{{b}^{2}} and b=frac{2}{b}, which implies a=b=sqrt{2}.

Since we can have at most 14 distinct values of (a_m) (excluding extremities), (a_m) would form two difference pairs like ((a_i, a_m)) and ((a_k, a_m) ) such that (a_i - a_m = a_m - a_j) and (a_k - a_m = a_m - a_l). 10. Now, solving these equations: [ a_i - a_m = a_m - a_j quad text{and} quad a_k - a_m = a_m - a_l ] gives us: [ a_i + a_j = a_k + a_l ] 11. Thus, by contradiction and application of the pigeonhole principle along with equality of differences, we can conclude that among these 16 integers, it is assured there exist four distinct indices (i, j, k, l) such that (a_i + a_j = a_k + a_l).

We must calculate the ratio of the area favorable to the condition (at least one of the distances from point P to the vertices is less than 1) to the total area of the triangle. Let's break this down: 1. The total area of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times text{side}^2. Thus, the area of triangle ABC is A_{ABC} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 2^2 = sqrt{3}. 2. To satisfy the condition that at least one of the distances from P to the vertices is less than 1, point P should lie within one of the circles centered at the vertices A, B, or C with a radius of 1. 3. Draw three circles with a radius of 1 centered at each vertex of the triangle. The intersection of these circles with the triangle will create three smaller segments within the triangle where the points satisfy the given condition. 4. The area of each of these segments can be calculated by subtracting the area of the sector of the circle from the area of the corresponding equilateral triangle with side length 1. The area of the segment in one corner is A_{text{segment}} = A_{text{small triangle}} - A_{text{sector}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 1^2 - frac{1}{6}pi times 1^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{pi}{6}. 5. Since there are three such segments in the triangle, the total favorable area is A_{text{favorable}} = 3 times (frac{sqrt{3}}{4} - frac{pi}{6}). 6.

Initially, the vessel contains 30 litres of pure milk. Step 1: When 9 litres of milk is removed, there are 30 - 9 = 21 litres of milk left in the vessel.

The ratio of milk to water in the vessel remains the same as before this step, which is 21:9. Therefore, when we remove 9 litres of the mixture, we remove milk and water in the same 21:9 ratio. To find out how much milk is removed, we can set up a proportion: Milk removed / Total milk before removal = Total mixture removed / Total mixture before removal Milk removed / 21 = 9 / 30 Now, solve for the amount of milk removed: Milk removed = (9 / 30) * 21 Milk removed = (3 / 10) * 21 Milk removed = 63 / 10 Milk removed = 6.3 litres So, 6.3 litres of milk is removed in the second step.

According to Bézout's identity, there exist integers (x_0, y_0 in mathbf{Z} ) such that ( a_1 x_0 + b_1 y_0 = 1 ). Therefore, the equation ( a_1 x + b_1 y = c_1 ) has integer solutions. 3.

Since ( (d, c) = 1 ) and given ( n' > left( frac{a b}{d} + c d - a - b - c right) - frac{a b}{d} + a + b - d = c d - c - d ), it follows from the pre-established result that ( d w + c z = n' ) has non-negative integer solutions ( w, z ). 16. Finally, ( a_0 x + b_0 y = w' + a_0 b_0 - a_0 - b_0 + 1 > a_0 b_0 - a_0 - b_0 ), which means there are non-negative integer solutions ( x', y' ) to ( a x' + b y' + c z' = n ) by substituting ( w = w' + a_0 b_0 - a_0 - b_0 + 1 ).

Therefore, polynomials with rational coefficients are possible solutions. 2. **Converse Argument**: - To establish that the polynomials satisfying the given condition have to also necessarily have rational coefficients, we proceed as follows. Let ( P ) be a polynomial of degree ( n ) with complex coefficients such that ( P(q) ) is rational for every rational ( q ). 3. **Interpolation on Rational Points**: - Consider ( n+1 ) distinct rational points ( q_1, q_2, ldots, q_{n+1} ). By the assumption, ( P(q_i) ) is rational for each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n+1 ). 4. **Formulating Linear Systems**: - Since ( P ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ), it can be written in the form: [ P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ] where ( a_i in mathbb{C} ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, n ). 5. **Rational System of Equations**: - Evaluating ( P ) at ( n+1 ) rational points ( q_1, q_2, ldots, q_{n+1} ) yields the system of equations: [ begin{cases} P(q_1) = a_n q_1^n + a_{n-1} q_1^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 q_1 + a_0 = r_1 P(q_2) = a_n q_2^n + a_{n-1} q_2^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 q_2 + a_0 = r_2 vdots P(q_{n+1}) = a_n q_{n+1}^n + a_{n-1} q_{n+1}^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 q_{n+1} + a_0 = r_{n+1} end{cases} ] where ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{n+1} ) are rational quantities. 6. **Properties of Coefficients**: - The above system of linear equations in ( a_i )'s can be represented in matrix form: [ begin{pmatrix} q_1^n & q_1^{n-1} & cdots & q_1 & 1 q_2^n & q_2^{n-1} & cdots & q_2 & 1 vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots q_{n+1}^n & q_{n+1}^{n-1} & cdots & q_{n+1} & 1 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} a_n a_{n-1} vdots a_1 a_0 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} r_1 r_2 vdots r_{n+1} end{pmatrix} ] - The coefficient matrix is a Vandermonde matrix, which is known to be invertible when ( q_i ) are distinct. Therefore, there’s a unique solution for the coefficients ( a_n, a_{n-1}, ldots, a_1, a_0 ). Since ( q_i ) and ( r_i ) are rational, the computation using inverse of a Vandermonde matrix with rational elements will yield rational ( a_i )'s. 7. **Conclusion**: - As a result, if ( P(q) ) is rational for all rational ( q ), then the coefficients ( a_i ) must be rational as well. Hence, the polynomial ( P ) itself must have rational coefficients. Therefore, the only polynomials ( P ) that satisfy the condition are those with rational coefficients.

Define ( S ) as the reflection symmetry with respect to the perpendicular bisector ( l ) of the segment ( AA' ). 2. **Composition with Symmetry**: Since ( S ) is the reflection with respect to the perpendicular bisector of ( AA' ), [ S circ F(A) = A ] This tells us that ( A ) is a fixed point of the transformation ( S circ F ). 3. **Fixed Points Analysis**: Similarly, if ( X ) is any fixed point of ( F ), meaning ( F(X) = X ), then the distance ( AX = A'X ) must hold. Consequently, any fixed point ( X ) of ( F ) lies on the line ( l ). This observation shows that [ S circ F(X) = S(X) = X ] confirming that ( S circ F ) fixes ( X ). Hence, ( A ) and all fixed points of ( F ) are also fixed points of ( S circ F ). 4. **Selecting Points for Transformation**: Now, consider three points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) that are non-collinear (do not lie on the same straight line), and observe their images under a given motion ( G ). 5. **Constructing Necessary Symmetries**: We can construct suitable transformations ( S_1, S_2, ) and ( S_3 ), which are either symmetries with respect to lines or the identity transformation, to ensure that the composition ( S_3 circ S_2 circ S_1 circ G ) leaves points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) fixed. 6. **Composition Equality**: This composition, ( S_3 circ S_2 circ S_1 circ G ), must be the identity transformation ( E ) because it leaves three non-collinear points fixed, thus fixing the entire plane. 7. **Simplifying the Composition**: By multiplying both sides of the equation ( S_3 circ S_2 circ S_1 circ G = E ) first by ( S_3 ), then by ( S_2 ), and lastly by ( S_1 ), and using the property ( S_i circ S_i = E ) (the composition of a reflection with itself is the identity transformation), we derive: [ G = S_1 circ S_2 circ S_3 ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that any motion (isometry) of the plane can be expressed as the composition of no more than three reflections with respect to lines.

Solving for ( P ): [ frac{1}{3}P = 3X - X ] [ frac{1}{3}P = 2X ] [ P = 6X ] So, initially, Pooh had 6 parts when Piglet had 1 part of the cake. 4.

We can use mathematical induction to prove this identity. **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ): [ 1 = 1^2 ] The base case holds true. **Inductive Step:** Assume for ( n = k ), the formula holds: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + (2k-1) = k^2 ] For ( n = k + 1 ): [ S_{text{new}} = 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) ] By the inductive hypothesis: [ S_{text{new}} = k^2 + (2(k+1)-1) ] Simplify: [ S_{text{new}} = k^2 + (2k+2-1) ] [ S_{text{new}} = k^2 + 2k + 1 ] [ S_{text{new}} = (k+1)^2 ] Hence, the formula holds for ( n = k+1 ) as well, thereby completing the induction proof.

We need to determine if the product of the sum of these integers, multiplied by their product, could equal 20182017. 3. We start with the equation: [ a cdot b cdot (a+b) = 20182017 ] 4. Notice that 20182017 is an odd number; therefore, each factor on the left-hand side of the equation must collectively result in an odd number. 5.

We need to find the value of a_{10} after 10 moves. To do this, we will solve the recurrence relation. 4. First, let's find the general form of the sequence. We can solve the recurrence relation using the method of characteristic equations. The homogeneous part of the recurrence relation is: [ a_{n+1} = 3a_n ] The characteristic equation is: [ r = 3 ] So, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is: [ a_n^{(h)} = C cdot 3^n ] where C is a constant. 5. For the particular solution, we assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the non-homogeneous recurrence relation: [ A = 3A + 5 ] Solving for A: [ A - 3A = 5 implies -2A = 5 implies A = -frac{5}{2} ] 6. The general solution to the recurrence relation is: [ a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C cdot 3^n - frac{5}{2} ] 7. Using the initial condition a_0 = 1: [ 1 = C cdot 3^0 - frac{5}{2} implies 1 = C - frac{5}{2} implies C = frac{7}{2} ] 8. Therefore, the solution to the recurrence relation is: [ a_n = frac{7}{2} cdot 3^n - frac{5}{2} ] 9.

There are two construction methods: **Method I:** 1. Let (triangle ABC) be the desired triangle. 2. Extend sides (AB) and (AC). Construct the circle tangent to the angle (alpha) and externally tangent to the triangle. 3. The center of this circle (I_1) lies on the angle bisector of (alpha). If the tangency points are (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1), then: [ BA_1 = BC_1 quad text{and} quad CA_1 = CB_1 ] 4. Since (AB_1 = AC_1), and: [ AB_1 + AC_1 = AC + CB_1 + AB + BC_1 = AC + AB + BC = 2s ] 5. Clearly, this gives: [ AB_1 = AC_1 = s ] 6. Side (BC) is a tangent from (A) to a circle centered at (I_1) with radius (AI_1 = m_a). Hence, the construction steps are as follows: a. Measure (AB_1 = AC_1 = s) along the angle (alpha) rays. b. At (B_1) and (C_1), draw perpendiculars to (AB_1) and (AC_1) respectively. These perpendiculars intersect the angle bisector at (I_1). c. Draw circles centered at (I_1) with radius (I_1B_1 = I_1C_1) and at (A) with radius (AH = m_a). The common internal tangents of these circles will be (BC). **Verification Condition:** - The circles must have a common internal tangent. They must touch externally at point (K). [ AK = AI_1 - KI_1 = frac{AB_1}{cos (alpha/2)} - I_1B_1 = frac{s}{cos (alpha/2)} - stan (alpha/2) = frac{s}{cos (alpha/2)}left(1 - sin (alpha/2)right) ] Hence, the condition for the construction is: [ m_a < frac{sleft(1 - sin (alpha/2)right)}{cos (alpha/2)} ] **Method II:** 1. Extend (BC) in both directions and measure the distances (BD = BA) and (CE = CA), creating (triangle ADE). 2. Hence, (DE = DB + BC + CE = AB + BC + CA = 2s). 3. Height (AH = m_a) corresponds to height from (A) in (triangle ADE). 4. In (triangle ABD) (isosceles): - The base angles sum to (beta), thus each base angle is (beta/2). 5. Similarly, in (triangle ACE): - The base angles in (triangle ACE) sum to (gamma), so each is (gamma/2). 6. Therefore: [ angle DAE = alpha + frac{beta}{2} + frac{gamma}{2} = alpha + frac{beta + gamma}{2} = alpha + 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} = 90^circ + frac{alpha}{2} ] 7.

Taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x gives us: f'(x) = frac{2a}{2ax+1} + x^2 - 2x - 2a For f'(x) geq 0 on [3, +infty), we have to consider two cases based on the value of a: a. When a=0, we have f'(x) = x^2 - 2x, which is non-negative for x geq 3, therefore a=0 is a valid solution. b. When a neq 0, from the domain of f(x) we know 2ax+1 > 0 for x geq 3.

The quadratic function g(x) has its axis of symmetry at x = frac{1-4a}{4a}, and because a>0, this point is less than 1. To ensure g(x) geq 0 on [3, +infty), it's sufficient to check if g(3) geq 0: g(3)=-4a^2 +6a +1 geq 0 This leads us to: frac {3- sqrt {13}}{4} leq a leq frac {3+ sqrt {13}}{4} Because a > 0, the range of a is: 0 < a leq frac {3+ sqrt {13}}{4} Thus the range of a such that f(x) is increasing on [3, +infty) is boxed{0 < a leq frac {3+ sqrt {13}}{4}}. 2.

Thus the maximum of h(x) occurs at x=1, which gives: h(x) leq h(1) = 0 And as a consequence, for x > 0 we conclude: b = xcdot h(x) leq 0 The maximum value of b is achieved at x=1, hence the maximum value of b is boxed{0}."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 2ax + 2, and when x in [1, +infty), f(x) geq a always holds.

For inequality (1) to always hold true over the given interval, Delta leq 0 is a necessary condition. We can solve for a: Delta = 4a^2 - 4(2 - a) leq 0, 4a^2 - 8 + 4a leq 0, a^2 + a - 2 leq 0, (a - 1)(a + 2) leq 0. From this, we get that -2 leq a leq 1 covers the cases where the discriminant is non-positive, and thus the quadratic expression has no real roots or a repeated root, which satisfies the inequality over the entire interval. Now let's analyze the case when Delta > 0: When Delta > 0, two distinct real roots exist. We divide this into two sub-cases: Case 1: For a > 1, the vertex of the parabola x = a is to the right of -1. Hence, the minimum value over the interval [-1, +infty) is achieved at x = a. The value is: f(a) = a^2 - 2a^2 + 2 - a = 2 - a - a^2. We require f(a) geq 0, however this does not hold for a > 1, hence there are no solutions in this case. Case 2: For a < -2, the function is strictly increasing within [-1, +infty). The minimum value occurs at x = -1. Thus: f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 2a(-1) + 2 - a = 1 + 2a + 2 - a = 3 + a. For f(-1) geq 0, we find that a geq -3. Combined with a < -2, we then have -3 leq a < -2.

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 96 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 96 * (10/36) m/s = 960/36 m/s = 26.67 m/s Now, we know that the train completely crosses the bridge in 15 seconds. This means that in 15 seconds, the train covers the length of itself plus the length of the bridge. Let's denote the length of the train as L (in meters). The total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge is: L (length of the train) + 300 meters (length of the bridge) Since distance = speed * time, we can write: L + 300 = speed of the train * time taken to cross the bridge Substituting the values we have: L + 300 = 26.67 m/s * 15 s Now, we solve for L: L + 300 = 400.05 m Subtract 300 meters from both sides to find the length of the train: L = 400.05 m - 300 m L = 100.05 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{100.05} meters."},{"prompt":"Which of the following operations is correct?

Light B glows every 35 seconds: 4969 seconds / 35 seconds/glow = 141.9714 Again, taking the whole number, we get 141 glows for Light B.

Here, CA is the hypotenuse. 2. **Understand the tangency and implications:** The circle omega is tangent to side BC at point C and passes through A. We need to find the radius r of omega. 3. **Construct additional points and lines:** - Let O be the center of circle omega. - Let M be the foot of the perpendicular from O to AC. Therefore, OM perp AC, implying that OM passes through C because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. - Consequently, angle OCM = angle BAC. 4. **Identify and use similar triangles:** Since angle OCM = angle BAC, triangles ABC and CMO are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. 5. **Set up the ratio from similar triangles:** - From the similarity of triangles ABC and CMO, we have: [ frac{CO}{CM} = frac{CA}{AB} ] - Substitute the known values: CA = 5 and AB = 4.

Express CM in terms of CO = r. - If frac{CO}{CM} = frac{5}{4}, then we have: [ frac{r}{CM} = frac{5}{4} ] - Expressing CM: CM = frac{4r}{5}. 7. **Step through solving for r:** - Use another relationship within the triangle to validate O to C’s distance utilizing the tangent properties. - Given that OM perp AC and O is such that CM = frac{4r}{5}, the proportion also holds as CO = frac{5}{4}CM [ CO = frac{5}{4}left( frac{4r}{5} right) = r ] - Reviewing the triangle properties and possible solutions lead CO expressed fundamentally without mismatch in terms. 8. **Conclusion:** - Substituting proper dimensions again reassures validating r = frac{25}{8} accurately conforms to circle alignment factoring extension tangents and primary triangle similarity.

Construct a directed complete graph G = (V, E) where: - Each vertex C_i has directed edges to every other vertex C_j. - The edge from C_i to C_j is colored by k if C_j is the k-th closest city to C_i. Since distances are unique, this possible ranking from closest to farthest is well-defined. 2. **Define the Property S(k):** We state that graph G satisfies property S(k) if and only if there exists a subgraph T_k that is a rooted tree of height k with k distinct colors on its edges such that k-1 vertices have out-degree exactly 1. Essentially, every layer in the tree contributes a new color up to k, establishing connectivity with all lower layers. 3. **Initial Setup and Aim:** The problem reduces to proving that graph G satisfies property S(n), meaning we can connect all vertices in a tree of height n-1 having n-1 distinct edge colors. 4. **Proof by Contradiction:** Suppose the largest k for which G satisfies S(k) is less than n. So, assume T_k is a k-tree satisfying S(k). Within T_k, there are n-k remaining vertices not part of T_k. 5. **Adding a New Vertex:** Consider any vertex C not in T_k. We note that: - C connects to each of the k vertices in T_k by directed edges. - These edges have colors 1, 2, ldots, k respectively since each vertex in T_k must be at a unique color-distance from C. 6. **Extension to T_{k+1}:** Since edges are colored distinctly, C must connect to some vertex v in T_k via an edge of a new color not previously in T_k. Including C and this edge in T_k creates a new tree T_{k+1} with k+1 distinct edge colors, which contradicts the assumption that k is maximal. 7. **Conclusion:** Since assuming k < n leads to a contradiction, G must satisfy property S(n).

From the problem, we have two equations based on the given information: 1. For 1 jin of Zhao Tong apples and 2 jin of Tianma from Xiaocaoba, the cost is 105 yuan, which gives us the equation: x + 2y = 105. 2. For 3 jin of Zhao Tong apples and 5 jin of Tianma from Xiaocaoba, the cost is 265 yuan, leading to the equation: 3x + 5y = 265. To solve these equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of x in both equations: 3(x + 2y) = 3 cdot 105 implies 3x + 6y = 315. - Subtract the second equation from this result to eliminate x: (3x + 6y) - (3x + 5y) = 315 - 265 implies y = 50. - Substitute y = 50 into the first equation to find x: x + 2 cdot 50 = 105 implies x = 5.

Given the combination of constraints, we need to use graph theory for a comprehensive solution.

This implies that each vertex will have a degree of 5 in the colored graph, ensuring that each vertex retains a degree constraint of having one edge of each color. **Step 3: Constructive Coloring** One effective way to do such coloring is to utilize properties of cyclic graphs and combinatorial methods.

We have: - One team having played exactly 11 games. - Three teams having played exactly 9 games each. - Two teams having played exactly 6 games each. - Four teams having played exactly 4 games each. - Two teams having played exactly 1 game each. 2. **Analysis of the team that played 11 games:** The team that has played exactly 11 games must have played against every other team in the tournament since there are 12 teams in total and they have played one less than this total. Therefore, the two teams that have played only 1 game each can only have played against this team that played 11 games. 3. **Analyzing the teams that played 9 games:** The teams that have played exactly 9 games would mean these teams played with all except two other teams. Given the setup: - They did not play against the two teams with only 1 game each, which we understood are limited to playing only with the team that played 11 games. Each of these three teams must have also played with: - The team that played 11 games. - The other three teams that played 9 games. - All other teams, except the ones with 1 game and some possibly others covered later. 4. **Consideration of teams with 4 games and their opponents:** The four teams each with 4 games played must have: - Played against the team that played 11 games. - Also each played against the three teams that played 9 games. 5. **Addressing the teams that played 6 games:** Next, we must consider the two teams that have played 6 games. Both these teams: - Played against the team that played 11 games. - Played against the three teams that played 9 games. - They must play against each other to make up for their additional games. 6. **Missing games verification:** For the two teams playing only 1 game and no game left for remaining teams, the setup they need should fit the structured pattern if any anomaly arises: - The two teams playing 1 game obviously played against the 11-game team. - If they did plan games within such groups of 6 or 4 games, they must also aggregate each other's standings for completeness. 7. **Total verification leading to contradiction:** If strictly verifying each step, we can compute the degrees and see: - The team with 4 games each needs one game left not possible from only 1-gamers limiting validity. - Similarly, 6-game teams envisaged cannot fit extra unknown teams plausibly. Considering all of these analyses collectively openly reveals the scenario's inherent contradictions.

If a red ball is drawn, the customer wins a prize; if a yellow ball is drawn, the customer does not win. Additionally, customers who do not win are allowed to return the ball they drew to the bag and add one red or yellow ball (of the same size and quality as the four balls in the bag). Then, one ball is randomly drawn from the bag, the color is noted, the ball is not returned to the bag, and another ball is drawn.

Part 2: Optimal Color of Ball to Add for a Better Chance to Receive a Fine Gift - If the customer does not win on the first draw and decides to add a ball to the bag, they have a choice between adding a red or a yellow ball. Let's analyze the outcomes for each scenario. # Scenario 1: Adding a Red Ball - If a red ball is added, the possible outcomes for drawing two balls where the colors are the same are limited to drawing two red balls or drawing two yellow balls of the same number. This gives us a total of 8 such outcomes. # Scenario 2: Adding a Yellow Ball - If a yellow ball (denoted as \\"new\\") is added, the possible outcomes for drawing two balls where the colors are the same increase because we can draw the new yellow ball and any of the other yellow balls, in addition to the outcomes available without adding any ball. This gives us a total of 12 such outcomes. - Calculating the probabilities for each scenario: - (i) When a red ball is added, the probability of receiving a fine gift is: P_1 = frac{8}{20} = frac{2}{5}. - (ii) When a yellow ball is added, the probability of receiving a fine gift is: P_2 = frac{12}{20} = frac{3}{5}. - Comparing the probabilities, we find that frac{2}{5} < frac{3}{5}, which means P_{1} < P_{2}. - Therefore, for a better chance to receive a fine gift, the customer should add a yellow ball to the bag. The reasoning behind this is that adding a yellow ball increases the number of favorable outcomes for drawing two balls of the same color. Hence, the customer should add a boxed{text{yellow ball}} to the bag for a better chance to receive a fine gift."},{"prompt":"The cost price of 30 books is equal to the selling price of 40 books.

To do this, we need to find the relationship between the cost price and the selling price of one book. From the equation above, we can find the selling price (S) in terms of the cost price (C): S = (30C) / 40 S = (3C) / 4 Now we can see that the selling price (S) is less than the cost price (C), which means there is a loss. To find the loss amount for one book, we subtract the selling price from the cost price: Loss = C - S Loss = C - (3C / 4) Loss = (4C / 4) - (3C / 4) Loss = (4C - 3C) / 4 Loss = C / 4 Now, to find the loss percentage, we divide the loss by the cost price and multiply by 100: Loss Percentage = (Loss / C) * 100 Loss Percentage = (C / 4) / C * 100 Loss Percentage = (1 / 4) * 100 Loss Percentage = 25% Therefore, there is a loss of boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"A cylindrical jug is threequarters full of orange juice.

Since the growth rate applies to both the second and third months, we can model the total number of bikes in the third month as 1000(1+x)^2. This accounts for the growth in the second month and then again in the third month. Therefore, we set up the equation as follows: [1000(1+x)^2 = 1000 + 440] This equation correctly represents the situation described, where 1000(1+x)^2 is the number of bikes in the third month, and 1000 + 440 is the total number of bikes the company aimed to have by the third month.

The weight of the new person is 90 kg. By how much does the average weight increase?","completion":"Let's call the average weight of the 10 persons before the new person arrives A. When the new person arrives, the total weight of the group increases by the difference between the new person's weight and the weight of the person they are replacing. The weight of the person being replaced is 65 kg, and the weight of the new person is 90 kg. So the total weight of the group increases by: 90 kg - 65 kg = 25 kg Since this increase in total weight is distributed over the same 10 persons, the average weight increases by the total increase divided by the number of persons: Increase in average weight = Total increase in weight / Number of persons Increase in average weight = 25 kg / 10 Increase in average weight = 2.5 kg So the average weight increases by boxed{2.5} kg."},{"prompt":"Let x be an integer.

How many muffins did each student get on that day?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of muffins as M and the number of muffins each student was originally supposed to get as x. If the muffins were to be equally distributed among the 400 students, we have: M = 400 * x However, on the actual day, only 400 - 180 = 220 students were present. Since each student got 36 extra muffins due to the absence of the others, the new number of muffins each student got is x + 36. So we can also express the total number of muffins as: M = 220 * (x + 36) Now we have two expressions for M, which we can set equal to each other: 400 * x = 220 * (x + 36) Now we solve for x: 400x = 220x + 220 * 36 400x - 220x = 220 * 36 180x = 220 * 36 Divide both sides by 180 to solve for x: x = (220 * 36) / 180 Simplify the right side: x = (22 * 36) / 18 x = (11 * 36) / 9 x = 11 * 4 x = 44 So each student was originally supposed to get 44 muffins.

Since he travels for 30 minutes at a speed of 20 miles per hour, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time However, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours to match the units of speed (miles per hour). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is equal to 30/60 hours, which is 0.5 hours. Now we can calculate the distance: Distance = 20 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 10 miles This means Greg travels 10 miles from the farmer's market to his home. Since Greg travels a total of 40 miles, and we know that 10 miles of that is from the farmer's market to his home, we can find out how many miles he drives from his workplace to the farmer's market by subtracting the 10 miles from the total distance: Total distance - Distance from farmer's market to home = Distance from workplace to farmer's market 40 miles - 10 miles = 30 miles Therefore, Greg drives boxed{30} miles from his workplace to the farmer's market."},{"prompt":"What is the remainder when 1,493,829 is divided by 7?","completion":"To find the remainder when 1,493,829 is divided by 7, we perform the division directly or use a calculator if allowed. 1.

Originally, John spent 4 coffees * 2/coffee = 8 per day. After the price increase, he buys half the number of coffees, so he buys 2 coffees a day.

Total weight of 19 students = average weight * number of students Total weight of 19 students = 15 kg * 19 Total weight of 19 students = 285 kg Now, let's find the total weight of the class after the three new students joined. Total weight of 22 students (19 original + 3 new) = new average weight * new number of students Total weight of 22 students = 14.9 kg * 22 Total weight of 22 students = 327.8 kg The total weight of the three new students is the difference between the total weight of the class before and after they joined. Total weight of 3 new students = total weight of 22 students - total weight of 19 students Total weight of 3 new students = 327.8 kg - 285 kg Total weight of 3 new students = 42.8 kg Now, let's find the weight of each new student based on the given information. Let the weight of the lightest student before the new students joined be L kg. Then, the first new student weighs L - 1.5 kg. The second new student weighs 2 kg more than the average weight before they joined, which was 15 kg. So, the second new student weighs 15 kg + 2 kg = 17 kg. The third new student has the same weight as the new class average, which is 14.9 kg. Now, we can set up an equation to find the weight of the first new student (L - 1.5 kg) using the total weight of the three new students. (L - 1.5) + 17 + 14.9 = 42.8 Solving for L: L - 1.5 + 17 + 14.9 = 42.8 L + 30.4 = 42.8 L = 42.8 - 30.4 L = 12.4 kg So, the weight of the lightest student before the new students joined was 12.4 kg.

This ensures that the circle's plane will intersect the projection plane correctly. 2. **Tangency Construction:** - Use a cone whose vertex is one of the given points (say ( A )). - If we draw a tangent plane to this cone passing through the other given point ( B ), this tangent plane will be the required circle's plane. - This is because the plane must touch the projection plane and also pass through both points ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Determine the Circle Plane:** - The construction involves finding the intersection line (generatrix) of the cone from ( A ) to ( B ). - This line will help us establish the plane containing the circle which is both inclined at ( 60^circ ) to the projection plane and passes through ( A ) and ( B ). 4. **Rotate Into First Projection Plane:** - Once the plane containing the circle is found, rotate this plane along with the points within it into the first projection plane. - By rotating, the first projection will allow us to view the circle in a simplified top-down manner. 5. **Construct Circle Using Apollonius' Problem:** - In the rotated projection, determine the tangency point by solving Apollonius' problem (specifically, the second Apollonius problem which involves a circle tangent to a line and passing through two points). - Knowing that the plane must be tangent to the first projection plane ensures that it simplifies this geometric problem, allowing precise construction in the rotated view. 6. **Restore Original Position:** - After solving and constructing the circle in the rotated position, transform it back to its original orientation. - This results in the desired circle in the original configuration. # Conclusion: We have effectively used geometric principles and constructions to solve for the circle’s position respecting the given constraints.

Let's denote the individuals by (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_7). 2. **Degree Constraint**: Each person must be acquainted with at least 3 others. - Suppose there exists a person (X) who is acquainted with fewer than 3 people. - Removing one of their acquaintainces would result in a group of six where (X) cannot sit next to more than one acquaintance. 3. **Contradiction in Pair Count**: - Consider if everyone were connected to exactly 3 people, the total number of pairs of acquaintances would be counted twice in the process. - Since there are 7 people, and each has 3 connections, ideally ( frac{7 times 3}{2} = 10.5 ) pairs, which is a contradiction because the number of pairs must be an integer. 4. **Conclusion from Observation**: By contradiction, at least one person ( X ) must have at least 4 acquaintances. 5. **Placement Strategy**: - Consider the seating arrangement of the remaining six people (excluding ( X )). - Since more than 4 of them are acquaintances of ( X ), by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these acquaintances must sit next to each other. 6. **Ensuring Acquaintance Integrity**: - Place ( X ) between these two neighbors. - As ( X ) is adjacent to at least two of their acquaintances, and all others are already properly seated by hypothesis, everyone will be correctly positioned.

Rarely, children whose coronary (heart) arteries are affected may need medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include: Reducing fever and inflammation to improve symptoms Preventing the disease from affecting the coronary arteries Initial Treatment Kawasaki disease can cause serious health problems. Thus, your child will likely be treated in a hospital, at least for the early part of treatment. The standard treatment during the disease's acute phase is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine that's injected into a vein. Most children who receive these treatments improve greatly within 24 hours. For a small number of children, fever remains. These children may need a second round of immune globulin. At the start of treatment, your child will receive high doses of aspirin. As soon as his or her fever goes away, a low dose of aspirin is given. The low dose helps prevent blood clots, which can form in the inflamed small arteries. Most children treated for Kawasaki disease fully recover from the acute phase and don't need any further treatment. They should, however, follow a healthy diet and adopt healthy lifestyle habits. Taking these steps can help lower the risk of future heart disease. (Following a healthy lifestyle is advised for all children, not just those who have Kawasaki disease.) Children who have had immune globulin should wait 11 months before having the measles and chicken pox vaccines. Immune globulin can prevent those vaccines from working well. Long-Term Care and Treatment If Kawasaki disease has affected your child's coronary arteries, he or she will need ongoing care and treatment. It's best if a pediatric cardiologist provides this care to reduce the risk of severe heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children who have heart problems. Medicines and Tests When Kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, they may expand and twist. If this happens, your child's doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medicines (for example, warfarin). These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the affected coronary arteries. Blood-thinning medicines usually are stopped after the coronary arteries heal. Healing may occur about 18 months after the acute phase of the disease. In a small number of children, the coronary arteries don't heal. These children likely will need routine tests, such as: Echocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart. EKG (electrocardiogram). This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. Stress test. This test provides information about how the heart works during physical activity or stress. Medical Procedures and Surgery Rarely, a child who has Kawasaki disease may needcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Doctors use this procedure to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. A flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to the heart. Through the catheter, doctors can perform tests and treatments on the heart. Very rarely, a child may need to have other procedures or surgery if inflammation narrows his or her coronary arteries and blocks blood flow to the heart. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent placement, or coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) may be used. Coronary angioplasty restores blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. A thin tube with a balloon on the end is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or groin. The tube is threaded to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Then, the balloon is inflated to widen the artery and restore blood flow. A stent (small mesh tube) may be placed in the coronary artery during angioplasty. This device helps support the narrowed or weakened artery. A stent can improve blood flow and prevent the artery from bursting. Rarely, a child may need to have CABG. This surgery is used to treat blocked coronary arteries. During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the coronary artery. This improves blood flow to the heart."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Kawasaki Disease ?","completion":"Kawasaki disease can't be prevented.

These substances also are known as antigens (AN-tih-jens). People are exposed to antigens at home, while at work, and in other settings. However, most people who breathe in these substances don't develop HP. Overview To understand HP, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood through your body. In HP, the air sacs become inflamed and may fill with fluid. This makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sacs and into the bloodstream. The two main types of HP are acute (short-term) and chronic (ongoing). Both types can develop as a result of repeatedly breathing in an antigen. Over time, your lungs can become sensitive to that antigen. If this happens, they'll become inflamed, which can lead to symptoms and may even cause long-term lung damage. With acute HP, symptoms usually occur within 29 hours of exposure to an antigen you're sensitive to. Acute HP can cause chills, body aches, coughing, and chest tightness. After hours or days of no contact with the antigen, symptoms usually go away. If acute HP isn't found and treated early, chronic HP may develop. Symptoms of chronic HP occur slowly, over months. Chronic HP can cause a worsening cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss. Severe HP may cause clubbing (a widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes). With chronic HP, symptoms may continue and/or worsen, even after avoiding the antigen. Sometimes, chronic HP can cause long-term lung damage, such as pulmonary fibrosis (PULL-mun-ary fi-BRO-sis). This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. Outlook Avoiding or reducing your contact with antigens can help prevent and treat HP. For example, cleaning heating and ventilation filters can help reduce your contact with mold. Wetting compost prior to handling it can reduce contact with harmful dust. If HP is caught early, avoiding the antigen that caused it may be the only treatment you need. If you have chronic HP, your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce lung inflammation. Researchers continue to study why some people develop HP after being exposed to antigens, while others don't. They're also looking for better ways to quickly pinpoint which antigens are causing HP in people who are believed to have the disease."},{"prompt":"What causes Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ?","completion":"Repeatedly breathing in foreign substances can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP).

Antigens can come from many sources, such as: Bird droppings Humidifiers, heating systems, and hot tubs Liquid chemicals used in the landscaping and florist industries Moldy hay, straw, and grain Chemicals released during the production of plastics and electronics, and chemicals released during painting Mold released during lumber milling, construction, and wood stripping"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis? ?","completion":"People who repeatedly breathe in foreign substances are at risk for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). These substances, which also are known as antigens, include molds, dusts, and chemicals. However, most people who breathe in these substances don't develop HP. People at increased risk include: Farm and dairy cattle workers People who use hot tubs often People who are exposed to molds or dusts from humidifiers, heating systems, or wet carpeting Bird fanciers (people who keep pet birds) and poultry handlers Florists and landscapers, especially those who use liquid chemicals on lawns and gardens People who work in grain and flour processing and loading Lumber milling, construction, wood stripping, and paper and wallboard workers People who make plastics or electronics, and those who paint or work with other chemicals"},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ?","completion":"Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) depend on whether the disease is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). Acute Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis With acute HP, symptoms usually occur within 29 hours of exposure to an antigen you're sensitive to. (An antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.) Acute HP can cause chills, body aches, coughing, and chest tightness. After hours or days of no contact with the antigen, symptoms usually go away. Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis If acute HP isn't found and treated early, chronic HP may develop. With chronic HP, symptoms occur slowly, over months. Chronic HP can cause a worsening cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss. Some symptoms may continue and/or worsen, even after avoiding the antigen. Chronic HP can cause long-term lung damage, such as pulmonary fibrosis. This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. Clubbing also may occur if HP is severe. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes. A low level of oxygen in the blood causes this condition."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ?","completion":"To diagnose hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), your doctor must pinpoint the antigen that's causing the disease and its source. (An antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.) Your doctor will ask you detailed questions about: Your current and past jobs Your hobbies and leisure activities The types of places where you spend time Your exposure to damp and moldy places Your doctor also will do a physical exam and look at test results to diagnose HP. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms, such as coughing and weight loss. Your doctor also will look for signs of HP. For example, he or she will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope for abnormal breathing sounds. HP can cause a crackling sound when you breathe. Your doctor also may look for signs of pulmonary fibrosis, a possible complication of chronic (ongoing) HP. Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. Your doctor also may check for clubbing. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes. A low level of oxygen in the blood causes this condition. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures To help diagnose HP, your doctor may recommend or more of the following tests or procedures. Chest X Ray or Chest Computed Tomography (CT) Scan A chest x ray and chest CT scan create pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of HP. Lung Function Tests Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs can deliver oxygen to your blood. One of these tests is spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre). During this test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath. Then, you'll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. The machine measures how much air you breathe out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Pulse Oximetry This test measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Precipitin Test This blood test looks for antibodies (proteins) that your body creates in response to antigens. The presence of these proteins may suggest HP. Challenge Test During this test, you're re-exposed to the suspected antigen. Then, you'll be watched for signs and symptoms of HP. Bronchoscopy For bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee), your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. At the tip of the tube are a light and mini-camera. This allows your doctor to see your windpipe and airways. Your doctor may insert forceps (a device used to grab or hold things) through the tube to collect a tissue sample. You'll be given medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy during the procedure. Bronchoalveolar Lavage During bronchoscopy, your doctor may inject a small amount of salt water (saline) through the tube into your lungs. This method is called bronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH). This fluid washes the lungs and helps bring up cells from the airways and the area around the air sacs. Your doctor will look at these cells under a microscope. Surgical Lung Biopsy To confirm a diagnosis of HP, your doctor may do a surgical lung biopsy. Your doctor can use a biopsy to rule out other causes of symptoms and check the condition of your lungs. For a surgical lung biopsy, your doctor takes samples of lung tissue from several places in your lungs. He or she then looks at them under a microscope. Your doctor may use one of the following methods to get lung tissue samples. Video-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, your doctor inserts a small, lighted tube with a camera (endoscope) into your chest through small cuts between your ribs. The endoscope provides a video image of your lungs and allows your doctor to collect tissue samples. This procedure is done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to help you sleep through the procedure. Thoracotomy (thor-ah-KOT-o-me). For this procedure, your doctor removes a few small pieces of lung tissue through a cut in the chest wall between your ribs. Thoracotomy is done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to help you sleep through the procedure."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis ?","completion":"The best way to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is to avoid the antigen that caused it. (An antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.) In acute (short-term) HP, symptoms usually go away once you're no longer in contact with the antigen. In chronic (ongoing) HP, you may need medicines to relieve your symptoms. People who have chronic HP may develop pulmonary fibrosis. This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. People who have this condition may need further treatment, such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab). Avoiding Antigens Once the antigen that caused the HP and its source are found, you can take steps to avoid it. If HP is caught early, avoiding the antigen may be the only treatment you need. Avoiding an antigen may be easier at home than at work. For example, if your pet bird, moldy carpet, or hot tub is the source of the antigen, you can remove it from your home. If your heating system is the source of the antigen, you can have your system properly serviced. However, if the antigen is at work, you may need to talk with your supervisor about your condition and ways to protect yourself. For example, masks or personal respirators may help protect you from antigens in the air. (A personal respirator is a device that helps filter the air you breathe in.) Some people who have HP may need to move to a different home or change jobs to avoid antigens. After hurricanes, for example, some people have to move from their homes to avoid molds that could harm their lungs. However, moving and changing jobs sometimes isn't possible. Medicines and Other Treatments If you have chronic HP, your doctor may prescribe medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines reduce lung inflammation. Prednisone is an example of a corticosteroid. Long-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Thus, if your doctor prescribes this medicine, he or she may reduce the dose over time. Examples of side effects from corticosteroids are increased risk of infections, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and osteoporosis (thinning of the skin and bones). People who develop pulmonary fibrosis may need medicines, oxygen therapy, and/or pulmonary rehab. Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking can make HP symptoms worse and lead to other lung diseases. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke."},{"prompt":"What is (are) High Blood Pressure ?","completion":"Espaol High blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels (arteries) at higher than normal pressures. Measuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, sometimes called hypertension, happens when this force is too high. Health care workers check blood pressure readings the same way for children, teens, and adults. They use a gauge, stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. With this equipment, they measure: Systolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood Diastolic Pressure: blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats Health care workers write blood pressure numbers with the systolic number above the diastolic number. For example: 118/76 mmHg People read \\"118 over 76\\" millimeters of mercury. Normal Blood Pressure Normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg. It is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep, wake up, or are excited or nervous. When you are active, it is normal for your blood pressure to increase. However, once the activity stops, your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range. Blood pressure normally rises with age and body size. Newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies, while older teens have numbers similar to adults. Abnormal Blood Pressure Abnormal increases in blood pressure are defined as having blood pressures higher than 120/80 mmHg. The following table outlines and defines high blood pressure severity levels. Stages of High Blood Pressure in Adults The ranges in the table are blood pressure guides for adults who do not have any short-term serious illnesses. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should keep their blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. Although blood pressure increases seen in prehypertension are less than those used to diagnose high blood pressure, prehypertension can progress to high blood pressure and should be taken seriously. Over time, consistently high blood pressure weakens and damages your blood vessels, which can lead to complications. Types of High Blood Pressure There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure. Primary High Blood Pressure Primary, or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages. Secondary High Blood Pressure Secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. This type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed."},{"prompt":"What causes High Blood Pressure ?","completion":"Changes, either fromgenesor the environment, in the bodys normal functions may cause high blood pressure, including changes to kidney fluid and salt balances, therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,sympathetic nervous systemactivity, and blood vessel structure and function. Biology and High Blood Pressure Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include: Kidney fluid and salt balances Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system Sympathetic nervous system activity Blood vessel structure and function Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure. Sympathetic Nervous System Activity The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure. Blood Vessel Structure and Function Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure. Genetic Causes of High Blood Pressure Much of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. However, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life. Environmental Causes of High Blood Pressure Environmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines. Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including: High dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity Drinking excess amounts of alcohol Lack of physical activity Overweight and Obesity Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure. Medicines Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure. Other Medical Causes of High Blood Pressure Other medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. This happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for High Blood Pressure? ?","completion":"Anyone can develop high blood pressure; however, age, race or ethnicity, being overweight, gender, lifestyle habits, and a family history of high blood pressure can increase your risk for developing high blood pressure. Age Blood pressure tends to rise with age. About 65 percent of Americans age 60 or older have high blood pressure. However, the risk for prehypertension and high blood pressure is increasing for children and teens, possibly due to the rise in the number of overweight children and teens. Race/Ethnicity High blood pressure is more common in African American adults than in Caucasian or Hispanic American adults. Compared with these ethnic groups, African Americans: Tend to get high blood pressure earlier in life. Often, on average, have higher blood pressure numbers. Are less likely to achieve target blood pressure goals with treatment. Overweight You are more likely to develop prehypertension or high blood pressure if youre overweight or obese. The terms overweight and obese refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. Gender Before age 55, men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure. After age 55, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. Lifestyle Habits Unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, and they include: Eating too much sodium or too little potassium Lack of physical activity Drinking too much alcohol Stress Family History A family history of high blood pressure raises the risk of developing prehypertension or high blood pressure. Some people have a high sensitivity to sodium and salt, which may increase their risk for high blood pressure and may run in families. Genetic causes of this condition are why family history is a risk factor for this condition."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of High Blood Pressure ?","completion":"Because diagnosis is based on blood pressure readings, this condition can go undetected for years, as symptoms do not usually appear until the body is damaged from chronic high blood pressure. Complications of High Blood Pressure When blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage the body and cause complications. Some common complications and their signs and symptoms include: Aneurysms:When an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery. Aneurysms develop and grow for years without causing signs or symptoms until they rupture, grow large enough to press on nearby body parts, or block blood flow. The signs and symptoms that develop depend on the location of the aneurysm. Chronic Kidney Disease: When blood vessels narrow in the kidneys, possibly causing kidney failure. Cognitive Changes: Research shows that over time, higher blood pressure numbers can lead to cognitive changes. Signs and symptoms include memory loss, difficulty finding words, and losing focus during conversations. Eye Damage: When blood vessels in the eyes burst or bleed. Signs and symptoms include vision changes or blindness. Heart Attack: When the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart doesnt get oxygen. The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort, upper body discomfort, and shortness of breath. Heart Failure: When the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. Common signs and symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or trouble breathing; feeling tired; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck. Peripheral Artery Disease: A disease in which plaque builds up in leg arteries and affects blood flow in the legs. When people have symptoms, the most common are pain, cramping, numbness, aching, or heaviness in the legs, feet, and buttocks after walking or climbing stairs. Stroke: When the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a portion of the brain is blocked. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden onset of weakness; paralysis or numbness of the face, arms, or legs; trouble speaking or understanding speech; and trouble seeing."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose High Blood Pressure ?","completion":"For most patients, health care providers diagnose high blood pressure when blood pressure readings areconsistently 140/90 mmHg or above. Confirming High Blood Pressure A blood pressure test is easy and painless and can be done in a health care providers office or clinic. To prepare for the test: Dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test. Go to the bathroom before the test. Sit for 5 minutes before the test. To track blood pressure readings over a period of time, the health care provider may ask you to come into the office on different days and at different times to take your blood pressure. The health care provider also may ask you to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of all your results. Whenever you have an appointment with the health care provider, be sure to bring your log of blood pressure readings. Every time you visit the health care provider, he or she should tell you what your blood pressure numbers are; if he or she does not, you should ask for your readings. Blood Pressure Severity and Type Your health care provider usually takes 23 readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure. Using the results of your blood pressure test, your health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if: Your systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than 120/80 mmHg. Your childs blood pressure numbers are outside average numbers for children of the same age, gender, and height. Once your health care provider determines the severity of your blood pressure, he or she can order additional tests to determine if your blood pressure is due to other conditions or medicines or if you have primary high blood pressure. Health care providers can use this information to develop your treatment plan. Some people have white coat hypertension. This happens when blood pressure readings are only high when taken in a health care providers office compared with readings taken in any other location. Health care providers diagnose this type of high blood pressure by reviewing readings in the office and readings taken anywhere else. Researchers believe stress, which can occur during the medical appointment, causes white coat hypertension."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for High Blood Pressure ?","completion":"Based on your diagnosis, health care providers develop treatment plans for high blood pressure that include lifelong lifestyle changes and medicines to control high blood pressure; lifestyle changes such as weight loss can be highly effective in treating high blood pressure. Treatment Plans Health care providers work with you to develop a treatment plan based on whether you were diagnosed with primary or secondary high blood pressure and if there is a suspected or known cause. Treatment plans may evolve until blood pressure control is achieved. If your health care provider diagnoses you with secondary high blood pressure, he or she will work to treat the other condition or change the medicine suspected of causing your high blood pressure. If high blood pressure persists or is first diagnosed as primary high blood pressure, your treatment plan will include lifestyle changes. When lifestyle changes alone do not control or lower blood pressure, your health care provider may change or update your treatment plan by prescribing medicines to treat the disease. Health care providers prescribe children and teens medicines at special doses that are safe and effective in children. If your health care provider prescribes medicines as a part of your treatment plan, keep up your healthy lifestyle habits. The combination of the medicines and the healthy lifestyle habits helps control and lower your high blood pressure. Some people develop resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure. This can happen when the medications they are taking do not work well for them or another medical condition is leading to uncontrolled blood pressure. Health care providers treat resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure with an intensive treatment plan that can include a different set of blood pressure medications or other special treatments. To achieve the best control of your blood pressure, follow your treatment plan and take all medications as prescribed. Following your prescribed treatment plan is important because it can prevent or delay complications that high blood pressure can cause and can lower your risk for other related problems. Healthy Lifestyle Changes Healthy lifestyle habits can help you control high blood pressure. These habits include: Healthy eating Being physically active Maintaining a healthy weight Limiting alcohol intake Managing and coping with stress To help make lifelong lifestyle changes, try making one healthy lifestyle change at a time and add another change when you feel that you have successfully adopted the earlier changes. When you practice several healthy lifestyle habits, you are more likely to lower your blood pressure and maintain normal blood pressure readings. Healthy Eating To help treat high blood pressure, health care providers recommend that you limit sodium and salt intake, increase potassium, and eat foods that are heart healthy. Limiting Sodium and Salt A low-sodium diet can help you manage your blood pressure. You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 mg sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Your health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about the DASH eating plan. Heart-Healthy Eating Your health care provider also may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: Whole grains Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages In the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, which studied Hispanics living in the United States, Cubans ate more sodium and Mexicans ate less sodium than other Hispanic groups in the study. All Hispanic Americans should follow these healthy eating recommendations even when cooking traditional Latino dishes. Try some of these popular Hispanic American heart-healthy recipes. Being Physically Active Routine physical activity can lower high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, spread throughout the week. Read more about physical activity: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 to 5 percent can lower your risk for health problems. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lowerLDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. However, research shows that no matter your weight, it is important to control high blood pressure to maintain good health. A useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI measures your weight in relation to your height. To figure out your BMI, check out NHLBIs online BMI calculator or talk to yourhealth care provider. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30 or more is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to Aim for a Healthy Weight. Limiting Alcohol Intake Limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Managing and Coping With Stress Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health and can lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include: Being physically active Listening to music or focusing on something calm or peaceful Performing yoga or tai chi Meditating Medicines Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to stop or slow some of the bodys functions that cause high blood pressure. Medicines to lower blood pressure include: Diuretics (Water or Fluid Pills): Flush excess sodium from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill. Beta Blockers: Help your heart beat slower and with less force. As a result, your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels, which can help to lower your blood pressure. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure. Calcium Channel Blockers: Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower your blood pressure. Alpha Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down. Alpha-Beta Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses the same way alpha blockers do. However, like beta blockers, they also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down. Central Acting Agents: Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure. Vasodilators: Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure. To lower and control blood pressure, many people take two or more medicines. If you have side effects from your medicines, dont stop taking your medicines. Instead, talk with your health care provider about the side effects to see if the dose can be changed or a new medicine prescribed. Future Treatments Scientists, doctors, and researchers continue to study the changes that cause high blood pressure, to develop new medicines and treatments to control high blood pressure. Possible future treatments under investigation include new combination medicines, vaccines, and interventions aimed at the sympathetic nervous system, such as kidney nerve ablation."},{"prompt":"w to prevent High Blood Pressure ?","completion":"Healthy lifestyle habits, proper use of medicines, and regular medical care can prevent high blood pressure or its complications. Preventing High Blood Pressure Onset Healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent high blood pressure from developing. It is important to check your blood pressure regularly. Children should have their blood pressure checked starting at 3 years of age. If prehypertension is detected, it should be taken seriously to avoid progressing to high blood pressure. Preventing Worsening High Blood Pressure or Complications If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, it is important to obtain regular medical care and to follow your prescribed treatment plan, which will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines. Not only can healthy lifestyle habits prevent high blood pressure from occurring, but they can reverse prehypertension and help control existing high blood pressure or prevent complications and long-term problems associated with this condition, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, or kidney disease."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Metabolic Syndrome ?","completion":"Metabolicsyndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. The term \\"metabolic\\" refers to the biochemical processes involved in the body's normal functioning. Risk factors are traits, conditions, or habits that increase your chance of developing a disease. In this article, \\"heart disease\\" refers to coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque hardens and narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to your heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, a heart attack, heart damage, or even death. Metabolic Risk Factors The five conditions described below are metabolic risk factors. You can have any one of these risk factors by itself, but they tend to occur together. You must have at least three metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. A large waistline. This also is called abdominal obesity or \\"having an apple shape.\\" Excess fat in the stomach area is a greater risk factor for heart disease than excess fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips. A high triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. A low HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \\"good\\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. A low HDL cholesterol level raises your risk for heart disease. High blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure). Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to plaque buildup. High fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat high blood sugar). Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes. Overview Your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke increases with the number of metabolic risk factors you have. The risk of having metabolic syndrome is closely linked to overweight and obesity and a lack of physical activity. Insulin resistance also may increase your risk for metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body cant use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where its used for energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels, and its closely linked to overweight and obesity.Genetics (ethnicity and family history) and older age are other factors that may play a role in causing metabolic syndrome. Outlook Metabolic syndrome is becoming more common due to a rise in obesity rates among adults. In the future, metabolic syndrome may overtake smoking as the leading risk factor for heart disease. It is possible to prevent or delay metabolic syndrome, mainly with lifestyle changes. A healthy lifestyle is a lifelong commitment. Successfully controlling metabolic syndrome requires long-term effort and teamwork with your health care providers."},{"prompt":"What causes Metabolic Syndrome ?","completion":"Metabolic syndrome has several causes that act together. You can control some of the causes, such as overweight and obesity, an inactive lifestyle, and insulin resistance. You can't control other factors that may play a role in causing metabolic syndrome, such as growing older. Your risk for metabolic syndrome increases with age. You also can't control genetics (ethnicity and family history), which may play a role in causing the condition. For example, genetics can increase your risk for insulin resistance, which can lead to metabolic syndrome. People who have metabolic syndrome often have two other conditions: excessive blood clotting and constant, low-grade inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it. Researchers continue to study conditions that may play a role in metabolic syndrome, such as: A fatty liver (excess triglycerides and other fats in the liver) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries) Gallstones Breathing problems during sleep (such as sleep apnea)"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Metabolic Syndrome? ?","completion":"People at greatest risk for metabolic syndrome have these underlying causes: Abdominal obesity (a large waistline) An inactive lifestyle Insulin resistance Some people are at risk for metabolic syndrome because they take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. These medicines most often are used to treat inflammation, allergies, HIV, and depression and other types of mental illness. Populations Affected Some racial and ethnic groups in the United States are at higher risk for metabolic syndrome than others. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by whites and blacks. Other groups at increased risk for metabolic syndrome include: People who have a personal history of diabetes People who have a sibling or parent who hasdiabetes Women when compared with men Women who have a personal history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries) Heart Disease Risk Metabolic syndrome increases your risk for coronary heart disease. Other risk factors, besides metabolic syndrome, also increase your risk for heart disease. For example, a high LDL (bad) cholesterol level and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease. For details about all of the risk factors for heart disease, go to the Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors HealthTopic. Even if you dont have metabolic syndrome, you should find out your short-term risk for heart disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) divides short-term heart disease risk into four categories. Your risk category depends on which risk factors you have and how many you have. Your risk factors are used to calculate your 10-year risk of developing heart disease. The NCEP has an online calculator that you can use to estimate your 10-year risk of having a heart attack. High risk: Youre in this category if you already have heart disease or diabetes, or if your 10-year risk score is more than 20 percent. Moderately high risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is 10 percent to 20 percent. Moderate risk: Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is less than 10 percent. Lower risk: Youre in this category if you have zero or one risk factor. Even if your 10-year risk score isnt high, metabolic syndrome will increase your risk for coronary heart disease over time."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Metabolic Syndrome ?","completion":"Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that raises your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. These risk factors can increase your risk for health problems even if they're only moderately raised (borderline-high risk factors). Most of the metabolic risk factors have no signs or symptoms, although a large waistline is a visible sign. Some people may have symptoms of high blood sugar if diabetesespecially type 2 diabetesis present. Symptoms of high blood sugar often include increased thirst; increased urination, especially at night; fatigue (tiredness); and blurred vision. High blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms. However, some people in the early stages of high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells, or more nosebleeds than usual."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Metabolic Syndrome ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the five metabolic risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic Risk Factors A Large Waistline Having a large waistline means that you carry excess weight around your waist (abdominal obesity). This is also called having an \\"apple-shaped\\" figure. Your doctor will measure your waist to find out whether you have a large waistline. A waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women or 40 inches or more for men is a metabolic risk factor. A large waistline means you're at increased risk for heart disease and other health problems. A High Triglyceride Level Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. A triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high triglycerides) is a metabolic risk factor. (The mg/dL is milligrams per deciliterthe units used to measure triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar.) A Low HDL Cholesterol Level HDL cholesterol sometimes is called \\"good\\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. An HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL for women and less than 40 mg/dL for men (or being on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol) is a metabolic risk factor. High Blood Pressure A blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood pressure) is a metabolic risk factor. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) If only one of your two blood pressure numbers is high, you're still at risk for metabolic syndrome. High Fasting Blood Sugar A normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level between 100125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher is considered diabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood sugar) is a metabolic risk factor. About 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetesthe most common type of diabetesalso have metabolic syndrome. These people have a much higher risk for heart disease than the 15 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Metabolic Syndrome ?","completion":"Heart-healthy lifestyle changes are the first line of treatment for metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, losing and maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity, and quittingsmoking. If lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines. Medicines are used to treat and control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, and high blood sugar. Goals of Treatment The major goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Treatment is directed first at lowering LDL cholesterol and high blood pressure and managing diabetes (if these conditions are present). The second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type2 diabetes, if it hasnt already developed. Long-term complications of diabetes often include heart and kidney disease, vision loss, and foot or leg amputation. If diabetes is present, the goal of treatment is to reduce your risk for heart disease by controlling all of your risk factors. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Heart-Healthy Eating Heart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: If you eat: Try to eat no more than: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Limiting Alcohol Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight If you have metabolic syndrome and are overweight or obese, your doctor will recommend weight loss. He or she can help you create a weight-loss plan and goals. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. Managing Stress Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Regular physical activity can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Quitting Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for heart disease and heart attack and worsen other heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Smoking and Your Heart Health Topic. Medicines Sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your risk factors for metabolic syndrome. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Diabetes Heart disease or had a prior stroke High LDL cholesterol levels Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly. Lower your blood pressure. Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke. Reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms of coronary heart disease. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your risk factors for metabolic syndrome."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Metabolic Syndrome ?","completion":"Making heart-healthy lifestyle choices is the best way to prevent metabolic syndrome by: Being physically active Following a heart-healthy eating plan Knowing your weight, waist measurement, and body mass index Maintaining a healthy weight Make sure to schedule routine doctor visits to keep track of your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. Speak with your doctor about a blood test called a lipoprotein panel, which shows your levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Heart Attack ?","completion":"Espaol A heart attack happens when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart cant get oxygen. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Heart attack treatment works best when its given right after symptoms occur. If you think you or someone else is having a heart attack, even if youre not sure, call 911 right away. Overview Heart attacks most often occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis. Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away. Don't Wait--Get Help Quickly Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort.Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. Upper body discomfort.You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button). Shortness of breath.This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911 If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care. Acting fast can save your life. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment."},{"prompt":"What causes Heart Attack ?","completion":"Coronary Heart Disease A heart attack happens if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart can't get oxygen.

A spasm may be related to: Taking certain drugs, such as cocaine Emotional stress or pain Exposure to extreme cold Cigarette smoking"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Heart Attack? ?","completion":"Certain risk factors make it more likely that you'll develop coronary heart disease (CHD) and have a heart attack. You can control many of these risk factors. Risk Factors You Can Control The major risk factors for a heart attack that you can control include: Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Overweight and obesity An unhealthy diet (for example, a diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium) Lack of routine physical activity High blood sugar due to insulin resistance or diabetes Some of these risk factorssuch as obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugartend to occur together. When they do, it's called metabolic syndrome. In general, a person who has metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes as someone who doesn't have metabolic syndrome. For more information about the risk factors that are part of metabolic syndrome, go to the Health Topics Metabolic Syndrome article. Risk Factors You Can't Control Risk factors that you can't control include: Age. The risk of heart disease increases for men after age 45 and for women after age 55 (or after menopause). Family history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Heart Attack ?","completion":"Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. In one study, for example, one-third of the patients who had heart attacks had no chest pain. These patients were more likely to be older, female, or diabetic. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. It is important for you to know the most common symptoms of a heart attack and also remember these facts: Heart attacks can start slowly and cause only mild pain or discomfort. Symptoms can be mild or more intense and sudden. Symptoms also may come and go over several hours. People who have high blood sugar (diabetes) may have no symptoms or very mild ones. The most common symptom, in both men and women, is chest pain or discomfort. Women are somewhat more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, unusual tiredness (sometimes for days), and pain in the back, shoulders, and jaw. Some people don't have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or with very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. Most Common Symptoms The most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are: Chest pain or discomfort.Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.

Shortness of breath.This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. The symptoms of angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina is chest pain that occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they're active. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Common Signs and Symptoms Pay attention to these other possible symptoms of a heart attack: Breaking out in a cold sweat Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman) Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting Light-headedness or sudden dizziness Any sudden, new symptoms or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual) Not everyone having a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack. Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 911 The signs and symptoms of a heart attack can develop suddenly. However, they also can develop slowlysometimes within hours, days, or weeks of a heart attack. Any time you think you might be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. Call 911 for emergency medical care, even if you are not sure whether you're having a heart attack. Here's why: Acting fast can save your life. An ambulance is the best and safest way to get to the hospital. Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can check how you are doing and start life-saving medicines and other treatments right away. People who arrive by ambulance often receive faster treatment at the hospital. The 911 operator or EMS technician can give you advice. You might be told to crush or chew an aspirin if you're not allergic, unless there is a medical reason for you not to take one. Aspirin taken during a heart attack can limit the damage to your heart and save your life. Every minute matters. Never delay calling 911 to take aspirin or do anything else you think might help."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Heart Attack ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose a heart attack based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results. Diagnostic Tests EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Blood Tests During a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. Higher than normal levels of these proteins suggest a heart attack. Commonly used blood tests include troponin tests, CK or CKMB tests, and serum myoglobin tests. Blood tests often are repeated to check for changes over time. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. This test often is done during a heart attack to help find blockages in the coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through the coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels. If your doctor finds a blockage, he or she may recommend a procedure calledpercutaneous (per-ku-TA-ne-us) coronary intervention (PCI), sometimes referred to ascoronary angioplasty(AN-jee-oh-plas-tee). This procedure can help restore blood flow through a blocked artery. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to help prevent blockages after the procedure."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Heart Attack ?","completion":"Early treatment for a heart attack can prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 911 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital. Immediate Treatment Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include: Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting Nitroglycerin to reduce your hearts workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries Oxygen therapy Treatment for chest pain Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries. Clot-Busting Medicines Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure. Other Treatments for Heart Attack Other treatments for heart attack include: Medicines Medical procedures Heart-healthy lifestyle changes Cardiac rehabilitation Medicines Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines. ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle. Anticlotting medicines. Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel. Anticoagulants. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger. Beta blockers. Beta blockers decrease your hearts workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Statin medicines. Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack orstroke. You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias.Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. Medical Procedures Coronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Treatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend: Heart-healthy eating Maintaining a healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking Taking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack. Heart-Healthy Eating Your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: If you eat: Try to eat no more than: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30 or more is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. Managing Stress Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Routine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent another heart attack. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Quitting Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhandsmoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart. Cardiac Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehab) to help you recover from a heart attack and to help prevent another heart attack. Nearly everyone who has had a heart attack can benefit from rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists. Rehab has two parts: Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future. Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Heart Attack ?","completion":"Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a heart attack. These steps involve following a heart-healthy lifestyle and getting ongoingmedical care. Heart-Healthy Lifestyle A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a heart attack and includes heart-healthy eating, being physically active, quitting smoking, managing stress, and managing your weight. Ongoing Care Treat Related Conditions Treating conditions that make a heart attack more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include: Diabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed. High blood cholesterol. Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise arent enough. High blood pressure. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control. Have an Emergency Action Plan Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a heart attack. This is very important if youre at high risk for, or have already had, a heart attack. Write down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care providers phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card) to share in a medical emergency.

This sac is called the pericardium (per-i-KAR-de-um). The pericardium holds the heart in place and helps it work properly. The sac is made of two thin layers of tissue that enclose your heart. Between the two layers is a small amount of fluid. This fluid keeps the layers from rubbing against each other and causing friction. Pericardium In pericarditis, the layers of tissue become inflamed and can rub against the heart. This causes chest pain, a common symptom of pericarditis. The chest pain from pericarditis may feel like pain from a heart attack. More often, the pain may be sharp and get worse when you inhale, and improve when you are sitting up and leaning forward. If you have chest pain, you should call 911 right away, as you may be having a heart attack. Overview In many cases, the cause of pericarditis is unknown. Viral infections are likely a common cause of pericarditis, although the virus may never be found. Bacterial, fungal, and other infections also can cause pericarditis. Other possible causes include heart attack or heart surgery, other medical conditions, injuries, and certain medicines. Pericarditis can be acute or chronic. \\"Acute\\" means that it occurs suddenly and usually doesn't last long. \\"Chronic\\" means that it develops over time and may take longer to treat. Both acute and chronic pericarditis can disrupt your heart's normal rhythm or function and possibly (although rarely) lead to death. However, most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment. Other times, more intense treatments are needed to prevent complications. Treatments may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery. Outlook It may take from a few days to weeks or even months to recover from pericarditis. With proper and prompt treatment, such as rest and ongoing care, most people fully recover from pericarditis. Proper treatment also can help reduce the chance of getting the condition again."},{"prompt":"What causes Pericarditis ?","completion":"In many cases, the cause of pericarditis (both acute and chronic) is unknown. Viral infections are likely a common cause of pericarditis, although the virus may never be found. Pericarditis often occurs after a respiratory infection. Bacterial, fungal, and other infections also can cause pericarditis. Most cases of chronic, or recurring, pericarditis are thought to be the result of autoimmune disorders. Examples of such disorders include lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis. With autoimmune disorders, the body's immune system makes antibodies (proteins) that mistakenly attack the body's tissues or cells. Other possible causes of pericarditis are: Heart attack and heart surgery Kidney failure, HIV/AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis, and other health problems Injuries from accidents or radiation therapy Certain medicines, like phenytoin (an antiseizure medicine), warfarin and heparin (blood-thinning medicines), and procainamide (a medicine to treat irregular heartbeats)"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Pericarditis? ?","completion":"Pericarditis occurs in people of all ages. However, men aged 20 to 50 are more likely to develop it than others. People who are treated for acute pericarditis may get it again. This may happen in 15 to 30 percent of people who have the condition. A small number of these people go on to develop chronic pericarditis."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Pericarditis ?","completion":"The most common sign of acute pericarditis is sharp, stabbing chest pain. The pain usually comes on quickly. It often is felt in the middle or left side of the chest or over the front of the chest. You also may feel pain in one or both shoulders, the neck, back, and abdomen. The pain tends to ease when you sit up and lean forward. Lying down and deep breathing worsens it. For some people, the pain feels like a dull ache or pressure in the chest. The chest pain also may feel like pain from a heart attack. If you have chest pain, you should call 911 right away, as you may be having a heart attack. Some people with acute pericarditis develop a fever. Other symptoms are weakness, palpitations, trouble breathing, and coughing. (Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast.) The most common symptom of chronic pericarditis is chest pain. Chronic pericarditis also often causes tiredness, coughing, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of chronic pericarditis can lead to swelling in the stomach and legs and hypotension (low blood pressure). Complications of Pericarditis Two serious complications of pericarditis are cardiac tamponade (tam-po-NAD) and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade occurs if too much fluid collects in the pericardium (the sac around the heart). The extra fluid puts pressure on the heart. This prevents the heart from properly filling with blood. As a result, less blood leaves the heart, which causes a sharp drop in blood pressure. If left untreated, cardiac tamponade can be fatal. Chronic constrictive pericarditis is a rare disease that develops over time. It leads to scar-like tissue forming throughout the pericardium. The sac becomes stiff and can't move properly. In time, the scarred tissue compresses the heart and prevents it from working well."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Pericarditis ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose pericarditis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests. Specialists Involved Primary care doctorssuch as a family doctor, internist, or pediatricianoften diagnose and treat pericarditis. Other types of doctors also may be involved, such as a cardiologist, pediatric cardiologist, and an infectious disease specialist. A cardiologist treats adults who have heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist treats children who have heart problems. An infectious disease specialist treats people who have infections. Medical History Your doctor may ask whether you: Have had a recent respiratory infection or flu-like illness Have had a recent heart attack or injury to your chest Have any other medical conditions Your doctor also may ask about your symptoms. If you have chest pain, he or she will ask you to describe how it feels, where it's located, and whether it's worse when you lie down, breathe, or cough. Physical Exam When the pericardium (the sac around your heart) is inflamed, the amount of fluid between its two layers of tissue increases. As part of the exam, your doctor will look for signs of excess fluid in your chest. A common sign is the pericardial rub. This is the sound of the pericardium rubbing against the outer layer of your heart. Your doctor will place a stethoscope on your chest to listen for this sound. Your doctor may hear other chest sounds that are signs of fluid in the pericardium (pericardial effusion) or the lungs (pleural effusion). These are more severe problems related to pericarditis. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend one or more tests to diagnose your condition and show how severe it is. The most common tests are: EKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test detects and records your heart's electrical activity. Certain EKG results suggest pericarditis. Chest x ray. A chest x ray creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The pictures can show whether you have an enlarged heart. This is a sign of excess fluid in your pericardium. Echocardiography. This painless test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart is working. This test can show whether fluid has built up in the pericardium. Cardiac CT (computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee)). This is a type of x ray that takes a clear, detailed picture of your heart and pericardium. A cardiac CT helps rule out other causes of chest pain. Cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. A cardiac MRI can show changes in the pericardium. Your doctor also may recommend blood tests. These tests can help your doctor find out whether you've had a heart attack, the cause of your pericarditis, and how inflamed your pericardium is."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pericarditis ?","completion":"Most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment. Other times, more intense treatment is needed to prevent complications. Treatment may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include: Reducing pain and inflammation Treating the underlying cause, if it's known Checking for complications Specific Types of Treatment As a first step in your treatment, your doctor may advise you to rest until you feel better and have no fever. He or she may tell you to take over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce pain and inflammation. Examples of these medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen. You may need stronger medicine if your pain is severe. If your pain continues to be severe, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine and, possibly, prednisone (a steroid medicine). If an infection is causing your pericarditis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic or other medicine to treat the infection. You may need to stay in the hospital during treatment for pericarditis so your doctor can check you for complications. The symptoms of acute pericarditis can last from a few days to 3 weeks. Chronic pericarditis may last several months. Other Types of Treatment You may need treatment for complications of pericarditis. Two serious complications are cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade is treated with a procedure called pericardiocentesis (per-ih-KAR-de-o-sen-TE-sis). A needle or tube (called a catheter) is inserted into the chest wall to remove excess fluid in the pericardium. This procedure relieves pressure on the heart. The only cure for chronic constrictive pericarditis is surgery to remove the pericardium. This is known as a pericardiectomy (PER-i-kar-de-EK-to-me).

In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). OHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome. Overview To understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange. In people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops. These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. The cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.) Outlook Doctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Other treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.) OHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. OHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment."},{"prompt":"What causes Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?","completion":"Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people.

People who are obese have body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. The most useful measure of obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. You can use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you. If you are obese, you're at greater risk for OHS if your BMI is 40 or higher. You're also at greater risk if most of your excess weight is around your waist, rather than at your hips. This is referred to as \\"abdominal obesity.\\" OHS tends to occur more often in men than women. At the time of diagnosis, most people are 40 to 60 years old."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?","completion":"Many of the signs and symptoms of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) are the same as those of obstructive sleep apnea. This is because many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. One of the most common signs of obstructive sleep apnea is loud and chronic (ongoing) snoring. Pauses may occur in the snoring. Choking or gasping may follow the pauses. Other symptoms include: Daytime sleepiness Morning headaches Memory, learning, or concentration problems Feeling irritable or depressed, or having mood swings or personality changes You also may have rapid, shallow breathing. During a physical exam, your doctor might hear abnormal heart sounds while listening to your heart with a stethoscope. He or she also might notice that the opening to your throat is small and your neck is larger than normal. Complications of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome When left untreated, OHS can cause serious problems, such as: Leg edema, which is swelling in the legs caused by fluid in the body's tissues. Pulmonary hypertension, which is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen. Cor pulmonale, which is failure of the right side of the heart. Secondary erythrocytosis, which is a condition in which the body makes too many red blood cells."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?","completion":"Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is diagnosed based on your medical history, signs and symptoms, and test results. Specialists Involved A critical care specialist, pulmonologist (lung specialist), and/or sleep specialist may diagnose and treat your condition. A sleep specialist is a doctor who diagnoses and treats sleep problems. Examples of such doctors include lung and nerve specialists and ear, nose, and throat specialists. Other types of doctors also can be sleep specialists. Your health care team also may include: A registered dietitian or nutritionist to help you plan and follow a healthy diet. (Your primary care doctor also might oversee weight-loss treatment and progress.) An exercise physiologist or trainer to assess your fitness level and help create a physical activity plan that's safe for you. A bariatric surgeon if weight-loss surgery is an option for you. Medical History and Physical Exam Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms, such as loud snoring or daytime sleepiness. He or she also may ask about your use of alcohol and certain medicines, such as sedatives and narcotics. These substances can worsen OHS. During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope. He or she also will check to see whether another disease or condition could be the cause of your poor breathing. Diagnostic Tests In OHS, poor breathing leads to too much carbon dioxide and too little oxygen in the blood. An arterial blood gas test can measure the levels of these gases in your blood. For this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are measured. Other tests also can measure the carbon dioxide level or oxygen level in your blood. These tests include a serum bicarbonate test and pulse oximetry. A serum bicarbonate test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in the liquid part of your blood, called the serum. For this test, a blood sample is taken from a vein, usually in your wrist or hand. Pulse oximetry measures the level of oxygen in your blood. For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests to help check for conditions and problems related to OHS. Polysomnogram A polysomnogram (PSG) is a type of sleep study. You usually have to stay overnight at a sleep center for a PSG. The test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. A PSG also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, how much air is moving through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether you're making an effort to breathe. Your doctor might use the PSG results to help diagnose sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Lung Function Tests Lung function tests, also called pulmonary function tests, measure how well your lungs work. For example, these tests show: How much air you can take into your lungs. This amount is compared with that of other people your age, height, and sex. This allows your doctor to see whether you're in the normal range. How much air you can blow out of your lungs and how fast you can do it. How well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. The strength of your breathing muscles. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can help rule out other conditions that might be causing your signs and symptoms. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. The results from an EKG might show whether OHS has affected your heart function. Other Tests A complete blood count (CBC) can show whether your body is making too many red blood cells as a result of OHS. A CBC measures many parts of your blood, including red blood cells. A toxicology screen is a group of tests that shows which medicines and drugs you've taken and how much of them you've taken. A blood or urine sample usually is collected for a toxicology screen."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?","completion":"Treatments for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) include breathing support, weight loss, and medicines. The goals of treating OHS may include: Supporting and aiding your breathing Achieving major weight loss Treating underlying and related conditions Breathing Support Positive Airway Pressure Treatment for OHS often involves a machine that provides positive airway pressure (PAP) while you sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. This treatment can help your body better maintain the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. PAP therapy also can help relieve daytime sleepiness. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). CPAP provides continuous mild air pressure to keep your airways open. BiPAP works almost the same, but it changes the air pressure while you breathe in and out. The machines have three main parts: A mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. Straps keep the mask in place while you're wearing it. A tube that connects the mask to the machine's motor. A motor that blows air into the tube. Some machines have other features, such as heated humidifiers. The machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise they make is soft and rhythmic. Some people who have OHS receive extra oxygen as part of their PAP treatment. However, oxygen therapy alone isn't recommended as a treatment for OHS. PAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Many people who have OHS also have this common condition. If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you pick a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Ventilator Support If you have severe OHS that requires treatment in a hospital, you might be put on a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. This machine: Gets oxygen into your lungs Removes carbon dioxide from your body Helps you breathe easier A ventilator blows air, or air with extra oxygen, into the airways through a breathing tube. One end of the tube is inserted into your windpipe, and the other end is hooked to the ventilator. Usually, the breathing tube is put into your nose or mouth and then moved down into your throat. A tube placed like this is called an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube. Endotracheal tubes are used only in a hospital setting. Sometimes the breathing tube is placed through a surgically made hole called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). The hole goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. The procedure to make a tracheostomy usually is done in an operating room. You'll be given medicine so you won't feel any pain. The tracheostomy allows you to be on a ventilator in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home. Talk with your doctor about how long you'll need ventilator support and whether you can receive treatment at home. For more information about ventilator support, go to the Health Topics Ventilator/Ventilator Support article. Weight Loss Your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes. For example, eating fewer calories and being physically active can help you lose weight. Medicines and weight-loss surgery might be an option if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Your doctor will advise you on the best weight-loss treatment for you. For more information about weight loss, go to the treatment section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat OHS (although this treatment is less common than others). Your doctor also may advise you to avoid certain substances and medicines that can worsen OHS. Examples include alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. They can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels. If you're having surgery, make sure you tell your surgeon and health care team that you have OHS. Some medicines routinely used for surgery can worsen your condition."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?","completion":"You can prevent obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) by maintaining a healthy weight. However, not everyone who is obese develops OHS. Researchers don't fully know why only some people who are obese develop the condition. Adopting healthy habits can help you maintain a healthy weight. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. So, it's important to make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, eggs, poultry without skin, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas. A healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). Examples of refined grains include white rice and white bread. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \\"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH\\" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating. To adopt other healthy lifestyle habits, follow these tips: Focus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children's portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion sizes will help you manage your calorie intake. Be physically active. Make personal and family time as active as possible. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run. Reduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames; they cut back on the time for physical activity. Health experts recommend2 hours or less a day of screen time that's not work- or homework-related. Keep track of your weight and body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.

Red blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. These cells carry oxygen to your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. They live for about 120 days in the bloodstream and then die. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infections. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. When blood cells die, the body's bone marrow makes more blood cells to replace them. However, in hemolytic anemia, the bone marrow can't make red blood cells fast enough to meet the body's needs. Hemolytic anemia can lead to many health problems, such as fatigue (tiredness), pain, irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, and heart failure. Overview Hemolytic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \\"anemia\\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. Hemolytic anemia is caused by high rates of red blood cell destruction. Many diseases, conditions, and factors can cause the body to destroy its red blood cells. These causes can be inherited or acquired. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents passed the gene(s) for the condition on to you. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of hemolytic anemia isn't known. Outlook There are many types of hemolytic anemia. Treatment and outlook depend on what type you have and how severe it is. The condition can develop suddenly or slowly. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. Hemolytic anemia often can be successfully treated or controlled. Mild hemolytic anemia may need no treatment at all. Severe hemolytic anemia requires prompt and proper treatment, or it may be fatal. Inherited forms of hemolytic anemia are lifelong conditions that may require ongoing treatment. Acquired forms of hemolytic anemia may go away if the cause of the condition is found and corrected."},{"prompt":"What causes Hemolytic Anemia ?","completion":"The immediate cause of hemolytic anemia is the early destruction of red blood cells. This means that red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their normal lifespan is over.

These causes can be inherited or acquired. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes, the cause of hemolytic anemia isn't known. For more information about the specific causes of hemolytic anemia, go to \\"Types of Hemolytic Anemia.\\" Inherited Hemolytic Anemias In inherited hemolytic anemias, the genes that control how red blood cells are made are faulty. You can get a faulty red blood cell gene from one or both of your parents. Different types of faulty genes cause different types of inherited hemolytic anemia. However, in each type, the body makes abnormal red blood cells. The problem with the red blood cells may involve the hemoglobin, cell membrane, or enzymes that maintain healthy red blood cells. The abnormal cells may be fragile and break down while moving through the bloodstream. If this happens, an organ called the spleen may remove the cell debris from the bloodstream. Acquired Hemolytic Anemias In acquired hemolytic anemias, the body makes normal red blood cells. However, a disease, condition, or other factor destroys the cells. Examples of conditions that can destroy the red blood cells include: Immune disorders Infections Reactions to medicines or blood transfusions Hypersplenism (HI-per-SPLEEN-izm; an enlarged spleen)"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Hemolytic Anemia? ?","completion":"Hemolytic anemia can affect people of all ages and races and both sexes. Some types of hemolytic anemia are more likely to occur in certain populations than others. For example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency mostly affects males of African or Mediterranean descent. In the United States, the condition is more common among African Americans than Caucasians. In the United States, sickle cell anemia mainly affects African Americans."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Hemolytic Anemia ?","completion":"The signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia will depend on the type and severity of the disease. People who have mild hemolytic anemia often have no signs or symptoms. More severe hemolytic anemia may cause many signs and symptoms, and they may be serious. Many of the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia apply to all types of anemia. Signs and Symptoms of Anemia The most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts. A low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, and chest pain. A lack of red blood cells also means that your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. This can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure. Signs and Symptoms of Hemolytic Anemia Jaundice Jaundice refers to a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes. When red blood cells die, they release hemoglobin into the bloodstream. The hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin, which gives the skin and eyes a yellowish color. Bilirubin also causes urine to be dark yellow or brown. Pain in the Upper Abdomen Gallstones or an enlarged spleen may cause pain in the upper abdomen. High levels of bilirubin and cholesterol (from the breakdown of red blood cells) can form into stones in the gallbladder. These stones can be painful. The spleen is an organ in the abdomen that helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells. In hemolytic anemia, the spleen may be enlarged, which can be painful. Leg Ulcers and Pain In people who have sickle cell anemia, the sickle-shaped cells can clog small blood vessels and block blood flow. This can cause leg sores and pain throughout the body. A Severe Reaction to a Blood Transfusion You may develop hemolytic anemia due to a blood transfusion. This can happen if the transfused blood is a different blood type than your blood. Signs and symptoms of a severe reaction to a transfusion include fever, chills, low blood pressure, and shock. (Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs if the body isn't getting enough blood flow.)"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Hemolytic Anemia ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose hemolytic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors, such as a family doctor or pediatrician, may help diagnose and treat hemolytic anemia. Your primary care doctor also may refer you to a hematologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and disorders. Doctors and clinics that specialize in treating inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemias, also may be involved. If your hemolytic anemia is inherited, you may want to consult a genetic counselor. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has the condition. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you. Medical and Family Histories To find the cause and severity of hemolytic anemia, your doctor may ask detailed questions about your symptoms, personal medical history, and your family medical history. He or she may ask whether: You or anyone in your family has had problems with anemia You've recently had any illnesses or medical conditions You take any medicines, and which ones You've been exposed to certain chemicals or substances You have an artificial heart valve or other medical device that could damage your red blood cells Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of hemolytic anemia. He or she will try to find out how severe the condition is and what's causing it. The exam may include: Checking for jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) Listening to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats Listening for rapid or uneven breathing Feeling your abdomen to check the size of your spleen Doing a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Many tests are used to diagnose hemolytic anemia. These tests can help confirm a diagnosis, look for a cause, and find out how severe the condition is. Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. The normal range of these levels may vary in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, a different blood disorder, an infection, or another condition. Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia. Other Blood Tests If the CBC results confirm that you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is. Reticulocyte count. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have hemolytic anemia usually have high reticulocyte counts because their bone marrow is working hard to replace the destroyed red blood cells. Peripheral smear. For this test, your doctor will look at your red blood cells through a microscope. Some types of hemolytic anemia change the normal shape of red blood cells. Coombs' test. This test can show whether your body is making antibodies (proteins) to destroy red blood cells. Haptoglobin, bilirubin, and liver function tests. When red blood cells break down, they release hemoglobin into the bloodstream. The hemoglobin combines with a chemical called haptoglobin. A low level of haptoglobin in the bloodstream is a sign of hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream may be a sign of hemolytic anemia. High levels of this compound also occur with some liver and gallbladder diseases. Thus, you may need liver function tests to find out what's causing the high bilirubin levels. Hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. It can help diagnose the type of anemia you have. Testing for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In PNH, the red blood cells are missing certain proteins. The test for PNH can detect red blood cells that are missing these proteins. Osmotic fragility test. This test looks for red blood cells that are more fragile than normal. These cells may be a sign of hereditary spherocytosis (an inherited type of hemolytic anemia). Testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In G6PD deficiency, the red blood cells are missing an important enzyme called G6PD. The test for G6PD deficiency looks for this enzyme in a sample of blood. Urine Test A urine test will look for the presence of free hemoglobin (a protein that carries oxygen in the blood) and iron. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy. For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. The sample is examined under a microscope to check for faulty cells. A bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. The tissue is examined to check the number and type of cells in the bone marrow. You may not need bone marrow tests if blood tests show what's causing your hemolytic anemia. Tests for Other Causes of Anemia Because anemia has many causes, you may have tests for conditions such as: Kidney failure Lead poisoning Vitamin or iron deficiency Newborn Testing for Sickle Cell Anemia and G6PD Deficiency All States mandate screening for sickle cell anemia as part of their newborn screening programs. Some States also mandate screening for G6PD deficiency. These inherited types of hemolytic anemia can be detected with routine blood tests. Diagnosing these conditions as early as possible is important so that children can get proper treatment."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Hemolytic Anemia ?","completion":"Treatments for hemolytic anemia include blood transfusions, medicines, plasmapheresis (PLAZ-meh-feh-RE-sis), surgery, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and lifestyle changes. People who have mild hemolytic anemia may not need treatment, as long as the condition doesn't worsen. People who have severe hemolytic anemia usually need ongoing treatment. Severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal if it's not properly treated. Goals of Treatment The goals of treating hemolytic anemia include: Reducing or stopping the destruction of red blood cells Increasing the red blood cell count to an acceptable level Treating the underlying cause of the condition Treatment will depend on the type, cause, and severity of the hemolytic anemia you have. Your doctor also will consider your age, overall health, and medical history. If you have an inherited form of hemolytic anemia, it's a lifelong condition that may require ongoing treatment. If you have an acquired form of hemolytic anemia, it may go away if its cause can be found and corrected. Blood Transfusions Blood transfusions are used to treat severe or life-threatening hemolytic anemia. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Medicines Medicines can improve some types of hemolytic anemia, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone, can stop your immune system from, or limit its ability to, make antibodies (proteins) against red blood cells. If you don't respond to corticosteroids, your doctor may prescribe other medicines to suppress your immune system. Examples include the medicines rituximab and cyclosporine. If you have severe sickle cell anemia, your doctor may recommend a medicine called hydroxyurea. This medicine prompts your body to make fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin that newborns have. In people who have sickle cell anemia, fetal hemoglobin helps prevent red blood cells from sickling and improves anemia. Plasmapheresis Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. For this procedure, blood is taken from your body using a needle inserted into a vein. The plasma, which contains the antibodies, is separated from the rest of the blood. Then, plasma from a donor and the rest of the blood is put back in your body. This treatment may help if other treatments for immune hemolytic anemia don't work. Surgery Some people who have hemolytic anemia may need surgery to remove their spleens. The spleen is an organ in the abdomen. A healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells. An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction. Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant In some types of hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemias, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia. A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article. Lifestyle Changes If you have AIHA with cold-reactive antibodies, try to avoid cold temperatures. This can help prevent the breakdown of red blood cells. It's very important to protect your fingers, toes, and ears from the cold. To protect yourself, you can: Wear gloves or mittens when taking food out of the refrigerator or freezer. Wear a hat, scarf, and a coat with snug cuffs during cold weather. Turn down air conditioning or dress warmly while in air-conditioned spaces. Warm up the car before driving in cold weather. People born with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can avoid substances that may trigger anemia. For example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises)."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Hemolytic Anemia ?","completion":"You can't prevent inherited types of hemolytic anemia.

Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. Rh incompatibility can lead to hemolytic anemia in a fetus or newborn."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Thalassemias ?","completion":"Thalassemias (thal-a-SE-me-ahs) are inherited blood disorders. \\"Inherited\\" means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. Thalassemias cause the body to make fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) than normal. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to all parts of the body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from the body to the lungs, where it's exhaled. People who have thalassemias can have mild or severe anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh). Anemia is caused by a lower than normal number of red blood cells or not enough hemoglobin in the red blood cells. Overview Normal hemoglobin, also called hemoglobin A, has four protein chainstwo alpha globin and two beta globin. The two major types of thalassemia, alpha and beta, are named after defects in these protein chains. Four genes (two from each parent) are needed to make enough alpha globin protein chains. Alpha thalassemia trait occurs if one or two of the four genes are missing. If more than two genes are missing, moderate to severe anemia occurs. The most severe form of alpha thalassemia is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. Babies who have this disorder usually die before or shortly after birth. Two genes (one from each parent) are needed to make enough beta globin protein chains. Beta thalassemia occurs if one or both genes are altered. The severity of beta thalassemia depends on how much one or both genes are affected. If both genes are affected, the result is moderate to severe anemia. The severe form of beta thalassemia is known as thalassemia major or Cooley's anemia. Thalassemias affect males and females. The disorders occur most often among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent. Severe forms usually are diagnosed in early childhood and are lifelong conditions. Doctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests. The disorders are treated with blood transfusions, medicines, and other procedures. Outlook Treatments for thalassemias have improved over the years. People who have moderate or severe thalassemias are now living longer and have better quality of life. However, complications from thalassemias and their treatments are frequent. People who have moderate or severe thalassemias must closely follow their treatment plans. They need to take care of themselves to remain as healthy as possible."},{"prompt":"What causes Thalassemias ?","completion":"Your body makes three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets). Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. Hemoglobin also carries carbon dioxide (a waste gas) from your body to your lungs, where it's exhaled. Hemoglobin has two kinds of protein chains: alpha globin and beta globin. If your body doesn't make enough of these protein chains or they're abnormal, red blood cells won't form correctly or carry enough oxygen. Your body won't work well if your red blood cells don't make enough healthy hemoglobin. Genes control how the body makes hemoglobin protein chains. When these genes are missing or altered, thalassemias occur. Thalassemias are inherited disordersthat is, they're passed from parents to children through genes. People who inherit faulty hemoglobin genes from one parent but normal genes from the other are called carriers. Carriers often have no signs of illness other than mild anemia. However, they can pass the faulty genes on to their children. People who have moderate to severe forms of thalassemia have inherited faulty genes from both parents. Alpha Thalassemias You need four genes (two from each parent) to make enough alpha globin protein chains. If one or more of the genes is missing, you'll have alpha thalassemia trait or disease. This means that your body doesn't make enough alpha globin protein. If you're only missing one gene, you're a \\"silent\\" carrier. This means you won't have any signs of illness. If you're missing two genes, you have alpha thalassemia trait (also called alpha thalassemia minor). You may have mild anemia. If you're missing three genes, you likely have hemoglobin H disease (which a blood test can detect). This form of thalassemia causes moderate to severe anemia. Very rarely, a baby is missing all four genes. This condition is called alpha thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. Babies who have hydrops fetalis usually die before or shortly after birth. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Alpha Thalassemia Beta Thalassemias You need two genes (one from each parent) to make enough beta globin protein chains. If one or both of these genes are altered, you'll have beta thalassemia. This means that your body wont make enough beta globin protein. If you have one altered gene, you're a carrier. This condition is called beta thalassemia trait or beta thalassemia minor. It causes mild anemia. If both genes are altered, you'll have beta thalassemia intermedia or beta thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia). The intermedia form of the disorder causes moderate anemia. The major form causes severe anemia.

Ancestry Thalassemias occur most often among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Thalassemias ?","completion":"A lack of oxygen in the bloodstream causes the signs and symptoms of thalassemias. The lack of oxygen occurs because the body doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin. The severity of symptoms depends on the severity of the disorder. No Symptoms Alpha thalassemia silent carriers generally have no signs or symptoms of the disorder. The lack of alpha globin protein is so minor that the body's hemoglobin works normally. Mild Anemia People who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait can have mild anemia. However, many people who have these types of thalassemia have no signs or symptoms. Mild anemia can make you feel tired. Mild anemia caused by alpha thalassemia trait might be mistaken for iron-deficiency anemia. Mild to Moderate Anemia and Other Signs and Symptoms People who have beta thalassemia intermedia have mild to moderate anemia. They also may have other health problems, such as: Slowed growth and delayed puberty. Anemia can slow down a child's growth and development. Bone problems. Thalassemia may cause bone marrow to expand. Bone marrow is the spongy substance inside bones that makes blood cells. When bone marrow expands, the bones become wider than normal. They may become brittle and break easily. An enlarged spleen. The spleen is an organ that helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted material. When a person has thalassemia, the spleen has to work very hard. As a result, the spleen becomes larger than normal. This makes anemia worse. If the spleen becomes too large, it must be removed. Severe Anemia and Other Signs and Symptoms People who have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia major (also called Cooley's anemia) have severe thalassemia. Signs and symptoms usually occur within the first 2years of life. They may include severe anemia and other health problems, such as: A pale and listless appearance Poor appetite Dark urine (a sign that red blood cells are breaking down) Slowed growth and delayed puberty Jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) An enlarged spleen, liver, or heart Bone problems (especially with bones in the face) Complications of Thalassemias Better treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live much longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications of these disorders that occur over time. Heart and Liver Diseases Regular blood transfusions are a standard treatment for thalassemias. Transfusions can cause iron to build up in the blood (iron overload). This can damage organs and tissues, especially the heart and liver. Heart disease caused by iron overload is the main cause of death in people who have thalassemias. Heart disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart attack. Infection Among people who have thalassemias, infections are a key cause of illness and the second most common cause of death. People who have had their spleens removed are at even higher risk because they no longer have this infection-fighting organ. Osteoporosis Many people who have thalassemias have bone problems, including osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). This is a condition in which bones are weak and brittle and break easily."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Thalassemias ?","completion":"Doctors diagnose thalassemias using blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and special hemoglobin tests. A CBC measures the amount of hemoglobin and the different kinds of blood cells, such as red blood cells, in a sample of blood. People who have thalassemias have fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin than normal in their blood. People who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait may have red blood cells that are smaller than normal. Hemoglobin tests measure the types of hemoglobin in a blood sample. People who have thalassemias have problems with the alpha or beta globin protein chains of hemoglobin. Moderate and severe thalassemias usually are diagnosed in early childhood. This is because signs and symptoms, including severe anemia, often occur within the first 2years of life. People who have milder forms of thalassemia might be diagnosed after a routine blood test shows they have anemia. Doctors might suspect thalassemia if a person has anemia and is a member of an ethnic group that's at increased risk for thalassemias. (For more information, go to \\"Who Is at Risk for Thalassemias?\\") Doctors also test the amount of iron in the blood to find out whether the anemia is due to iron deficiency or thalassemia. Iron-deficiency anemia occurs if the body doesn't have enough iron to make hemoglobin. The anemia in thalassemia occurs because of a problem with either the alpha globin or beta globin chains of hemoglobin, not because of a lack of iron. Because thalassemias are passed from parents to children through genes, family genetic studies also can help diagnose the disorder. These studies involve taking a family medical history and doing blood tests on family members. The tests will show whether any family members have missing or altered hemoglobin genes. If you know of family members who have thalassemias and you're thinking of having children, consider talking with your doctor and a genetic counselor. They can help determine your risk for passing the disorder to your children. If you're expecting a baby and you and your partner are thalassemia carriers, you may want to consider prenatal testing. Prenatal testing involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid or tissue from the placenta. (Amniotic fluid is the fluid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo. The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) Tests done on the fluid or tissue can show whether your baby has thalassemia and how severe it might be."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Thalassemias ?","completion":"Treatments for thalassemias depend on the type and severity of the disorder. People who are carriers or who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait have mild or no symptoms. Theyll likely need little or no treatment. Doctors use three standard treatments for moderate and severe forms of thalassemia. These treatments include blood transfusions, iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, and folic acid supplements. Other treatments have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often. Standard Treatments Blood Transfusions Transfusions of red blood cells are the main treatment for people who have moderate or severe thalassemias. This treatment gives you healthy red blood cells with normal hemoglobin. During a blood transfusion, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood. The procedure usually takes 1 to 4 hours. Red blood cells live only for about 120 days. So, you may need repeated transfusions to maintain a healthy supply of red blood cells. If you have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia intermedia, you may need blood transfusions on occasion. For example, you may have transfusions when you have an infection or other illness, or when your anemia is severe enough to cause tiredness. If you have beta thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia), youll likely need regular blood transfusions (often every 2 to 4 weeks). These transfusions will help you maintain normal hemoglobin and red blood cell levels. Blood transfusions allow you to feel better, enjoy normal activities, and live into adulthood. This treatment is lifesaving, but it's expensive and carries a risk of transmitting infections and viruses (for example, hepatitis). However, the risk is very low in the United States because of careful blood screening. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Iron Chelation Therapy The hemoglobin in red blood cells is an iron-rich protein. Thus, regular blood transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the blood. This condition is called iron overload. It damages the liver, heart, and other parts of the body. To prevent this damage, doctors use iron chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body. Two medicines are used for iron chelation therapy. Deferoxamine is a liquid medicine that's given slowly under the skin, usually with a small portable pump used overnight. This therapy takes time and can be mildly painful. Side effects include problems with vision and hearing. Deferasirox is a pill taken once daily. Side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, and tiredness. Folic Acid Supplements Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps build healthy red blood cells. Your doctor may recommend folic acid supplements in addition to treatment with blood transfusions and/or iron chelation therapy. Other Treatments Other treatments for thalassemias have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often. Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are the cells inside bone marrow that make red blood cells and other types of blood cells. A stem cell transplant is the only treatment that can cure thalassemia. But only a small number of people who have severe thalassemias are able to find a good donor match and have the risky procedure. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article. Possible Future Treatments Researchers are working to find new treatments for thalassemias. For example, it might be possible someday to insert a normal hemoglobin gene into stem cells in bone marrow. This will allow people who have thalassemias to make their own healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin. Researchers also are studying ways to trigger a person's ability to make fetal hemoglobin after birth. This type of hemoglobin is found in fetuses and newborns. After birth, the body switches to making adult hemoglobin. Making more fetal hemoglobin might make up for the lack of healthy adult hemoglobin. Treating Complications Better treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications that occur over time. An important part of managing thalassemias is treating complications. Treatment might be needed for heart or liver diseases, infections, osteoporosis, and other health problems."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Thalassemias ?","completion":"You cant prevent thalassemias because theyre inherited (passed from parents to children through genes).

The disorder also is called Fanconis anemia. FA prevents your bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for your body to work normally. FA also can cause your bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer). Although FA is a blood disorder, it also can affect many of your body's organs, tissues, and systems. Children who inherit FA are at higher risk of being born with birth defects. FA also increases the risk of some cancers and other serious health problems. FA is different from Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi syndrome affects the kidneys. It's a rare and serious condition that mostly affects children. Children who have Fanconi syndrome pass large amounts of key nutrients and chemicals through their urine. These children may have serious health and developmental problems. Bone Marrow and Blood Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the large bones of your body. Healthy bone marrow contains stem cells that develop into the three types of blood cells that the body needs: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Red blood cells also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled. White blood cells, which help fight infections. Platelets (PLATE-lets), which help your blood clot. It's normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than 1 day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells. If your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells to replace the ones that die, serious health problems can occur. Fanconi Anemia and Your Body FA is one of many types of anemia. The term \\"anemia\\" usually refers to a condition in which the blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. FA is a type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells. Low levels of the three types of blood cells can harm many of the body's organs, tissues, and systems. With too few red blood cells, your body's tissues won't get enough oxygen to work well. With too few white blood cells, your body may have problems fighting infections. This can make you sick more often and make infections worse. With too few platelets, your blood cant clot normally. As a result, you may have bleeding problems. Outlook People who have FA have a greater risk than other people for some cancers. About 10percent of people who have FA develop leukemia. People who have FA and survive to adulthood are much more likely than others to develop cancerous solid tumors. The risk of solid tumors increases with age in people who have FA. These tumors can develop in the mouth, tongue, throat, or esophagus (eh-SOF-ah-gus). (The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.) Women who have FA are at much greater risk than other women of developing tumors in the reproductive organs. FA is an unpredictable disease. The average lifespan for people who have FA is between 20 and 30 years. The most common causes of death related to FA are bone marrow failure, leukemia, and solid tumors. Advances in care and treatment have improved the chances of surviving longer with FA. Blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the major advance in treatment. However, even with this treatment, the risk of some cancers is greater in people who have FA."},{"prompt":"What causes Fanconi Anemia ?","completion":"Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease. The term inherited means that the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA.

However, you have a 50 percent chance of being an FA carrier and passing the gene to any children you have."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Fanconi Anemia? ?","completion":"Fanconi anemia (FA) occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and affects men and women equally. In the United States, about 1 out of every 181 people is an FA carrier. This carrier rate leads to about 1 in 130,000 people being born with FA. Two ethnic groups, Ashkenazi Jews and Afrikaners, are more likely than other groups to have FA or be FA carriers. Ashkenazi Jews are people who are descended from the Jewish population of Eastern Europe. Afrikaners are White natives of South Africa who speak a language called Afrikaans. This ethnic group is descended from early Dutch, French, and German settlers. In the United States, 1 out of 90 Ashkenazi Jews is an FA carrier, and 1 out of 30,000 is born with FA. Major Risk Factors FA is an inherited diseasethat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. At least 13 faulty genes are associated with FA. FA occurs if both parents pass the same faulty FA gene to their child. Children born into families with histories of FA are at risk of inheriting the disorder. Children whose mothers and fathers both have family histories of FA are at even greater risk. A family history of FA means that it's possible that a parent carries a faulty gene associated with the disorder. Children whose parents both carry the same faulty gene are at greatest risk of inheriting FA. Even if these children aren't born with FA, they're still at risk of being FA carriers. Children who have only one parent who carries a faulty FA gene also are at risk of being carriers. However, they're not at risk of having FA."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Fanconi Anemia ?","completion":"Major Signs and Symptoms Your doctor may suspect you or your child has Fanconi anemia (FA) if you have signs and symptoms of: Anemia Bone marrow failure Birth defects Developmental or eating problems FA is an inherited disorderthat is, it's passed from parents to children through genes. If a child has FA, his or her brothers and sisters also should be tested for the disorder. Anemia The most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its various parts. If you have anemia, you may not have the energy to do normal activities. A low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, and chest pain. Bone Marrow Failure When your bone marrow fails, it can't make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can cause many problems that have various signs and symptoms. With too few red blood cells, you can develop anemia. In FA, the size of your red blood cells also can be much larger than normal. This makes it harder for the cells to work well. With too few white blood cells, you're at risk for infections. Infections also may last longer and be more serious than normal. With too few platelets, you may bleed and bruise easily, suffer from internal bleeding, or have petechiae (pe-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae are tiny red or purple spots on the skin. Bleeding in small blood vessels just below your skin causes these spots. In some people who have FA, the bone marrow makes a lot of harmful, immature white blood cells called blasts. Blasts don't work like normal blood cells. As they build up, they prevent the bone marrow from making enough normal blood cells. A large number of blasts in the bone marrow can lead to a type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Birth Defects Many birth defects can be signs of FA. These include: Bone or skeletal defects. FA can cause missing, oddly shaped, or three or more thumbs. Arm bones, hips, legs, hands, and toes may not form fully or normally. People who have FA may have a curved spine, a condition called scoliosis (sco-le-O-sis). Eye and ear defects. The eyes, eyelids, and ears may not have a normal shape. Children who have FA also might be born deaf. Skin discoloration. This includes coffee-colored areas or odd-looking patches of lighter skin. Kidney problems. A child who has FA might be born with a missing kidney or kidneys that aren't shaped normally. Congenital heart defects. The most common congenital heart defect linked to FA is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). A VSD is a hole or defect in the lower part of the wall that separates the hearts left and right chambers. Developmental Problems Other signs and symptoms of FA are related to physical and mental development. They include: Low birth weight Poor appetite Delayed growth Below-average height Small head size Mental retardation or learning disabilities Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia in Adults Some signs and symptoms of FA may develop as you or your child gets older. Women who have FA may have some or all of the following: Sex organs that are less developed than normal Menstruating later than women who don't have FA Starting menopause earlier than women who don't have FA Problems getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to full term Men who have FA may have sex organs that are less developed than normal. They also may be less fertile than men who don't have the disease."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Fanconi Anemia ?","completion":"People who have Fanconi anemia (FA) are born with the disorder. They may or may not show signs or symptoms of it at birth. For this reason, FA isn't always diagnosed when a person is born. In fact, most people who have the disorder are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 15 years. The tests used to diagnose FA depend on a person's age and symptoms. In all cases, medical and family histories are an important part of diagnosing FA. However, because FA has many of the same signs and symptoms as other diseases, only genetic testing can confirm its diagnosis. Specialists Involved A geneticist is a doctor or scientist who studies how genes work and how diseases and traits are passed from parents to children through genes. Geneticists do genetic testing for FA. They also can provide counseling about how FA is inherited and the types of prenatal (before birth) testing used to diagnose it. An obstetrician may detect birth defects linked to FA before your child is born. An obstetrician is a doctor who specializes in providing care for pregnant women. After your child is born, a pediatrician also can help find out whether your child has FA. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children and teens. A hematologist (blood disease specialist) also may help diagnose FA. Family and Medical Histories FA is an inherited disease. Some parents are aware that their family has a medical history of FA, even if they don't have the disease. Other parents, especially if they're FA carriers, may not be aware of a family history of FA. Many parents may not know that FA can be passed from parents to children. Knowing your family medical history can help your doctor diagnose whether you or your child has FA or another condition with similar symptoms. If your doctor thinks that you, your siblings, or your children have FA, he or she may ask you detailed questions about: Any personal or family history of anemia Any surgeries youve had related to the digestive system Any personal or family history of immune disorders Your appetite, eating habits, and any medicines you take If you know your family has a history of FA, or if your answers to your doctor's questions suggest a possible diagnosis of FA, your doctor will recommend further testing. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures The signs and symptoms of FA aren't unique to the disease. They're also linked to many other diseases and conditions, such as aplastic anemia. For this reason, genetic testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis of FA. Genetic tests for FA include the following. Chromosome Breakage Test This is the most common test for FA. It's available only in special laboratories (labs). It shows whether your chromosomes (long chains of genes) break more easily than normal. Skin cells sometimes are used for the test. Usually, though, a small amount of blood is taken from a vein in your arm using a needle. A technician combines some of the blood cells with certain chemicals. If you have FA, the chromosomes in your blood sample break and rearrange when mixed with the test chemicals. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA. Cytometric Flow Analysis Cytometric flow analysis, or CFA, is done in a lab. This test examines how chemicals affect your chromosomes as your cells grow and divide. Skin cells are used for this test. A technician mixes the skin cells with chemicals that can cause the chromosomes in the cells to act abnormally. If you have FA, your cells are much more sensitive to these chemicals. The chromosomes in your skin cells will break at a high rate during the test. This doesn't happen in the cells of people who don't have FA. Mutation Screening A mutation is an abnormal change in a gene or genes. Geneticists and other specialists can examine your genes, usually using a sample of your skin cells. With special equipment and lab processes, they can look for gene mutations that are linked to FA. Diagnosing Different Age Groups Before Birth (Prenatal) If your family has a history of FA and you get pregnant, your doctor may want to test you or your fetus for FA. Two tests can be used to diagnose FA in a developing fetus: amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). Both tests are done in a doctor's office or hospital. Amniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus. A technician tests chromosomes (chains of genes) from the fluid sample to see whether they have faulty genes associated with FA. CVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. A doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta (the temporary organ that connects the fetus to the mother). The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The tissue sample is sent to a lab to be tested for genetic defects associated with FA. At Birth Three out of four people who inherit FA are born with birth defects. If your baby is born with certain birth defects, your doctor may recommend genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FA. For more information about these defects, go to What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Fanconi Anemia? Childhood and Later Some people who have FA are not born with birth defects. Doctors may not diagnose them with the disorder until signs of bone marrow failure or cancer occur. This usually happens within the first 10 years of life. Signs of bone marrow failure most often begin between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with 7 to 8 years as the most common ages. However, 10 percent of children who have FA aren't diagnosed until after 16 years of age. If your bone marrow is failing, you may have signs of aplastic anemia. FA is one type of aplastic anemia. In aplastic anemia, your bone marrow stops making or doesn't make enough of all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Aplastic anemia can be inherited or acquired after birth through exposure to chemicals, radiation, or medicines. Doctors diagnose aplastic anemia using: Family and medical histories and a physical exam. A complete blood count (CBC) to check the number, size, and condition of your red blood cells. The CBC also checks numbers of white blood cells and platelets. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test counts the number of new red blood cells in your blood to see whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the proper rate. Bone marrow tests. For a bone marrow aspiration, a small amount of liquid bone marrow is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells. For a bone marrow biopsy, a small amount of bone marrow tissue is removed and tested to see whether it's making enough blood cells. If you or your child is diagnosed with aplastic anemia, your doctor will want to find the cause. If your doctor suspects you have FA, he or she may recommend genetic testing. For more information, go to the Health Topics Aplastic Anemia article."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Fanconi Anemia ?","completion":"Doctors decide how to treat Fanconi anemia (FA) based on a person's age and how well the person's bone marrow is making new blood cells. Goals of Treatment Long-term treatments for FA can: Cure the anemia. Damaged bone marrow cells are replaced with healthy ones that can make enough of all three types of blood cells on their own. Or Treat the symptoms without curing the cause. This is done using medicines and other substances that can help your body make more blood cells for a limited time. Screening and Short-Term Treatment Even if you or your child has FA, your bone marrow might still be able to make enough new blood cells. If so, your doctor might suggest frequent blood count checks so he or she can watch your condition. Your doctor will probably want you to have bone marrow tests once a year. He or she also will screen you for any signs of cancer or tumors. If your blood counts begin to drop sharply and stay low, your bone marrow might be failing. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help your body fight infections. In the short term, he or she also may want to give you blood transfusions to increase your blood cell counts to normal levels. However, long-term use of blood transfusions can reduce the chance that other treatments will work. Long-Term Treatment The four main types of long-term treatment for FA are: Blood and marrow stem cell transplant Androgen therapy Synthetic growth factors Gene therapy Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant A blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the current standard treatment for patients who have FA that's causing major bone marrow failure. Healthy stem cells from another person, called a donor, are used to replace the faulty cells in your bone marrow. If you're going to receive stem cells from another person, your doctor will want to find a donor whose stem cells match yours as closely as possible. Stem cell transplants are most successful in younger people who: Have few or no serious health problems Receive stem cells from a brother or sister who is a good donor match Have had few or no previous blood transfusions During the transplant, you'll get donated stem cells in a procedure that's like a blood transfusion. Once the new stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells. A successful stem cell transplant will allow your body to make enough of all three types of blood cells. Even if you've had a stem cell transplant to treat FA, youre still at risk for some types of blood cancer and cancerous solid tumors. Your doctor will check your health regularly after the procedure. For more information about stem cell transplantsincluding finding a donor, having the procedure, and learning about the risksgo to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article. Androgen Therapy Before improvements made stem cell transplants more effective, androgen therapy was the standard treatment for people who had FA. Androgens are man-made male hormones that can help your body make more blood cells for long periods. Androgens increase your red blood cell and platelet counts. They don't work as well at raising your white blood cell count. Unlike a stem cell transplant, androgens don't allow your bone marrow to make enough of all three types of blood cells on its own. You may need ongoing treatment with androgens to control the effects of FA. Also, over time, androgens lose their ability to help your body make more blood cells, which means you'll need other treatments. Androgen therapy can have serious side effects, such as liver disease. This treatment also can't prevent you from developing leukemia (a type of blood cancer). Synthetic Growth Factors Your doctor may choose to treat your FA with growth factors. These are substances found in your body, but they also can be man-made. Growth factors help your body make more red and white blood cells. Growth factors that help your body make more platelets still are being studied. More research is needed on growth factor treatment for FA. Early results suggest that growth factors may have fewer and less serious side effects than androgens. Gene Therapy Researchers are looking for ways to replace faulty FA genes with normal, healthy genes. They hope these genes will make proteins that can repair and protect your bone marrow cells. Early results of this therapy hold promise, but more research is needed. Surgery FA can cause birth defects that affect the arms, thumbs, hips, legs, and other parts of the body. Doctors may recommend surgery to repair some defects. For example, your child might be born with a ventricular septal defecta hole or defect in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. His or her doctor may recommend surgery to close the hole so the heart can work properly. Children who have FA also may need surgery to correct digestive system problems that can harm their nutrition, growth, and survival. One of the most common problems is an FA-related birth defect in which the trachea (windpipe), which carries air to the lungs, is connected to the esophagus, which carries food to the stomach. This can cause serious breathing, swallowing, and eating problems and can lead to lung infections. Surgery is needed to separate the two organs and allow normal eating and breathing."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Fanconi Anemia ?","completion":"ou can't prevent Fanconi anemia (FA) because it's an inherited disease. If a child gets two copies of the same faulty FA gene, he or she will have the disease. If you're at high risk for FA and are planning to have children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has FA. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you. If you're already pregnant, genetic testing can show whether your child has FA. For more information on genetic testing, go to \\"How Is Fanconi Anemia Diagnosed?\\" In the United States, Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of Eastern European descent) are at higher risk for FA than other ethnic groups. For Ashkenazi Jews, it's recommended that prospective parents get tested for FA-related gene mutations before getting pregnant. Preventing Complications If you or your child has FA, you can prevent some health problems related to the disorder. Pneumonia, hepatitis, and chicken pox can occur more often and more severely in people who have FA compared with those who don't. Ask your doctor about vaccines for these conditions. People who have FA also are at higher risk than other people for some cancers. These cancers include leukemia (a type of blood cancer), myelodysplastic syndrome (abnormal levels of all three types of blood cells), and liver cancer. Screening and early detection can help manage these life-threatening diseases."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Atrial Fibrillation ?","completion":"Atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), or AF, is the most common type of arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah). An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. AF occurs if rapid, disorganized electrical signals cause the heart's two upper chamberscalled the atria (AY-tree-uh)to fibrillate. The term \\"fibrillate\\" means to contract very fast and irregularly. In AF, blood pools in the atria. It isn't pumped completely into the heart's two lower chambers, called the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls). As a result, the heart's upper and lower chambers don't work together as they should. People who have AF may not feel symptoms. However, even when AF isn't noticed, it can increase the risk of stroke. In some people, AF can cause chest pain or heart failure, especially if the heart rhythm is very rapid. AF may happen rarely or every now and then, or it may become an ongoing or long-term heart problem that lasts for years. Understanding the Heart's Electrical System To understand AF, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood. Each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the right atrium. In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node sends an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute. (This rate may be slower in very fit athletes.) From the SA node, the electrical signal travels through the right and left atria. It causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down slightly, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood. The electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels to the ventricles. It causes the ventricles to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. The ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node. For more information about the heart's electrical system and detailed animations, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works article. Understanding the Electrical Problem in Atrial Fibrillation In AF, the heart's electrical signals don't begin in the SA node. Instead, they begin in another part of the atria or in the nearby pulmonary veins. The signals don't travel normally. They may spread throughout the atria in a rapid, disorganized way. This can cause the atria to fibrillate. The faulty signals flood the AV node with electrical impulses. As a result, the ventricles also begin to beat very fast. However, the AV node can't send the signals to the ventricles as fast as they arrive. So, even though the ventricles are beating faster than normal, they aren't beating as fast as the atria. Thus, the atria and ventricles no longer beat in a coordinated way. This creates a fast and irregular heart rhythm. In AF, the ventricles may beat 100 to 175 times a minute, in contrast to the normal rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute. If this happens, blood isn't pumped into the ventricles as well as it should be. Also, the amount of blood pumped out of the ventricles to the body is based on the random atrial beats. The body may get rapid, small amounts of blood and occasional larger amounts of blood. The amount will depend on how much blood has flowed from the atria to the ventricles with each beat. Most of the symptoms of AF are related to how fast the heart is beating. If medicines or age slow the heart rate, the symptoms are minimized. AF may be brief, with symptoms that come and go and end on their own. Or, the condition may be ongoing and require treatment. Sometimes AF is permanent, and medicines or other treatments can't restore a normal heart rhythm. The animation below shows atrial fibrillation. Click the \\"start\\" button to play the animation. Written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame. Use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause, restart, or replay the animation, or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames. The animation shows how the heart's electrical signal can begin somewhere other than the sinoatrial node. This causes the atria to beat very fast and irregularly. Outlook People who have AF can live normal, active lives. For some people, treatment can restore normal heart rhythms. For people who have permanent AF, treatment can help control symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes."},{"prompt":"What causes Atrial Fibrillation ?","completion":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs if the heart's electrical signals don't travel through the heart in a normal way. Instead, they become very rapid and disorganized. Damage to the heart's electrical system causes AF. The damage most often is the result of other conditions that affect the health of the heart, such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease. The risk of AF increases as you age. Inflammation also is thought to play a role in causing AF. Sometimes, the cause of AF is unknown."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Atrial Fibrillation? ?","completion":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of people, and the number is rising. Men are more likely than women to have the condition. In the United States, AF is more common among Whites than African Americans or Hispanic Americans. The risk of AF increases as you age. This is mostly because your risk for heart disease and other conditions that can cause AF also increases as you age. However, about half of the people who have AF are younger than 75. AF is uncommon in children. Major Risk Factors AF is more common in people who have: High blood pressure Coronary heart disease (CHD) Heart failure Rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) heart disease Structural heart defects, such as mitral valve prolapse Pericarditis (PER-i-kar-DI-tis; a condition in which the membrane, or sac, around your heart is inflamed) Congenital heart defects Sick sinus syndrome (a condition in which the heart's electrical signals don't fire properly and the heart rate slows down; sometimes the heart will switch back and forth between a slow rate and a fast rate) AF also is more common in people who are having heart attacks or who have just had surgery. Other Risk Factors Other conditions that raise your risk for AF include hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone), obesity, diabetes, and lung disease. Certain factors also can raise your risk for AF. For example, drinking large amounts of alcohol, especially binge drinking, raises your risk. Even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger AF in some people. Caffeine or psychological stress also may trigger AF in some people. Some data suggest that people who have sleep apnea are at greater risk for AF. Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Metabolic syndrome also raises your risk for AF. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. Research suggests that people who receive high-dose steroid therapy are at increased risk for AF. This therapy is used for asthma and some inflammatory conditions. It may act as a trigger in people who have other AF risk factors. Genetic factors also may play a role in causing AF. However, their role isn't fully known."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation ?","completion":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) usually causes the heart's lower chambers, the ventricles, to contract faster than normal. When this happens, the ventricles can't completely fill with blood. Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body. This can lead to signs and symptoms, such as: Palpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast) Shortness of breath Weakness or problems exercising Chest pain Dizziness or fainting Fatigue (tiredness) Confusion Atrial Fibrillation Complications AF has two major complicationsstroke and heart failure. Stroke During AF, the heart's upper chambers, the atria, don't pump all of their blood to the ventricles. Some blood pools in the atria. When this happens, a blood clot (also called a thrombus) can form. If the clot breaks off and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke. (A clot that forms in one part of the body and travels in the bloodstream to another part of the body is called an embolus.) Blood-thinning medicines that reduce the risk of stroke are an important part of treatment for people who have AF. Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Heart Failure Heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. AF can lead to heart failure because the ventricles are beating very fast and can't completely fill with blood. Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body. Fatigue and shortness of breath are common symptoms of heart failure. A buildup of fluid in the lungs causes these symptoms. Fluid also can build up in the feet, ankles, and legs, causing weight gain. Lifestyle changes, medicines, and procedures or surgery (rarely, a mechanical heart pump or heart transplant) are the main treatments for heart failure."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Atrial Fibrillation ?","completion":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is diagnosed based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Sometimes AF doesn't cause signs or symptoms. Thus, it may be found during a physical exam or EKG (electrocardiogram) test done for another purpose. If you have AF, your doctor will want to find out what is causing it. This will help him or her plan the best way to treat the condition. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors often are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of AF. These doctors include family practitioners and internists. Doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease also may be involved, such as: Cardiologists. These are doctors who diagnose and treat heart diseases and conditions. Electrophysiologists. These are cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor will likely ask questions about your: Signs and symptoms. What symptoms are you having? Have you had palpitations? Are you dizzy or short of breath? Are your feet or ankles swollen (a possible sign of heart failure)? Do you have any chest pain? Medical history. Do you have other health problems, such as a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, lung disease, diabetes, or thyroid problems? Family's medical history. Does anyone in your family have a history of AF? Has anyone in your family ever had heart disease or high blood pressure? Has anyone had thyroid problems? Does your family have a history of other illnesses or health problems? Health habits. Do you smoke or use alcohol or caffeine? Physical Exam Your doctor will do a complete cardiac exam. He or she will listen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat and take your pulse and blood pressure reading. Your doctor will likely check for any signs of heart muscle or heart valve problems. He or she will listen to your lungs to check for signs of heart failure. Your doctor also will check for swelling in your legs or feet and look for an enlarged thyroid gland or other signs of hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone). Diagnostic Tests and Procedures EKG An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. It's the most useful test for diagnosing AF. An EKG shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. A standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect AF that doesn't happen during the test. To diagnose paroxysmal AF, your doctor may ask you to wear a portable EKG monitor that can record your heartbeat for longer periods. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors. Holter and Event Monitors A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear small patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect these patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck. You wear the Holter monitor while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG. An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it. For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms. You can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur. Stress Test Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast. Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Echo also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. This test sometimes is called transthoracic (trans-thor-AS-ik) echocardiography. It's painless and noninvasive (no instruments are inserted into the body). For the test, a device called a transducer is moved back and forth over your chest. The device sends special sound waves through your chest wall to your heart. The sound waves bounce off the structures of your heart, and a computer converts them into pictures on a screen. Transesophageal Echocardiography Transesophageal (trans-e-SOF-ah-ge-al) echo, or TEE, uses sound waves to take pictures of your heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach. Your heart's upper chambers, the atria, are deep in your chest. They often can't be seen very well using transthoracic echo. Your doctor can see the atria much better using TEE. During this test, the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube. The tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus. You'll likely be given medicine to help you relax during the procedure. TEE is used to detect blood clots that may be forming in the atria because of AF. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show fluid buildup in the lungs and signs of other AF complications. Blood Tests Blood tests check the level of thyroid hormone in your body and the balance of your body's electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They're essential for normal health and functioning of your body's cells and organs."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Atrial Fibrillation ?","completion":"Treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) depends on how often you have symptoms, how severe they are, and whether you already have heart disease. General treatment options include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes. Goals of Treatment The goals of treating AF include: Preventing blood clots from forming, thus lowering the risk of stroke. Controlling how many times a minute the ventricles contract. This is called rate control. Rate control is important because it allows the ventricles enough time to completely fill with blood. With this approach, the abnormal heart rhythm continues, but you feel better and have fewer symptoms. Restoring a normal heart rhythm. This is called rhythm control. Rhythm control allows the atria and ventricles to work together to efficiently pump blood to the body. Treating any underlying disorder that's causing or raising the risk of AFfor example, hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone). Who Needs Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation? People who have AF but don't have symptoms or related heart problems may not need treatment. AF may even go back to a normal heart rhythm on its own. (This also can occur in people who have AF with symptoms.) In some people who have AF for the first time, doctors may choose to use an electrical procedure or medicine to restore a normal heart rhythm. Repeat episodes of AF tend to cause changes to the heart's electrical system, leading to persistent or permanent AF. Most people who have persistent or permanent AF need treatment to control their heart rate and prevent complications. Specific Types of Treatment Blood Clot Prevention People who have AF are at increased risk for stroke. This is because blood can pool in the heart's upper chambers (the atria), causing a blood clot to form. If the clot breaks off and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke. Preventing blood clots from forming is probably the most important part of treating AF. The benefits of this type of treatment have been proven in multiple studies. Doctors prescribe blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clots. These medicines include warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin. People taking blood-thinning medicines need regular blood tests to check how well the medicines are working. Rate Control Doctors can prescribe medicines to slow down the rate at which the ventricles are beating. These medicines help bring the heart rate to a normal level. Rate control is the recommended treatment for most patients who have AF, even though an abnormal heart rhythm continues and the heart doesn't work as well as it should. Most people feel better and can function well if their heart rates are well-controlled. Medicines used to control the heart rate include beta blockers (for example, metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil), and digitalis (digoxin). Several other medicines also are available. Rhythm Control Restoring and maintaining a normal heart rhythm is a treatment approach recommended for people who aren't doing well with rate control treatment. This treatment also may be used for people who have only recently started having AF. The long-term benefits of rhythm control have not been proven conclusively yet. Doctors use medicines or procedures to control the heart's rhythm. Patients often begin rhythm control treatment in a hospital so that their hearts can be closely watched. The longer you have AF, the less likely it is that doctors can restore a normal heart rhythm. This is especially true for people who have had AF for 6 months or more. Restoring a normal rhythm also becomes less likely if the atria are enlarged or if any underlying heart disease worsens. In these cases, the chance that AF will recur is high, even if you're taking medicine to help convert AF to a normal rhythm. Medicines. Medicines used to control the heart rhythm include amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, and ibutilide. Sometimes older medicinessuch as quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramideare used. Your doctor will carefully tailor the dose and type of medicines he or she prescribes to treat your AF. This is because medicines used to treat AF can cause a different kind of arrhythmia. These medicines also can harm people who have underlying diseases of the heart or other organs. This is especially true for patients who have an unusual heart rhythm problem called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Your doctor may start you on a small dose of medicine and then gradually increase the dose until your symptoms are controlled. Medicines used for rhythm control can be given regularly by injection at a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital. Or, you may routinely take pills to try to control AF or prevent repeat episodes. If your doctor knows how you'll react to a medicine, a specific dose may be prescribed for you to take on an as-needed basis if you have an episode of AF. Procedures. Doctors use several procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm. For example, they may use electrical cardioversion to treat a fast or irregular heartbeat. For this procedure, low-energy shocks are given to your heart to trigger a normal rhythm. You're temporarily put to sleep before you receive the shocks. Electrical cardioversion isn't the same as the emergency heart shocking procedure often seen on TV programs. It's planned in advance and done under carefully controlled conditions. Before doing electrical cardioversion, your doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This test can rule out the presence of blood clots in the atria. If clots are present, you may need to take blood-thinning medicines before the procedure. These medicines can help get rid of the clots. Catheter ablation (ab-LA-shun) may be used to restore a normal heart rhythm if medicines or electrical cardioversion don't work. For this procedure, a wire is inserted through a vein in the leg or arm and threaded to the heart. Radio wave energy is sent through the wire to destroy abnormal tissue that may be disrupting the normal flow of electrical signals. An electrophysiologist usually does this procedure in a hospital. Your doctor may recommend a TEE before catheter ablation to check for blood clots in the atria. Sometimes doctors use catheter ablation to destroy the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node is where the heart's electrical signals pass from the atria to the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers). This procedure requires your doctor to surgically implant a device called a pacemaker, which helps maintain a normal heart rhythm. Research on the benefits of catheter ablation as a treatment for AF is still ongoing. (For more information, go to the \\"Clinical Trials\\" section of this article.) Another procedure to restore a normal heart rhythm is called maze surgery. For this procedure, the surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. These cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals. This procedure requires open-heart surgery, so it's usually done when a person requires heart surgery for other reasons, such as for heart valve disease (which can increase the risk of AF). Approaches To Treating Underlying Causes and Reducing Risk Factors Your doctor may recommend treatments for an underlying cause of AF or to reduce AF risk factors. For example, he or she may prescribe medicines to treat an overactive thyroid, lower high blood pressure, or manage high blood cholesterol. Your doctor also may recommend lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, cutting back on salt intake (to help lower blood pressure), quitting smoking, and reducing stress. Limiting or avoiding alcohol, caffeine, or other stimulants that may increase your heart rate also can help reduce your risk for AF."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Atrial Fibrillation ?","completion":"Following a healthy lifestyle and taking steps to lower your risk for heart disease may help you prevent atrial fibrillation (AF). These steps include: Following a heart healthy diet that's low in saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. A healthy diet includes a variety of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables daily. Not smoking. Being physically active. Maintaining a healthy weight. If you already have heart disease or other AF risk factors, work with your doctor to manage your condition. In addition to adopting the healthy habits above, which can help control heart disease, your doctor may advise you to: Follow the DASH eating plan to help lower your blood pressure. Keep your cholesterol and triglycerides at healthy levels with dietary changes and medicines (if prescribed). Limit or avoid alcohol. Control your blood sugar level if you have diabetes.

Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. Angina isn't a disease; it's a symptom of an underlying heart problem. Angina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is the most common type of heart disease in adults. It occurs if a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up on the inner walls of your coronary arteries. These arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque Buildup in an Artery Plaque narrows and stiffens the coronary arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle, causing chest pain. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow, which can cause a heart attack. Angina also can be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). This is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries. In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't create blockages in the arteries like it does in CHD. Studies have shown that coronary MVD is more likely to affect women than men. Coronary MVD also is called cardiac syndrome X and nonobstructive CHD. Types of Angina The major types of angina are stable, unstable, variant (Prinzmetal's), and microvascular. Knowing how the types differ is important. This is because they have different symptoms and require different treatments. Stable Angina Stable angina is the most common type of angina. It occurs when the heart is working harder than usual. Stable angina has a regular pattern. (Pattern refers to how often the angina occurs, how severe it is, and what factors trigger it.) If you have stable angina, you can learn its pattern and predict when the pain will occur. The pain usually goes away a few minutes after you rest or take your angina medicine. Stable angina isn't a heart attack, but it suggests that a heart attack is more likely to happen in the future. Unstable Angina Unstable angina doesn't follow a pattern. It may occur more often and be more severe than stable angina. Unstable angina also can occur with or without physical exertion, and rest or medicine may not relieve the pain. Unstable angina is very dangerous and requires emergency treatment. This type of angina is a sign that a heart attack may happen soon. Variant (Prinzmetal's) Angina Variant angina is rare. A spasm in a coronary artery causes this type of angina. Variant angina usually occurs while you're at rest, and the pain can be severe. It usually happens between midnight and early morning. Medicine can relieve this type of angina. Microvascular Angina Microvascular angina can be more severe and last longer than other types of angina. Medicine may not relieve this type of angina. Overview Experts believe that nearly 7 million people in the United States suffer from angina. The condition occurs equally among men and women. Angina can be a sign of CHD, even if initial tests don't point to the disease. However, not all chest pain or discomfort is a sign of CHD. Other conditions also can cause chest pain, such as: Pulmonary embolism (a blockage in a lung artery) A lung infection Aortic dissection (tearing of a major artery) Aortic stenosis (narrowing of the hearts aortic valve) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; heart muscle disease) Pericarditis (inflammation in the tissues that surround the heart) A panic attack All chest pain should be checked by a doctor."},{"prompt":"What causes Angina ?","completion":"Underlying Causes Angina usually is a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD). This means that the underlying causes of angina generally are the same as the underlying causes of CHD. Research suggests that CHD starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. These factors include: Smoking High amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood High blood pressure High amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes Plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). Plaque narrows or blocks the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Some plaque is hard and stable and causes the arteries to become narrow and stiff. This can greatly reduce blood flow to the heart and cause angina. Other plaque is soft and more likely to rupture (break open) and cause blood clots. Blood clots can partially or totally block the coronary arteries and cause angina or a heart attack. Immediate Causes Many factors can trigger angina pain, depending on the type of angina you have. Stable Angina Physical exertion is the most common trigger of stable angina. Severely narrowed arteries may allow enough blood to reach the heart when the demand for oxygen is low, such as when you're sitting. However, with physical exertionlike walking up a hill or climbing stairsthe heart works harder and needs more oxygen. Other triggers of stable angina include: Emotional stress Exposure to very hot or cold temperatures Heavy meals Smoking Unstable Angina Blood clots that partially or totally block an artery cause unstable angina. If plaque in an artery ruptures, blood clots may form. This creates a blockage. A clot may grow large enough to completely block the artery and cause a heart attack. For more information, go to the animation in \\"What Causes a Heart Attack?\\" Blood clots may form, partially dissolve, and later form again. Angina can occur each time a clot blocks an artery. Variant Angina A spasm in a coronary artery causes variant angina. The spasm causes the walls of the artery to tighten and narrow. Blood flow to the heart slows or stops. Variant angina can occur in people who have CHD and in those who dont. The coronary arteries can spasm as a result of: Exposure to cold Emotional stress Medicines that tighten or narrow blood vessels Smoking Cocaine use Microvascular Angina This type of angina may be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the hearts smallest coronary arteries. Reduced blood flow in the small coronary arteries may cause microvascular angina. Plaque in the arteries, artery spasms, or damaged or diseased artery walls can reduce blood flow through the small coronary arteries."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Angina? ?","completion":"Angina is a symptom of an underlying heart problem. Its usually a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD), but it also can be a symptom of coronary microvascular disease (MVD). So, if youre at risk for CHD or coronary MVD, youre also at risk for angina. The major risk factors for CHD and coronary MVD include: Unhealthy cholesterol levels. High blood pressure. Smoking. Insulin resistance or diabetes. Overweight or obesity. Metabolic syndrome. Lack of physical activity. Unhealthy diet. Older age. (The risk increases for men after 45 years of age and for women after 55 years of age.) Family history of early heart disease. For more detailed information about CHD and coronary MVD risk factors, visit the Diseases and Conditions Index Coronary Heart Disease, Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors, and Coronary Microvascular Disease articles. People sometimes think that because men have more heart attacks than women, men also suffer from angina more often. In fact, overall, angina occurs equally among men and women. Microvascular angina, however, occurs more often in women. About 70 percent of the cases of microvascular angina occur in women around the time of menopause. Unstable angina occurs more often in older adults. Variant angina is rare; it accounts for only about 2 out of 100 cases of angina. People who have variant angina often are younger than those who have other forms of angina."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Angina ?","completion":"Pain and discomfort are the main symptoms of angina. Angina often is described as pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest. The pain or discomfort usually starts behind the breastbone. Pain from angina also can occur in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. The pain may feel like indigestion. Some people say that angina pain is hard to describe or that they can't tell exactly where the pain is coming from. Signs and symptoms such as nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness also may occur. Women are more likely to feel discomfort in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back. Shortness of breath is more common in older people and those who have diabetes. Weakness, dizziness, and confusion can mask the signs and symptoms of angina in elderly people. Symptoms also vary based on the type of angina you have. Because angina has so many possible symptoms and causes, all chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Chest pain that lasts longer than a few minutes and isn't relieved by rest or angina medicine may be a sign of a heart attack. Call 911 right away. Stable Angina The pain or discomfort: Occurs when the heart must work harder, usually during physical exertion Doesn't come as a surprise, and episodes of pain tend to be alike Usually lasts a short time (5 minutes or less) Is relieved by rest or medicine May feel like gas or indigestion May feel like chest pain that spreads to the arms, back, or other areas Unstable Angina The pain or discomfort: Often occurs at rest, while sleeping at night, or with little physical exertion Comes as a surprise Is more severe and lasts longer than stable angina (as long as 30 minutes) Usually isnt relieved by rest or medicine May get worse over time May mean that a heart attack will happen soon Variant Angina The pain or discomfort: Usually occurs at rest and during the night or early morning hours Tends to be severe Is relieved by medicine Microvascular Angina The pain or discomfort: May be more severe and last longer than other types of angina pain May occur with shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue, and lack of energy Often is first noticed during routine daily activities and times of mental stress"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Angina ?","completion":"The most important issues to address when you go to the doctor with chest pain are: What's causing the chest pain Whether you're having or are about to have a heart attack Angina is a symptom of an underlying heart problem, usually coronary heart disease (CHD). The type of angina pain you have can be a sign of how severe the CHD is and whether it's likely to cause a heart attack. If you have chest pain, your doctor will want to find out whether it's angina. He or she also will want to know whether the angina is stable or unstable. If it's unstable, you may need emergency medical treatment to try to prevent a heart attack. To diagnose chest pain as stable or unstable angina, your doctor will do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms, and ask about your risk factors for and your family history of CHD or other heart diseases. Your doctor also may ask questions about your symptoms, such as: What brings on the pain or discomfort and what relieves it? What does the pain or discomfort feel like (for example, heaviness or tightness)? How often does the pain occur? Where do you feel the pain or discomfort? How severe is the pain or discomfort? How long does the pain or discomfort last? Diagnostic Tests and Procedures If your doctor thinks that you have unstable angina or that your angina is related to a serious heart condition, he or she may recommend one or more tests. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the hearts electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. However, some people who have angina have normal EKGs. Stress Testing During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast. When your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs. A stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as: Abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure Shortness of breath or chest pain Abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity As part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in various parts of your heart. They also can show how well your heart pumps blood when it beats. Chest X Ray A chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure. It also can show signs of lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD. However, a chest x ray alone is not enough to diagnose angina or CHD. Coronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization Your doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) if he or she suspects you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. Cardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. You're awake during the procedure. It usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter. Computed Tomography Angiography Computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) angiography (CTA) uses dye and special x rays to show blood flow through the coronary arteries. This test is less invasive than coronary angiography with cardiac catheterization. For CTA, a needle connected to an intravenous (IV) line is put into a vein in your hand or arm. Dye is injected through the IV line during the scan. You may have a warm feeling when this happens. The dye highlights your blood vessels on the CT scan pictures. Sticky patches called electrodes are put on your chest. The patches are attached to an EKG machine to record your heart's electrical activity during the scan. The CT scanner is a large machine that has a hollow, circular tube in the middle. You lie on your back on a sliding table. The table slowly slides into the opening of the machine. Inside the scanner, an x-ray tube moves around your body to take pictures of different parts of your heart. A computer puts the pictures together to make a three-dimensional (3D) picture of the whole heart. Blood Tests Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may show that you have risk factors for CHD. Your doctor may recommend a blood test to check the level of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. Some studies suggest that high levels of CRP in the blood may increase the risk for CHD and heart attack. Your doctor also may recommend a blood test to check for low levels of hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) in your blood. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps the blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of your body. If your hemoglobin level is low, you may have a condition called anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh)."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Angina ?","completion":"Treatments for angina include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures, cardiac rehabilitation (rehab), and other therapies. The main goals of treatment are to: Reduce pain and discomfort and how often it occurs Prevent or lower your risk for heart attack and death by treating your underlying heart condition Lifestyle changes and medicines may be the only treatments needed if your symptoms are mild and aren't getting worse. If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need medical procedures or cardiac rehab. Unstable angina is an emergency condition that requires treatment in a hospital. Lifestyle Changes Making lifestyle changes can help prevent episodes of angina. You can: Slow down or take rest breaks if physical exertion triggers angina. Avoid large meals and rich foods that leave you feeling stuffed if heavy meals trigger angina. Try to avoid situations that make you upset or stressed if emotional stress triggers angina. Learn ways to handle stress that can't be avoided. You also can make lifestyle changes that help lower your risk for coronary heart disease. One of the most important changes is to quit smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for CHD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\\" Following a healthy diet is another important lifestyle change. A healthy diet can prevent or reduce high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas). It also includes whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A healthy diet also is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBIs Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating. Other important lifestyle changes include: Being physically active. Check with your doctor to find out how much and what kinds of activity are safe for you. For more information, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article. Maintaining a healthy weight. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control CHD risk factors. Taking all medicines as your doctor prescribes, especially if you have diabetes. Medicines Nitrates are the medicines most commonly used to treat angina. They relax and widen blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart, while reducing the hearts workload. Nitroglycerin (NI-tro-GLIS-er-in) is the most commonly used nitrate for angina. Nitroglycerin that dissolves under your tongue or between your cheek and gum is used to relieve angina episodes. Nitroglycerin pills and skin patches are used to prevent angina episodes. However, pills and skin patches act too slowly to relieve pain during an angina attack. Other medicines also are used to treat angina, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral antiplatelet medicines, or anticoagulants (blood thinners). These medicines can help: Lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels Slow the heart rate Relax blood vessels Reduce strain on the heart Prevent blood clots from forming People who have stable angina may be advised to get annual flu shots. Medical Procedures If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need a medical procedure to treat the underlying heart disease. Both angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are commonly used to treat heart disease. Angioplasty opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. During angioplasty, a thin tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow. Angioplasty can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure. During CABG, healthy arteries or veins taken from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. Bypass surgery can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. You will work with your doctor to decide which treatment is better for you. Cardiac Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehab for angina or after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists. Rehab has two parts: Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests. Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to adjust to a new lifestyle and deal with your fears about the future. For more information about cardiac rehab, go to the DCI Cardiac Rehabilitation article. Enhanced External Counterpulsation Therapy Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is helpful for some people who have angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat. EECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina. You typically get 35 1-hour treatments over 7 weeks."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Angina ?","completion":"You can prevent or lower your risk for angina and heart disease by making lifestyle changes and treating related conditions.

Murmurs range from very faint to very loud. Sometimes they sound like a whooshing or swishing noise. Normal heartbeats make a \\"lub-DUPP\\" or \\"lub-DUB\\" sound. This is the sound of the heart valves closing as blood moves through the heart. Doctors can hear these sounds and heart murmurs using a stethoscope. Overview The two types of heart murmurs are innocent (harmless) and abnormal. Innocent heart murmurs aren't caused by heart problems. These murmurs are common in healthy children. Many children will have heart murmurs heard by their doctors at some point in their lives. People who have abnormal heart murmurs may have signs or symptoms of heart problems. Most abnormal murmurs in children are caused by congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. In adults, abnormal heart murmurs most often are caused by acquired heart valve disease. This is heart valve disease that develops as the result of another condition. Infections, diseases, and aging can cause heart valve disease. Outlook A heart murmur isn't a disease, and most murmurs are harmless. Innocent murmurs don't cause symptoms. Having one doesn't require you to limit your physical activity or do anything else special. Although you may have an innocent murmur throughout your life, you won't need treatment for it. The outlook and treatment for abnormal heart murmurs depend on the type and severity of the heart problem causing them."},{"prompt":"What causes Heart Murmur ?","completion":"Innocent Heart Murmurs Why some people have innocent heart murmurs and others do not isn't known. Innocent murmurs are simply sounds made by blood flowing through the heart's chambers and valves, or through blood vessels near the heart. Extra blood flow through the heart also may cause innocent heart murmurs. After childhood, the most common cause of extra blood flow through the heart is pregnancy. This is because during pregnancy, women's bodies make extra blood. Most heart murmurs that occur in pregnant women are innocent. Abnormal Heart Murmurs Congenital heart defects or acquired heart valve disease often are the cause of abnormal heart murmurs. Congenital Heart Defects Congenital heart defects are the most common cause of abnormal heart murmurs in children. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. They change the normal flow of blood through the heart. Congenital heart defects can involve the interior walls of the heart, the valves inside the heart, or the arteries and veins that carry blood to and from the heart. Some babies are born with more than one heart defect. Heart valve problems, septal defects (also called holes in the heart), and diseases of the heart muscle such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are common heart defects that cause abnormal heart murmurs. Examples of valve problems are narrow valves that limit blood flow or leaky valves that don't close properly. Septal defects are holes in the wall that separates the right and left sides of the heart. This wall is called the septum. A hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect. A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect. Hypertrophic (hi-per-TROF-ik) cardiomyopathy (kar-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee) (HCM) occurs if heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the walls of the ventricles (usually the left ventricle) to thicken. The thickening may block blood flow out of the ventricle. If a blockage occurs, the ventricle must work hard to pump blood to the body. HCM also can affect the hearts mitral valve, causing blood to leak backward through the valve. Heart Defects That Can Cause Abnormal Heart Murmurs For more information, go to the Health Topics Congenital Heart Defects article. Acquired Heart Valve Disease Acquired heart valve disease often is the cause of abnormal heart murmurs in adults. This is heart valve disease that develops as the result of another condition. Many conditions can cause heart valve disease. Examples include heart conditions and other disorders, age-related changes, rheumatic (ru-MAT-ik) fever, and infections. Heart conditions and other disorders. Certain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves, such as: Damage and scar tissue from a heart attack or injury to the heart. Advanced high blood pressure and heart failure. These conditions can enlarge the heart or its main arteries. Age-related changes. As you get older, calcium deposits or other deposits may form on your heart valves. These deposits stiffen and thicken the valve flaps and limit blood flow. This stiffening and thickening of the valve is called sclerosis (skle-RO-sis). Rheumatic fever. The bacteria that cause strep throat, scarlet fever, and, in some cases, impetigo (im-peh-TI-go) also can cause rheumatic fever. This serious illness can develop if you have an untreated or not fully treated streptococcal (strep) infection. Rheumatic fever can damage and scar the heart valves. The symptoms of this heart valve damage often don't occur until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever. Today, most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever develops. It's very important to take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes for strep throat, even if you feel better before the medicine is gone. Infections. Common germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart, including the heart valves. This rare but sometimes life-threatening infection is called infective endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis), or IE. IE is more likely to develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve because of heart valve disease. The abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve. The blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve. IE can worsen existing heart valve disease. Other Causes Some heart murmurs occur because of an illness outside of the heart. The heart is normal, but an illness or condition can cause blood flow that's faster than normal. Examples of this type of illness include fever, anemia (uh-NEE-me-eh), and hyperthyroidism. Anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the body has too much thyroid hormone."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Heart Murmur ?","completion":"People who have innocent (harmless) heart murmurs don't have any signs or symptoms other than the murmur itself. This is because innocent heart murmurs aren't caused by heart problems. People who have abnormal heart murmurs may have signs or symptoms of the heart problems causing the murmurs. These signs and symptoms may include: Poor eating and failure to grow normally (in infants) Shortness of breath, which may occur only with physical exertion Excessive sweating with minimal or no exertion Chest pain Dizziness or fainting A bluish color on the skin, especially on the fingertips and lips Chronic cough Swelling or sudden weight gain Enlarged liver Enlarged neck veins Signs and symptoms depend on the problem causing the heart murmur and its severity."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Heart Murmur ?","completion":"Doctors use a stethoscope to listen to heart sounds and hear heart murmurs. They may detect heart murmurs during routine checkups or while checking for another condition. If a congenital heart defect causes a murmur, it's often heard at birth or during infancy. Abnormal heart murmurs caused by other heart problems can be heard in patients of any age. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors usually refer people who have abnormal heart murmurs to cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists for further care and testing. Cardiologists are doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating heart problems in adults. Pediatric cardiologists specialize in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children. Physical Exam Your doctor will carefully listen to your heart or your child's heart with a stethoscope to find out whether a murmur is innocent or abnormal. He or she will listen to the loudness, location, and timing of the murmur. This will help your doctor diagnose the cause of the murmur. Your doctor also may: Ask about your medical and family histories. Do a complete physical exam. He or she will look for signs of illness or physical problems. For example, your doctor may look for a bluish color on your skin. In infants, doctors may look for delayed growth and feeding problems. Ask about your symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath (especially with physical exertion), dizziness, or fainting. Evaluating Heart Murmurs When evaluating a heart murmur, your doctor will pay attention to many things, such as: How faint or loud the sound is. Your doctor will grade the murmur on a scale of 1 to 6 (1 is very faint and 6 is very loud). When the sound occurs in the cycle of the heartbeat. Where the sound is heard in the chest and whether it also can be heard in the neck or back. Whether the sound has a high, medium, or low pitch. How long the sound lasts. How breathing, physical activity, or a change in body position affects the sound. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures If your doctor thinks you or your child has an abnormal heart murmur, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test is done to find the cause of symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain. EKG An EKG (electrocardiogram) is a simple test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. This test is used to detect and locate the source of heart problems. The results from an EKG also may be used to rule out certain heart problems. Echocardiography Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. There are several types of echo, including a stress echo. This test is done both before and after a stress test. During this test, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast. Echo is used to take pictures of your heart before you exercise and as soon as you finish. Stress echo shows whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart (a sign of coronary heart disease)."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Heart Murmur ?","completion":"A heart murmur isn't a disease. It's an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Thus, murmurs themselves don't require treatment. However, if an underlying condition is causing a heart murmur, your doctor may recommend treatment for that condition. Innocent (Harmless) Heart Murmurs Healthy children who have innocent (harmless) heart murmurs don't need treatment. Their heart murmurs aren't caused by heart problems or other conditions. Pregnant women who have innocent heart murmurs due to extra blood volume also don't need treatment. Their heart murmurs should go away after pregnancy. Abnormal Heart Murmurs If you or your child has an abnormal heart murmur, your doctor will recommend treatment for the disease or condition causing the murmur. Some medical conditions, such as anemia or hyperthyroidism, can cause heart murmurs that aren't related to heart disease. Treating these conditions should make the heart murmur go away. If a congenital heart defect is causing a heart murmur, treatment will depend on the type and severity of the defect. Treatment may include medicines or surgery. For more information about treatments for congenital heart defects, go to the Health Topics Congenital Heart Defects article. If acquired heart valve disease is causing a heart murmur, treatment usually will depend on the type, amount, and severity of the disease. Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines can treat symptoms and help delay complications. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve. For more information about treatments for heart valve disease, go to the Health Topics Heart Valve Disease article."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Heart Block ?","completion":"Heart block is a problem that occurs with the heart's electrical system. This system controls the rate and rhythm of heartbeats. (\\"Rate\\" refers to the number of times your heart beats per minute. \\"Rhythm\\" refers to the pattern of regular or irregular pulses produced as the heart beats.) With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper to the lower chambers. As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. Heart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart. Overview Heart block is a type of arrhythmia (ah-RITH-me-ah). An arrhythmia is any problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Some people are born with heart block, while others develop it during their lifetimes. If you're born with the condition, it's called congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart block. If the condition develops after birth, it's called acquired heart block. Doctors might detect congenital heart block before or after a baby is born. Certain diseases that may occur during pregnancy can cause heart block in a baby. Some congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects. Acquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. Damage to the heart muscle or its electrical system causes acquired heart block. Diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause this damage. The three types of heart block are first degree, second degree, and third degree. First degree is the least severe, and third degree is the most severe. This is true for both congenital and acquired heart block. Doctors use a test called an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. It maps the data on a graph for the doctor to review. Outlook The symptoms and severity of heart block depend on which type you have. First-degree heart block may not cause any severe symptoms. Second-degree heart block may result in the heart skipping a beat or beats. This type of heart block also can make you feel dizzy or faint. Third-degree heart block limits the heart's ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This type of heart block may cause fatigue (tiredness), dizziness, and fainting. Third-degree heart block requires prompt treatment because it can be fatal. A medical device called a pacemaker is used to treat third-degree heart block and some cases of second-degree heart block. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. Pacemakers typically are not used to treat first-degree heart block. All types of heart block may increase your risk for other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fih-brih-LA-shun). Talk with your doctor to learn more about the signs and symptoms of arrhythmias."},{"prompt":"What causes Heart Block ?","completion":"Heart block has many causes. Some people are born with the disorder (congenital), while others develop it during their lifetimes (acquired). Congenital Heart Block One form of congenital heart block occurs in babies whose mothers have autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. People who have these diseases make proteins called antibodies that attack and damage the body's tissues or cells. In pregnant women, antibodies can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These proteins can damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block. Congenital heart defects also may cause congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Often, doctors don't know what causes these defects. Acquired Heart Block Many factors can cause acquired heart block. Examples include: Damage to the heart from a heart attack. This is the most common cause of acquired heart block. Coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. Myocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis), or inflammation of the heart muscle. Heart failure. Rheumatic (roo-MAT-ik) fever. Cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-a-the), or heart muscle diseases. Other diseases may increase the risk of heart block. Examples include sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DOE-sis) and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Certain types of surgery also may damage the heart's electrical system and lead to heart block. Exposure to toxic substances and taking certain medicinesincluding digitalis, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockersalso may cause heart block. Doctors closely watch people who are taking these medicines for signs of problems. Some types of heart block have been linked to genetic mutations (changes in the genes). An overly active vagus nerve also can cause heart block. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate. In some cases, acquired heart block may go away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery. Also, if a medicine is causing heart block, the disorder may go away if the medicine is stopped or the dosage is lowered. Always talk with your doctor before you change the way you take your medicines."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Heart Block? ?","completion":"The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different. Congenital Heart Block If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. Autoimmune diseases can cause the body to make proteins called antibodies that can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These antibodies may damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block. Congenital heart defects also can cause heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes congenital heart defects. Heredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect might be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition. Acquired Heart Block Acquired heart block can occur in people of any age. However, most types of the condition are more common in older people. This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people. People who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are at increased risk for heart block. Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases). Other diseases also may raise the risk of heart block, such as sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease. Exposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis, also can raise your risk for heart block. Well-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Heart Block ?","completion":"Signs and symptoms depend on the type of heart block you have.

If these symptoms are new or severe, call 911 or have someone drive you to the hospital emergency room. If you have milder symptoms, talk with your doctor right away to find out whether you need prompt treatment."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Heart Block ?","completion":"Heart block might be diagnosed as part of a routine doctor's visit or during an emergency situation. (Third-degree heart block often is an emergency.) Your doctor will diagnose heart block based on your family and medical histories, a physical exam, and test results. Specialists Involved Your primary care doctor might be involved in diagnosing heart block. However, if you have the condition, you might need to see a heart specialist. Heart specialists include: Cardiologists (doctors who diagnose and treat adults who have heart problems) Pediatric cardiologists (doctors who diagnose and treat babies and children who have heart problems) Electrophysiologists (cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists who specialize in the heart's electrical system) Family and Medical Histories Your doctor may ask whether: You have any signs or symptoms of heart block You have any health problems, such as heart disease Any of your family members have been diagnosed with heart block or other health problems You're taking any medicines, including herbal products and prescription and over-the-counter medicines You smoke or use alcohol or drugs Your doctor also may ask about other health habits, such as how physically active you are. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart. He or she will listen carefully for abnormal rhythms or heart murmurs (extra or unusual sounds heard during heartbeats). Your doctor also may: Check your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating Check for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure Look for signs of other diseases that could be causing heart rate or rhythm problems (such as coronary heart disease) Diagnostic Tests and Procedures EKG (Electrocardiogram) Doctors usually use an EKG (electrocardiogram) to help diagnose heart block. This simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). The test also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. The data are recorded on a graph. Different types of heart block have different patterns on the graph. (For more information, go to \\"Types of Heart Block.\\") A standard EKG only records the heart's activity for a few seconds. To diagnose heart rhythm problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors. Your doctor may have you use one of these monitors to diagnose first- or second-degree heart block. Holter and Event Monitors A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG. An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it. You may wear an event monitor for 1 to 2 months, or as long as it takes to get a recording of your heart during symptoms. Electrophysiology Study For some cases of heart block, doctors may do electrophysiology studies (EPS). During this test, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records your heart's electrical signals. Other Tests To diagnose heart block, your doctor may recommend tests to rule out other types of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).

If you have third-degree heart block, you will need a pacemaker. In an emergency, a temporary pacemaker might be used until you can get a long-term device. Most people who have third-degree heart block need pacemakers for the rest of their lives. Some people who have third-degree congenital heart block don't need pacemakers for many years. Others may need pacemakers at a young age or during infancy. If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. If heart block is detected in a fetus, the mother might be given medicine to reduce the fetus' risk of developing serious heart block.

Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7million of these people are children. Overview To understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances. When the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways. This chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed. Asthma Sometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse. When symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns). Treating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal. Outlook Asthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. However, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma. If you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers."},{"prompt":"What causes Asthma ?","completion":"The exact cause of asthma isn't known. Researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma, most often early in life. These factors include: An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy (AT-o-pe) Parents who have asthma Certain respiratory infections during childhood Contact with some airborne allergens or exposure to some viral infections in infancy or in early childhood when the immune system is developing If asthma or atopy runs in your family, exposure to irritants (for example, tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air. Some factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others. Researchers continue to explore what causes asthma. The \\"Hygiene Hypothesis\\" One theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the \\"hygiene hypothesis.\\" They believe that our Western lifestylewith its emphasis on hygiene and sanitationhas resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood. Many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past. This affects the way that young children's immune systems develop during very early childhood, and it may increase their risk for atopy and asthma. This is especially true for children who have close family members with one or both of these conditions."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Asthma? ?","completion":"Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 22 million people are known to have asthma. Nearly 6 million of these people are children. Young children who often wheeze and have respiratory infectionsas well as certain other risk factorsare at highest risk of developing asthma that continues beyond 6 years of age. The other risk factors include having allergies, eczema (an allergic skin condition), or parents who have asthma. Among children, more boys have asthma than girls. But among adults, more women have the disease than men. It's not clear whether or how sex and sex hormones play a role in causing asthma. Most, but not all, people who have asthma have allergies. Some people develop asthma because of contact with certain chemical irritants or industrial dusts in the workplace. This type of asthma is called occupational asthma."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Asthma ?","completion":"Common signs and symptoms of asthma include: Coughing. Coughing from asthma often is worse at night or early in the morning, making it hard to sleep. Wheezing. Wheezing is a whistling or squeaky sound that occurs when you breathe. Chest tightness. This may feel like something is squeezing or sitting on your chest. Shortness of breath. Some people who have asthma say they can't catch their breath or they feel out of breath. You may feel like you can't get air out of your lungs. Not all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Likewise, having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. The best way to diagnose asthma for certain is to use a lung function test, a medical history (including type and frequency of symptoms), and a physical exam. The types of asthma symptoms you have, how often they occur, and how severe they are may vary over time. Sometimes your symptoms may just annoy you. Other times, they may be troublesome enough to limit your daily routine. Severe symptoms can be fatal. It's important to treat symptoms when you first notice them so they don't become severe. With proper treatment, most people who have asthma can expect to have few, if any, symptoms either during the day or at night. What Causes Asthma Symptoms To Occur? Many things can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms. Your doctor will help you find out which things (sometimes called triggers) may cause your asthma to flare up if you come in contact with them. Triggers may include: Allergens from dust, animal fur, cockroaches, mold, and pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers Irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, chemicals or dust in the workplace, compounds in home dcor products, and sprays (such as hairspray) Medicines such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and nonselective beta-blockers Sulfites in foods and drinks Viral upper respiratory infections, such as colds Physical activity, including exercise Other health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. Examples of these conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. These conditions need treatment as part of an overall asthma care plan. Asthma is different for each person. Some of the triggers listed above may not affect you. Other triggers that do affect you may not be on the list. Talk with your doctor about the things that seem to make your asthma worse."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Asthma ?","completion":"Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthmathat is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on. You may need to see an asthma specialist if: You need special tests to help diagnose asthma You've had a life-threatening asthma attack You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled You're thinking about getting allergy treatments Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to \\"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\\" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 46 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Asthma ?","completion":"Asthma is a long-term disease that has no cure. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease. Good asthma control will: Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath Reduce your need for quick-relief medicines (see below) Help you maintain good lung function Let you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night Prevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay To control asthma, partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your child's asthma. Children aged 10 or olderand younger children who are ableshould take an active role in their asthma care. Taking an active role to control your asthma involves: Working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management. Avoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active. Working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan. An asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity), tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening symptoms, and seeking emergency care when needed. Asthma is treated with two types of medicines: long-term control and quick-relief medicines. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quick-relief, or \\"rescue,\\" medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks. Your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home, school, or work environments. These changes can alter how often you're exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma. Your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn't stay under control. On the other hand, if your asthma is well controlled for several months, your doctor may decrease your medicine. These adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary. Asthma treatment for certain groups of peoplesuch as children, pregnant women, or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptomswill be adjusted to meet their special needs. Follow an Asthma Action Plan You can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan. The plan will describe your daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when to take them. The plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. If your child has asthma, all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child's asthma action plan. This includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers, schools, and camps. These caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan. Go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \\"Asthma Action Plan\\" for a sample plan. Avoid Things That Can Worsen Your Asthma Many common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Once you know what these things are, you can take steps to control many of them. (For more information about asthma triggers, go to \\"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\\") For example, exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse. If so, try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high. If animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms, keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom. One possible asthma trigger you shouldnt avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active. The NHLBI offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers. For more information, go to page 2 of NHLBI's \\"Asthma Action Plan.\\" If your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens, and you can't avoid exposure to those allergens, your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots. You may need to see a specialist if you're thinking about getting allergy shots. These shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms, but they can't cure your asthma. Several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. These conditions include runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Your doctor will treat these conditions as well. Medicines Your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you. He or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you. Then, he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed. Asthma medicines can be taken in pill form, but most are taken using a device called an inhaler. An inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs. Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit. Long-Term Control Medicines Most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms. The most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting. These medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma. They're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances. Reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur. Inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed. These medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. Inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them every day for many years. Like many other medicines, though, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. Most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects. One common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush. You might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush. These devices attach to your inhaler. They help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat. Check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have. Also, work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber. Rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush. If you have severe asthma, you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control. If taken for long periods, these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). A cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids. Or, your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D pills to protect your bones. Other long-term control medicines. Other long-term control medicines include: Cromolyn. This medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer. As you breathe in, the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs. Cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation. Omalizumab (anti-IgE). This medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month. It helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites. Anti-IgE might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well. A rare, but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the Omalizumab injection is given. If you take this medication, work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you should take. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists. These medicines open the airways. They might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control. They must used with inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene modifiers. These medicines are taken by mouth. They help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways. Theophylline. This medicine is taken by mouth. Theophylline helps open the airways. If your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine, take it every day to control your asthma. Your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine. Long-term control medicines can have side effects. Talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them. With some medicines, like theophylline, your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood. This helps ensure that youre getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms, but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects. Quick-Relief Medicines All people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief. These medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup. This allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them. You should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms. If you use this medicine more than 2 days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your asthma action plan. Carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it. If your child has asthma, make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines, including staff at the child's school. They should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child. You shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation. Track Your Asthma To track your asthma, keep records of your symptoms, check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter, and get regular asthma checkups. Record Your Symptoms You can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma. Asthma is well controlled if: You have symptoms no more than 2 days a week, and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month. You can do all your normal activities. You take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week. You have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth. Your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number. If your asthma isn't well controlled, contact your doctor. He or she may need to change your asthma action plan. Use a Peak Flow Meter This small, hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs. You blow into the device and it gives you a score, or peak flow number. Your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test. Your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter. He or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score. Your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results. You may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you. When you're first diagnosed with asthma, it's important to find your \\"personal best\\" peak flow number. To do this, you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled. The highest number you get during that time is your personal best. You can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled. Your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. If your score shows that your breathing is getting worse, you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs. Then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked. Get Asthma Checkups When you first begin treatment, you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks. Once your asthma is controlled, your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year. During these checkups, your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements. He or she also may ask about your daily activities. This information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control. Your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan. Based on your answers to these questions, your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine. If your control is very good, you might be able to take less medicine. The goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma. Emergency Care Most people who have asthma, including many children, can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans. However, you might need medical attention at times. Call your doctor for advice if: Your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack. Your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number. Call 911 for emergency care if: You have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath. You have blue lips or fingernails. At the hospital, you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines, as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home. Such treatment can save your life. Asthma Treatment for Special Groups The treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma. However, some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs. Children It's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years. Thus, it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines. (Quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not.) Doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if, after assessing a child, they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age. (For more information, go to \\"How Is Asthma Diagnosed?\\") Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children. Montelukast and cromolyn are other options. Treatment might be given for a trial period of 1month to 6 weeks. Treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly. Inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages. Slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment, is generally small, and doesn't get worse over time. Poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate. Many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth. Older Adults Doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines, such as beta blockers, aspirin and other pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines. Older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids, especially at high doses. Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D pills, as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong. Pregnant Women Pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies. Poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia, a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight. Studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack. Talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant. Your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed. People Whose Asthma Symptoms Occur With Physical Activity Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Adults need physical activity to maintain good health. Children need it for growth and development. In some people, however, physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms. If this happens to you or your child, talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active. The following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity: Short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them. Long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours. However, with daily use, they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection. Also, frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled. Leukotriene modifiers. These pills are taken several hours before physical activity. They can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity. Long-term control medicines. Frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation. This will help prevent exercise-related symptoms. Easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful. You also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather. If you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs, you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose. People Having Surgery Asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack. Tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her. The surgeon can take steps to lower your risk, such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Asthma ?","completion":"You cant prevent asthma. However, you can take steps to control the disease and prevent its symptoms. For example: Learn about your asthma and ways to control it. Follow your written asthma action plan. (For a sample plan, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \\"Asthma Action Plan.\\") Use medicines as your doctor prescribes. Identify and try to avoid things that make your asthma worse (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active. Keep track of your asthma symptoms and level of control. Get regular checkups for your asthma. For more details about how to prevent asthma symptoms and attacks, go to \\"How Is Asthma Treated and Controlled?\\""},{"prompt":"What is (are) Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?","completion":"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a heart problem that occurs soon after birth in some babies. In PDA, abnormal blood flow occurs between two of the major arteries connected to the heart. Before birth, the two major arteriesthe aorta and the pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) arteryare connected by a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus. This vessel is an essential part of fetal blood circulation. Within minutes or up to a few days after birth, the vessel is supposed to close as part of the normal changes occurring in the baby's circulation. In some babies, however, the ductus arteriosus remains open (patent). This opening allows oxygen-rich blood from the aorta to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the pulmonary artery. This can put strain on the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries. Normal Heart and Heart With Patent Ductus Arteriosus Go to the \\"How the Heart Works\\" section of this article for more details about how a normal heart works compared with a heart that has PDA. Overview PDA is a type of congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defect. A congenital heart defect is any type of heart problem that's present at birth. If your baby has a PDA but an otherwise normal heart, the PDA may shrink and go away. However, some children need treatment to close their PDAs. Some children who have PDAs are given medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open. For example, this may be done if a child is born with another heart defect that decreases blood flow to the lungs or the rest of the body. Keeping the PDA open helps maintain blood flow and oxygen levels until doctors can do surgery to correct the other heart defect. Outlook PDA is a fairly common congenital heart defect in the United States. Although the condition can affect full-term infants, it's more common in premature infants. On average, PDA occurs in about 8 out of every 1,000 premature babies, compared with 2out of every 1,000 full-term babies. Premature babies also are more vulnerable to the effects of PDA. PDA is twice as common in girls as it is in boys. Doctors treat the condition with medicines, catheter-based procedures, and surgery. Most children who have PDAs live healthy, normal lives after treatment."},{"prompt":"What causes Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?","completion":"If your child has patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), you may think you did something wrong during your pregnancy to cause the problem. However, the cause of patent ductus arteriosus isn't known. Genetics may play a role in causing the condition. A defect in one or more genes might prevent the ductus arteriosus from closing after birth."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Patent Ductus Arteriosus? ?","completion":"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a relatively common congenital heart defect in the United States. The condition occurs more often in premature infants (on average, occurring in about 8 of every 1,000 births). However, PDA also occurs in full-term infants (on average, occurring in about 2 of every 1,000 births). PDA also is more common in: Infants who have genetic conditions such as Down syndrome Infants whose mothers had German measles (rubella) during pregnancy PDA is twice as common in girls as it is in boys."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?","completion":"A heart murmur may be the only sign that a baby has patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Heart murmurs also have other causes besides PDA, and most murmurs are harmless. Some infants may develop signs or symptoms of volume overload on the heart and excess blood flow in the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include: Fast breathing, working hard to breathe, or shortness of breath. Premature infants may need increased oxygen or help breathing from a ventilator. Poor feeding and poor weight gain. Tiring easily. Sweating with exertion, such as while feeding."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?","completion":"In full-term infants, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) usually is first suspected when the baby's doctor hears a heart murmur during a regular checkup. A heart murmur is an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Heart murmurs also have other causes besides PDA, and most murmurs are harmless. If a PDA is large, the infant also may develop symptoms of volume overload and increased blood flow to the lungs. If a PDA is small, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood. If your child's doctor thinks your child has PDA, he or she may refer you to a pediatric cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems in children. Premature babies who have PDA may not have the same signs as full-term babies, such as heart murmurs. Doctors may suspect PDA in premature babies who develop breathing problems soon after birth. Tests can help confirm a diagnosis. Diagnostic Tests Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your baby's heart. During echo, the sound waves bounce off your childs heart. A computer converts the sound waves into pictures of the hearts structures. The test allows the doctor to clearly see any problems with the way the heart is formed or the way it's working. Echo is the most important test available to your baby's cardiologist to both diagnose a heart problem and follow the problem over time. In babies who have PDA, echo shows how big the PDA is and how well the heart is responding to it. When medical treatments are used to try to close a PDA, echo is used to see how well the treatments are working. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. For babies who have PDA, an EKG can show whether the heart is enlarged. The test also can show other subtle changes that can suggest the presence of a PDA."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?","completion":"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is treated with medicines, catheter-based procedures, and surgery. The goal of treatment is to close the PDA. Closure will help prevent complications and reverse the effects of increased blood volume. Small PDAs often close without treatment. For full-term infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is large or causing health problems. For premature infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is causing breathing problems or heart problems. Talk with your child's doctor about treatment options and how your family prefers to handle treatment decisions. Medicines Your child's doctor may prescribe medicines to help close your child's PDA. Indomethacin (in-doh-METH-ah-sin) is a medicine that helps close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine triggers the PDA to constrict or tighten, which closes the opening. Indomethacin usually doesn't work in full-term infants. Ibuprofen also is used to close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine is similar to indomethacin. Catheter-Based Procedures Catheters are thin, flexible tubes that doctors use as part of a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Catheter-based procedures often are used to close PDAs in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure. Your child's doctor may refer to the procedure as \\"transcatheter device closure.\\" The procedure sometimes is used for small PDAs to prevent the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Your child will be given medicine to help him or her relax or sleep during the procedure. The doctor will insert a catheter in a large blood vessel in the groin (upper thigh). He or she will then guide the catheter to your child's heart. A small metal coil or other blocking device is passed through the catheter and placed in the PDA. This device blocks blood flow through the vessel. Catheter-based procedures don't require the child's chest to be opened. They also allow the child to recover quickly. These procedures often are done on an outpatient basis. You'll most likely be able to take your child home the same day the procedure is done. Complications from catheter-based procedures are rare and short term. They can include bleeding, infection, and movement of the blocking device from where it was placed. Surgery Surgery to correct a PDA may be done if: A premature or full-term infant has health problems due to a PDA and is too small to have a catheter-based procedure A catheter-based procedure doesn't successfully close the PDA Surgery is planned for treatment of related congenital heart defects Often, surgery isn't done until after 6 months of age in infants who don't have health problems from their PDAs. Doctors sometimes do surgery on small PDAs to prevent the risk of IE. For the surgery, your child will be given medicine so that he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. The surgeon will make a small incision (cut) between your child's ribs to reach the PDA. He or she will close the PDA using stitches or clips. Complications from surgery are rare and usually short term. They can include hoarseness, a paralyzed diaphragm (the muscle below the lungs), infection, bleeding, or fluid buildup around the lungs. After Surgery After surgery, your child will spend a few days in the hospital. He or she will be given medicine to reduce pain and anxiety. Most children go home 2 days after surgery. Premature infants usually have to stay in the hospital longer because of their other health issues. The doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home. They will talk to you about: Limits on activity for your child while he or she recovers Followup appointments with your child's doctors How to give your child medicines at home, if needed When your child goes home after surgery, you can expect that he or she will feel fairly comfortable. However, you child may have some short-term pain. Your child should begin to eat better and gain weight quickly. Within a few weeks, he or she should fully recover and be able to take part in normal activities. Long-term complications from surgery are rare. However, they can include narrowing of the aorta, incomplete closure of the PDA, and reopening of the PDA."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Sickle Cell Disease ?","completion":"Espaol The term sickle cell disease (SCD) describes a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. People with SCD have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin, in their red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Inherited means that the disease is passed by genes from parents to their children. SCD is not contagious. A person cannot catch it, like a cold or infection, from someone else. People who have SCD inherit two abnormal hemoglobin genes, one from each parent. In all forms of SCD, at least one of the two abnormal genes causes a persons body to make hemoglobin S. When a person has two hemoglobin S genes, Hemoglobin SS, the disease is called sickle cell anemia. This is the most common and often most severe kind of SCD. Hemoglobin SC disease and hemoglobin S thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) are two other common forms of SCD. Some Forms of Sickle Cell Disease Hemoglobin SS Hemoglobin SC Hemoglobin S0 thalassemia Hemoglobin S+ thalassemia Hemoglobin SD Hemoglobin SE Overview Cells in tissues need a steady supply of oxygen to work well. Normally, hemoglobin in red blood cells takes up oxygen in the lungs and carries it to all the tissues of the body. Red blood cells that contain normal hemoglobin are disc shaped (like a doughnut without a hole). This shape allows the cells to be flexible so that they can move through large and small blood vessels to deliver oxygen. Sickle hemoglobin is not like normal hemoglobin. It can form stiff rods within the red cell, changing it into a crescent, or sickle shape. Sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and can stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen cant reach nearby tissues. Normal Red Cells and Sickle Red Cells The lack of tissue oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These pain attacks can occur without warning, and a person often needs to go to the hospital for effective treatment. Most children with SCD are pain free between painful crises, but adolescents and adults may also suffer with chronic ongoing pain. The red cell sickling and poor oxygen delivery can also cause organ damage. Over a lifetime, SCD can harm a persons spleen, brain, eyes, lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, penis, joints, bones, or skin. Sickle cells cant change shape easily, so they tend to burst apart or hemolyze. Normal red blood cells live about 90 to 120 days, but sickle cells last only 10 to 20 days. The body is always making new red blood cells to replace the old cells; however, in SCD the body may have trouble keeping up with how fast the cells are being destroyed. Because of this, the number of red blood cells is usually lower than normal. This condition, called anemia, can make a person have less energy. Outlook Sickle cell disease is a life-long illness. The severity of the disease varies widely from person to person. In high-income countries like the United States, the life expectancy of a person with SCD is now about 4060 years. In 1973, the average lifespan of a person with SCD in the United States was only 14 years. Advances in the diagnosis and care of SCD have made this improvement possible. At the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. Unfortunately, most people with SCD are either too old for a transplant or dont have a relative who is a good enough genetic match for them to act as a donor. A well-matched donor is needed to have the best chance for a successful transplant. There are effective treatments that can reduce symptoms and prolong life. Early diagnosis and regular medical care to prevent complications also contribute to improved well-being."},{"prompt":"What causes Sickle Cell Disease ?","completion":"Abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S, causes sickle cell disease (SCD). The problem in hemoglobin S is caused by a small defect in the gene that directs the production of the beta globin part of hemoglobin. This small defect in the beta globin gene causes a problem in the beta globin part of hemoglobin, changing the way that hemoglobin works. (See Overview.) How Is Sickle Cell Disease Inherited? When the hemoglobin S gene is inherited from only one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene is inherited from the other, a person will have sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy. Only rarely do people with sickle cell trait have complications similar to those seen in people with SCD. But people with sickle cell trait are carriers of a defective hemoglobin S gene. So, they can pass it on when they have a child. If the childs other parent also has sickle cell trait or another abnormal hemoglobin gene (like thalassemia, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin D, hemoglobin E), that child has a chance of having SCD. Example of an Inheritance Pattern In the image above, each parent has one hemoglobin A gene and one hemoglobin S gene, and each of their children has: A 25 percent chance of inheriting two normal genes: In this case the child does not have sickle cell trait or disease. (Case 1) A 50 percent chance of inheriting one hemoglobin A gene and one hemoglobin S gene: This child has sickle cell trait. (Cases 2 and 3) A 25 percent chance of inheriting two hemoglobin S genes: This child has sickle cell disease. (Case 4) It is important to keep in mind that each time this couple has a child, the chances of that child having sickle cell disease remain the same. In other words, if the first-born child has sickle cell disease, there is still a 25 percent chance that the second child will also have the disease. Both boys and girls can inherit sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease, or normal hemoglobin. If a person wants to know if he or she carries a sickle hemoglobin gene, a doctor can order a blood test to find out."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Sickle Cell Disease? ?","completion":"In the United States, most people with sickle cell disease (SCD) are of African ancestry or identify themselves as black. About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell trait. About 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell disease. There are also many people with this disease who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds. Approximately 100,000 Americans have SCD."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease ?","completion":"Early Signs and Symptoms If a person has sickle cell disease (SCD), it is present at birth. But most infants do not have any problems from the disease until they are about 5 or 6 months of age. Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories requires that all newborn babies receive screening for SCD. When a child has SCD, parents are notified before the child has symptoms. Some children with SCD will start to have problems early on, and some later. Early symptoms of SCD may include: Painful swelling of the hands and feet, known as dactylitis Fatigue or fussiness from anemia A yellowish color of the skin, known as jaundice, or whites of the eyes, known as icteris, that occurs when a large number of red cells hemolyze The signs and symptoms of SCD will vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. Major Complications of Sickle Cell Disease Acute Pain (Sickle Cell or Vaso-occlusive) Crisis Pain episodes (crises) can occur without warning when sickle cells block blood flow and decrease oxygen delivery. People describe this pain as sharp, intense, stabbing, or throbbing. Severe crises can be even more uncomfortable than post-surgical pain or childbirth. Pain can strike almost anywhere in the body and in more than one spot at a time. But the pain often occurs in the Lower back Legs Arms Abdomen Chest A crisis can be brought on by Illness Temperature changes Stress Dehydration (not drinking enough) Being at high altitudes But often a person does not know what triggers, or causes, the crisis. (See acute pain management.) Chronic Pain Many adolescents and adults with SCD suffer from chronic pain. This kind of pain has been hard for people to describe, but it is usually different from crisis pain or the pain that results from organ damage. Chronic pain can be severe and can make life difficult. Its cause is not well understood. (See chronic pain management.) Severe Anemia People with SCD usually have mild to moderate anemia. At times, however, they can have severe anemia. Severe anemia can be life threatening. Severe anemia in an infant or child with SCD may be caused by: Splenic sequestration crisis. The spleen is an organ that is located in the upper left side of the belly. The spleen filters germs in the blood, breaks up blood cells, and makes a kind of white blood cell. A splenic sequestration crisis occurs when red blood cells get stuck in the spleen, making it enlarge quickly. Since the red blood cells are trapped in the spleen, there are fewer cells to circulate in the blood. This causes severe anemia. A big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child. A big spleen may also cause pain in the left side of the belly. A parent can usuallypalpate or feel the enlarged spleen in the belly of his or her child. Aplastic crisis. This crisis is usually caused by a parvovirus B19 infection, also called fifth disease or slapped cheek syndrome. Parvovirus B19 is a very common infection, but in SCD it can cause the bone marrow to stop producing new red cells for a while, leading to severe anemia. Splenic sequestration crisis and aplastic crisis most commonly occur in infants and children with SCD. Adults with SCD may also experience episodes of severe anemia, but these usually have other causes. No matter the cause, severe anemia may lead to symptoms that include: Shortness of breath Being very tired Feeling dizzy Having pale skin Babies and infants with severe anemia may feed poorly and seem very sluggish. (See anemia management.) Infections The spleen is important for protection against certain kinds of germs. Sickle cells can damage the spleen and weaken or destroy its function early in life. People with SCD who have damaged spleens are at risk for serious bacterial infections that can be life-threatening. Some of these bacteria include: Pneumococcus Hemophilus influenza type B Meningococcus Salmonella Staphylococcus Chlamydia Mycoplasma pneumoniae Bacteria can cause: Blood infection (septicemia) Lung infection (pneumonia) Infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) Bone infection (osteomyelitis) (See how to prevent infections and infection management.) Acute Chest Syndrome Sickling in blood vessels of the lungs can deprive a persons lungs of oxygen. When this happens, areas of lung tissue are damaged and cannot exchange oxygen properly. This condition is known as acute chest syndrome. In acute chest syndrome, at least one segment of the lung is damaged. This condition is very serious and should be treated right away at a hospital. Acute chest syndrome often starts a few days after a painful crisis begins. A lung infection may accompany acute chest syndrome. Symptoms may include: Chest pain Fever Shortness of breath Rapid breathing Cough (See acute chest syndrome management.) Brain Complications Clinical Stroke A stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked to a part of the brain. When this happens, brain cells can be damaged or can die. In SCD, a clinical stroke means that a person shows outward signs that something is wrong. The symptoms depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms of stroke may include: Weakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body Trouble speaking, walking, or understanding Loss of balance Severe headache As many as 24 percent of people with hemoglobin SS and 10 percent of people with hemoglobin SC may suffer a clinical stroke by age 45. In children, clinical stroke occurs most commonly between the ages of 2 and 9, but recent prevention strategies have lowered the risk. (See Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening) and Red Blood Cell Transfusions.) When people with SCD show symptoms of stroke, their families or friends should call 9-1-1 right away. (See clinical stroke management.) Silent Stroke and Thinking Problems Brain imaging and tests of thinking (cognitive studies) have shown that children and adults with hemoglobin SS and hemoglobin S0 thalassemia often have signs of silent brain injury, also called silent stroke. Silent brain injury is damage to the brain without showing outward signs of stroke. This injury is common. Silent brain injury can lead to learning problems or trouble making decisions or holding down a job. (See Cognitive Screening and silent stroke management.) Eye Problems Sickle cell disease can injure blood vessels in the eye. The most common site of damage is the retina, where blood vessels can overgrow, get blocked, or bleed. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain. Detachment of the retina can occur. When the retina detaches, it is lifted or pulled from its normal position. These problems can cause visual impairment or loss. (See Eye Examinations.) Heart Disease People with SCD can have problems with blood vessels in the heart and with heart function. The heart can become enlarged. People can also develop pulmonary hypertension. People with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may also have heart damage from iron overload. (See transfusion management.) Pulmonary Hypertension In adolescents and adults, injury to blood vessels in the lungs can make it hard for the heart to pump blood through them. This causes the pressure in lung blood vessels to rise. High pressure in these blood vessels is called pulmonary hypertension. Symptoms may include shortness of breath and fatigue. When this condition is severe, it has been associated with a higher risk of death. (See screening for pulmonary hypertension.) Kidney Problems The kidneys are sensitive to the effects of red blood cell sickling. SCD causes the kidneys to have trouble making the urine as concentrated as it should be. This may lead to a need to urinate often and to have bedwetting or uncontrolled urination during the night (nocturnal enuresis). This often starts in childhood. Other problems may include: Blood in the urine Decreased kidney function Kidney disease Protein loss in the urine Priapism Males with SCD can have unwanted, sometimes prolonged, painful erections. This condition is called priapism. Priapism happens when blood flow out of the erect penis is blocked by sickled cells. If it goes on for a long period of time, priapism can cause permanent damage to the penis and lead to impotence. If priapism lasts for more than 4 hours, emergency medical care should be sought to avoid complications. (See priapism management.) Gallstones When red cells hemolyze, they release hemoglobin. Hemoglobin gets broken down into a substance called bilirubin. Bilirubin can form stones that get stuck in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, sac-shaped organ beneath the liver that helps with digestion. Gallstones are a common problem in SCD. Gallstones may be formed early on but may not produce symptoms for years. When symptoms develop, they may include: Right-sided upper belly pain Nausea Vomiting If problems continue or recur, a person may need surgery to remove the gallbladder. Liver Complications There are a number of ways in which the liver may be injured in SCD. Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is an uncommon, but severe, form of liver damage that occurs when sickled red cells block blood vessels in the liver. This blockage prevents enough oxygen from reaching liver tissue. These episodes are usually sudden and may recur. Children often recover, but some adults may have chronic problems that lead to liver failure. People with SCD who have received frequent blood transfusions may develop liver damage from iron overload. Leg Ulcers Sickle cell ulcers are sores that usually start small and then get larger and larger. The number of ulcers can vary from one to many. Some ulcers will heal quickly, but others may not heal and may last for long periods of time. Some ulcers come back after healing. People with SCD usually dont get ulcers until after the age of 10. Joint Complications Sickling in the bones of the hip and, less commonly, the shoulder joints, knees, and ankles, can decrease oxygen flow and result in severe damage. This damage is a condition called avascular or aseptic necrosis. This disease is usually found in adolescents and adults. Symptoms include pain and problems with walking and joint movement. A person may need pain medicines, surgery, or joint replacement if symptoms persist. Delayed Growth and Puberty Children with SCD may grow and develop more slowly than their peers because of anemia. They will reach full sexual maturity, but this may be delayed. Pregnancy Pregnancies in women with SCD can be risky for both the mother and the baby. Mothers may have medical complications including: Infections Blood clots High blood pressure Increased pain episodes They are also at higher risk for: Miscarriages Premature births Small-for-dates babies or underweight babies (See pregnancy management.) Mental Health As in other chronic diseases, people with SCD may feel sad and frustrated at times. The limitations that SCD can impose on a persons daily activities may cause them to feel isolated from others. Sometimes they become depressed. People with SCD may also have trouble coping with pain and fatigue, as well as with frequent medical visits and hospitalizations. (See living with emotional issues.)"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Sickle Cell Disease ?","completion":"Screening Tests People who do not know whether they make sickle hemoglobin (hemoglobin S) or another abnormal hemoglobin (such as C, thalassemia, E) can find out by having their blood tested. This way, they can learn whether they carry a gene (i.e., have the trait) for an abnormal hemoglobin that they could pass on to a child. When each parent has this information, he or she can be better informed about the chances of having a child with some type of sickle cell disease (SCD), such as hemoglobin SS, SC, S thalassemia, or others. Newborn Screening When a child has SCD, it is very important to diagnose it early to better prevent complications. Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories require that every baby is tested for SCD as part of a newborn screening program. In newborn screening programs, blood from a heel prick is collected in spots on a special paper. The hemoglobin from this blood is then analyzed in special labs. Newborn screening results are sent to the doctor who ordered the test and to the childs primary doctor. If a baby is found to have SCD, health providers from a special follow-up newborn screening group contact the family directly to make sure that the parents know the results. The child is always retested to be sure that the diagnosis is correct. Newborn screening programs also find out whether the baby has an abnormal hemoglobin trait. If so, parents are informed, and counseling is offered. Remember that when a child has sickle cell trait or SCD, a future sibling, or the childs own future child, may be at risk. These possibilities should be discussed with the primary care doctor, a blood specialist called a hematologist, and/or a genetics counselor. Prenatal Screening Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. This is done using a sample of amniotic fluid, the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo, or tissue taken from the placenta, the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mothers womb. Testing before birth can be done as early as 810 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Sickle Cell Disease ?","completion":"Health Maintenance To Prevent Complications Babies with sickle cell disease (SCD) should be referred to a doctor or provider group that has experience taking care of people with this disease. The doctor might be a hematologist (a doctor with special training in blood diseases) or an experienced general pediatrician, internist, or family practitioner. For infants, the first SCD visit should take place before 8 weeks of age. If someone was born in a country that doesnt perform newborn SCD screening, he or she might be diagnosed with SCD later in childhood. These people should also be referred as soon as possible for special SCD care. Examining the person Giving medicines and immunizations Performing tests Educating families about the disease and what to watch out for Preventing Infection In SCD, the spleen doesnt work properly or doesnt work at all. This problem makes people with SCD more likely to get severe infections. Penicillin In children with SCD, taking penicillin two times a day has been shown to reduce the chance of having a severe infection caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. Infants need to take liquid penicillin. Older children can take tablets. Many doctors will stop prescribing penicillin after a child has reached the age of 5. Some prefer to continue this antibiotic throughout life, particularly if a person has hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia, since people with SCD are still at risk. All people who have had surgical removal of the spleen, called a splenectomy, or a past infection with pneumococcus should keep taking penicillin throughout life. Immunizations People with SCD should receive all recommended childhood vaccines. They should also receive additional vaccines to prevent other infections. Pneumococcus. Even though all children routinely receive the vaccine against pneumococcus (PCV13), children with SCD should also receive a second kind of vaccine against pneumococcus (PPSV23). This second vaccine is given after 24 months of age and again 5 years later. Adults with SCD who have not received any pneumococcal vaccine should get a dose of the PCV13 vaccine. They should later receive the PPSV23 if they have not already received it or it has been more than 5 years since they did. A person should follow these guidelines even if he or she is still taking penicillin. Influenza. All people with SCD should receive an influenza shot every year at the start of flu season. This should begin at 6 months of age. Only the inactivated vaccine, which comes as a shot, should be used in people with SCD. Meningococcus. A child with SCD should receive this vaccine (Menactra or Menveo) at 2, 4, 6, and 1215 months of age. The child should receive a booster vaccine 3 years after this series of shots, then every 5 years after that. Screening Tests and Evaluations Height, Weight, Blood Pressure, and Oxygen Saturation Doctors will monitor height and weight to be sure that a child is growing properly and that a person with SCD is maintaining a healthy weight. Doctors will also track a persons blood pressure. When a person with SCD has high blood pressure, it needs to be treated promptly because it can increase the risk of stroke. Oxygen saturation testing provides information about how much oxygen the blood is carrying. Blood and Urine Testing People with SCD need to have frequent lab tests. Blood tests help to establish a persons baseline for problems like anemia. Blood testing also helps to show whether a person has organ damage, so that it can be treated early. Urine testing can help to detect early kidney problems or infections. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening Children who have hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia and are between the ages of 2 and 16 should have TCD testing once a year. This study can find out whether a child is at higher risk for stroke. When the test is abnormal, regular blood transfusions can decrease the chances of having a stroke. The child is awake during the TCD exam. The test does not hurt at all. The TCD machine uses sound waves to measure blood flow like the ultrasound machine used to examine pregnant women. Eye Examinations An eye doctor, or ophthalmologist, should examine a persons eyes every 12 years from the age of 10 onwards. These exams can detect if there are SCD-related problems of the eye. Regular exams can help doctors find and treat problems early to prevent loss of vision. A person should see his or her doctor right away for any sudden change in vision. Pulmonary Hypertension Doctors have different approaches to screening for pulmonary hypertension. This is because studies have not given clear information as to when and how a person should receive the screening. People with SCD and their caretakers should discuss with their doctor whether screening makes sense for them. Cognitive Screening People with sickle cell disease can develop cognitive (thinking) problems that may be hard to notice early in life. Sometimes these problems are caused by silent strokes that can only be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. People with SCD should tell their doctors or nurses if they have thinking problems, such as difficulties learning in school, slowed decision making, or trouble organizing their thoughts. People can be referred for cognitive testing. This testing can identify areas in which a person could use extra help. Children with SCD who have thinking problems may qualify for an Individualized Education Program, or IEP. An IEP is a plan that helps students to reach their educational goals. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational rehabilitation programs that can help them with job training. Education and Guidance Doctors and other providers will talk with people who have SCD and their caretakers about complications and also review information at every visit. Because there are a lot of things to discuss, new topics are often introduced as a child or adult reaches an age when that subject is important to know about. Doctors and nurses know that there is a lot of information to learn, and they dont expect people to know everything after one discussion. People with SCD and their families should not be afraid to ask questions. Topics that are usually covered include: Hours that medical staff are available and contact information to use when people with SCD or caretakers have questions A plan for what to do and where to get care if a person has a fever, pain, or other signs of SCD complications that need immediate attention How SCD is inherited and the risk of having a child with SCD The importance of regular medical visits, screening tests, and evaluations How to recognize and manage pain How to palpate (feel) a childs spleen. Because of the risk of splenic sequestration crisis, caretakers should learn how to palpate a childs spleen. They should try to feel for the spleen daily and more frequently when the child is ill. If they feel that the spleen is bigger than usual, they should call the care provider. Transitioning Care When children with SCD become adolescents or young adults, they often need to transition from a pediatric care team to an adult care team. This period has been shown to be associated with increased hospital admissions and medical problems. There seem to be many reasons for this. Some of the increased risk is directly related to the disease. As people with SCD get older, they often develop more organ damage and more disabilities. The shift in care usually occurs at the same time that adolescents are undergoing many changes in their emotional, social, and academic lives. The transition to more independent self-management may be difficult, and following treatment plans may become less likely. When compared with pediatrics, there are often fewer adult SCD programs available in a given region. This makes it more difficult for a person with SCD to find appropriate doctors, particularly those with whom they feel comfortable. To improve use of regular medical care by people with SCD and to reduce age-related complications, many SCD teams have developed special programs that the make transition easier. Such programs should involve the pediatric and the adult care teams. They should also start early and continue over several years. Managing Some Complications of SCD Acute Pain Each person with SCD should have a home treatment regimen that is best suited to their needs. The providers on the SCD team usually help a person develop a written, tailored care plan. If possible, the person with SCD should carry this plan with them when they go to the emergency room. When an acute crisis is just starting, most doctors will advise the person to drink lots of fluids and to take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medication, such as ibuprofen. When a person has kidney problems, acetaminophen is often preferred. If pain persists, many people will find that they need a stronger medicine. Combining additional interventions, such as massage, relaxation methods, or a heating pad, may also help. If a person with SCD cannot control the pain at home, he or she should go to an SCD day hospital/outpatient unit or an emergency room to receive additional, stronger medicines and intravenous (IV) fluids. Some people may be able to return home once their pain is under better control. In this case, the doctor may prescribe additional pain medicines for a short course of therapy. People often need to be admitted to the hospital to fully control an acute pain crisis. When taken daily, hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of pain episodes. Chronic Pain Sometimes chronic pain results from a complication, such as a leg ulcer or aseptic necrosis of the hip. In this case, doctors try to treat the complication causing the pain. While chronic pain is common in adults with SCD, the cause is often poorly understood. Taking pain medicines daily may help to decrease the pain. Some examples of these medicines include: NSAID drugs, such as ibuprofen Duloxetine Gabapentin Amitriptyline Strong pain medicines, such as opiates Other approaches, such as massage, heat, or acupuncture may be helpful in some cases. Chronic pain often comes with feelings of depression and anxiety. Supportive counseling and, sometimes, antidepressant medicines may help. (See coping and emotional issues.) Severe Anemia People should see their doctors or go to a hospital right away if they develop anemia symptoms from a splenic sequestration crisis or an aplastic crisis. These conditions can be life-threatening, and the person will need careful monitoring and treatment in the hospital. A person also usually needs a blood transfusion. People with SCD and symptoms of severe anemia from other causes should also see a doctor right away. Infections Fever is a medical emergency in SCD. All caretakers of infants and children with SCD should take their child to their doctor or go to a hospital right away when their child has a fever. Adults with SCD should also seek care for fever or other signs of infection. All children and adults who have SCD and a fever (over 38.50 C or 101.30 F) must be seen by a doctor and treated with antibiotics right away. Some people will need to be hospitalized, while others may receive care and follow-up as an outpatient. Acute Chest Syndrome People with SCD and symptoms of acute chest syndrome should see their doctor or go to a hospital right away. They will need to be admitted to the hospital where they should receive antibiotics and close monitoring. They may need oxygen therapy and a blood transfusion. When taken daily, the medicine hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of acute chest events. Clinical Stroke People with SCD who have symptoms of stroke should be brought to the hospital right away by an ambulance. If a person is having symptoms of stroke, someone should call 9-1-1. Symptoms of stroke may include: Weakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body Trouble speaking, walking, or understanding Loss of balance Severe headache If imaging studies reveal that the person has had an acute stroke, he or she may need an exchange transfusion. This procedure involves slowly removing an amount of the persons blood and replacing it with blood from a donor who does not have SCD or sickle cell trait. Afterward, the person may need to receive monthly transfusions or other treatments to help to prevent another stroke. Silent Stroke and Cognitive Problems Children and adults with SCD and cognitive problems may be able to get useful help based upon the results of their testing. For instance, children may qualify for an IEP. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational, or job, training programs. Priapism Sometimes, a person may be able to relieve priapism by: Emptying the bladder by urinating Taking medicine Increasing fluid intake Doing light exercise If a person has an episode that lasts for 4 hours or more, he should go to the hospital to see a hematologist and urologist. Pregnancy Pregnant women with SCD are at greater risk for problems. They should always see an obstetrician, or OB, who has experience with SCD and high-risk pregnancies and deliveries. The obstetrician should work with a hematologist or primary medical doctor who is well informed about SCD and its complications. Pregnant women with SCD need more frequent medical visits so that their doctors can follow them closely. The doctor may prescribe certain vitamins and will be careful to prescribe pain medicines that are safe for the baby. A pregnant woman with SCD may need to have one or more blood transfusions during her pregnancy to treat complications, such as worsening anemia or an increased number of pain or acute chest syndrome events. Hydroxyurea What Is Hydroxyurea? Hydroxyurea is an oral medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications. This medicine was studied in patients with SCD because it was known to increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in the blood. Increased hemoglobin F provides some protection against the effects of hemoglobin S. Hydroxyurea was later found to have several other benefits for a person with SCD, such as decreasing inflammation. Use in adults. Many studies of adults with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. It also improved anemia and decreased the need for transfusions and hospital admissions. Use in children. Studies in children with severe hemoglobin SS or S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. A study of very young children (between the ages of 9 and 18 months) with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia also showed that hydroxyurea decreased the number of episodes of pain and dactylitis. Who Should Use Hydroxyurea? Since hydroxyurea can decrease several complications of SCD, most experts recommend that children and adults with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia who have frequent painful episodes, recurrent chest crises, or severe anemia take hydroxyurea daily. Some experts offer hydroxyurea to all infants over 9 months of age and young children with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia, even if they do not have severe clinical problems, to prevent or reduce the chance of complications. There is no information about how safe or effective hydroxyurea is in children under 9 months of age. Some experts will prescribe hydroxyurea to people with other types of SCD who have severe, recurrent pain. There is little information available about how effective hydroxyurea is for these types of SCD. In all situations, people with SCD should discuss with their doctors whether or not hydroxyurea is an appropriate medication for them. Pregnant women should not use hydroxyurea. How Is Hydroxyurea Taken? To work properly, hydroxyurea should be taken by mouth daily at the prescribed dose. When a person does not take it regularly, it will not work as well, or it wont work at all. A person with SCD who is taking hydroxyurea needs careful monitoring. This is particularly true in the early weeks of taking the medicine. Monitoring includes regular blood testing and dose adjustments. What Are the Risks of Hydroxyurea? Hydroxyurea can cause the bloods white cell count or platelet count to drop. In rare cases, it can worsen anemia. These side effects usually go away quickly if a person stops taking the medication. When a person restarts it, a doctor usually prescribes a lower dose. Other short-term side effects are less common. It is still unclear whether hydroxyurea can cause problems later in life in people with SCD who take it for many years. Studies so far suggest that it does not put people at a higher risk of cancer and does not affect growth in children. But further studies are needed. Red Blood Cell Transfusions Doctors may use acute and chronic red blood cell transfusions to treat and prevent certain SCD complications. The red blood cells in a transfusion have normal hemoglobin in them. A transfusion helps to raise the number of red blood cells and provides normal red blood cells that are more flexible than red blood cells with sickle hemoglobin. These cells live longer in the circulation. Red blood cell transfusions decrease vaso-occlusion (blockage in the blood vessel) and improve oxygen delivery to the tissues and organs. Acute Transfusion in SCD Doctors use blood transfusions in SCD for complications that cause severe anemia. They may also use them when a person has an acute stroke, in many cases of acute chest crises, and in multi-organ failure. A person with SCD usually receives blood transfusions before surgery to prevent SCD-related complications afterwards. Chronic Transfusion Doctors recommend regular or ongoing blood transfusions for people who have had an acute stroke, since transfusions decrease the chances of having another stroke. Doctors also recommend chronic blood transfusions for children who have abnormal TCD ultrasound results because transfusions can reduce the chance of having a first stroke. Some doctors use this approach to treat complications that do not improve with hydroxyurea. They may also use transfusions in people who have too many side effects from hydroxyurea. What Are the Risks of Transfusion Therapy? Possible complications include: Hemolysis Iron overload, particularly in people receiving chronic transfusions (can severely impair heart and lung function) Infection Alloimmunization (can make it hard to find a matching unit of blood for a future transfusion) All blood banks and hospital personnel have adopted practices to reduce the risk of transfusion problems. People with SCD who receive transfusions should be monitored for and immunized against hepatitis. They should also receive regular screenings for iron overload. If a person has iron overload, the doctor will give chelation therapy, a medicine to reduce the amount of iron in the body and the problems that iron overload causes. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation At the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. People with SCD and their families should ask their doctor about this procedure. What Are Stem Cells? Stem cells are special cells that can divide over and over again. After they divide, these cells can go on to become blood red cells, white cells, or platelets. A person with SCD has stem cells that make red blood cells that can sickle. People without SCD have stem cells that make red cells that usually wont sickle. What Stem Cells Are Used in HSCT? In HSCT, stem cells are taken from the bone marrow or blood of a person who does not have sickle cell disease (the donor). The donor, however, may have sickle cell trait. The donor is often the persons sister or brother. This is because the safest and most successful transplants use stem cells that are matched for special proteins called HLA antigens. Since these antigens are inherited from parents, a sister or brother is the most likely person to have the same antigens as the person with SCD. What Happens During HSCT? First, stem cells are taken from the donor. After this, the person with SCD (the recipient) is treated with drugs that destroy or reduce his or her own bone marrow stem cells. The donor stem cells are then injected into the persons vein. The injected cells will make a home in the recipients bone marrow, gradually replacing the recipients cells. The new stem cells will make red cells that do not sickle. Which People Receive HSCT? At the present time, most SCD transplants are performed in children who have had complications such as strokes, acute chest crises, and recurring pain crises. These transplants usually use a matched donor. Because only about 1 in 10 children with SCD has a matched donor without SCD in their families, the number of people with SCD who get transplants is low. HSCT is more risky in adults, and that is why most transplants are done in children. There are several medical centers that are researching new SCD HSCT techniques in children and adults who dont have a matched donor in the family or are older than most recipients. Hopefully, more people with SCD will be able to receive a transplant in the future, using these new methods. What Are the Risks? HSCT is successful in about 85 percent of children when the donor is related and HLA matched. Even with this high success rate, HSCT still has risks. Complications can include severe infections, seizures, and other clinical problems. About 5 percent of people have died. Sometimes transplanted cells attack the recipients organs (graft versus host disease). Medicines are given to prevent many of the complications, but they still can happen."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Sickle Cell Disease ?","completion":"People who do not know whether they carry an abnormal hemoglobin gene can ask their doctor to have their blood tested. Couples who are planning to have children and know that they are at risk of having a child with sickle cell disease (SCD) may want to meet with a genetics counselor. A genetics counselor can answer questions about the risk and explain the choices that are available."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Polycythemia Vera ?","completion":"Polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THEE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah), or PV, is a rare blood disease in which your body makes too many red blood cells. The extra red blood cells make your blood thicker than normal. As a result, blood clots can form more easily. These clots can block blood flow through your arteries and veins, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. Thicker blood also doesn't flow as quickly to your body as normal blood. Slowed blood flow prevents your organs from getting enough oxygen, which can cause serious problems, such as angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) and heart failure. (Angina is chest pain or discomfort.) Overview Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body's cells and carry it to the lungs to be exhaled. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in your bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. If you have PV, your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It also can make too many white blood cells and platelets. A mutation, or change, in the body's JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV. This gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells. What causes the change in the JAK2 gene isn't known. PV generally isn't inheritedthat is, passed from parents to children through genes. PV develops slowly and may not cause symptoms for years. The disease often is found during routine blood tests done for other reasons. When signs and symptoms are present, they're the result of the thick blood that occurs with PV. This thickness slows the flow of oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. Without enough oxygen, many parts of your body won't work normally. For example, slower blood flow deprives your arms, legs, lungs, and eyes of the oxygen they need. This can cause headaches, dizziness, itching, and vision problems, such as blurred or double vision. Outlook PV is a serious, chronic (ongoing) disease that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. PV has no cure, but treatments can help control the disease and its complications. PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease."},{"prompt":"What causes Polycythemia Vera ?","completion":"Primary Polycythemia Polycythemia vera (PV) also is known as primary polycythemia. A mutation, or change, in the body's JAK2 gene is the main cause of PV. The JAK2 gene makes a protein that helps the body produce blood cells. What causes the change in the JAK2 gene isn't known. PV generally isn't inheritedthat is, passed from parents to children through genes. However, in some families, the JAK2 gene may have a tendency to mutate. Other, unknown genetic factors also may play a role in causing PV. Secondary Polycythemia Another type of polycythemia, called secondary polycythemia, isn't related to the JAK2 gene. Long-term exposure to low oxygen levels causes secondary polycythemia. A lack of oxygen over a long period can cause your body to make more of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). High levels of EPO can prompt your body to make more red blood cells than normal. This leads to thicker blood, as seen in PV. People who have severe heart or lung disease may develop secondary polycythemia. People who smoke, spend long hours at high altitudes, or are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide where they work or live also are at risk. For example, working in an underground parking garage or living in a home with a poorly vented fireplace or furnace can raise your risk for secondary polycythemia. Rarely, tumors can make and release EPO, or certain blood problems can cause the body to make more EPO. Sometimes doctors can cure secondary polycythemiait depends on whether the underlying cause can be stopped, controlled, or cured."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Polycythemia Vera? ?","completion":"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a rare blood disease.

Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. They also can cause your liver and spleen to enlarge. Blood clots in the liver and spleen can cause sudden, intense pain. Slowed blood flow also prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching your organs. This can lead to angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart failure. The high levels of red blood cells that PV causes can lead to stomach ulcers, gout, or kidney stones. Some people who have PV may develop myelofibrosis (MY-e-lo-fi-BRO-sis). This is a condition in which your bone marrow is replaced with scar tissue. Abnormal bone marrow cells may begin to grow out of control. This abnormal growth can lead to acute myelogenous (my-eh-LOJ-eh-nus) leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This disease can worsen very quickly."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Polycythemia Vera ?","completion":"Polycythemia vera (PV) may not cause signs or symptoms for years. The disease often is found during routine blood tests done for other reasons. If the results of your blood tests aren't normal, your doctor may want to do more tests. Your doctor will diagnose PV based on your signs and symptoms, your age and overall health, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of PV. He or she will check for an enlarged spleen, red skin on your face, and bleeding from your gums. If your doctor confirms that you have polycythemia, the next step is to find out whether you have primary polycythemia (polycythemia vera) or secondary polycythemia. Your medical history and physical exam may confirm which type of polycythemia you have. If not, you may have tests that check the level of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in your blood. People who have PV have very low levels of EPO. People who have secondary polycythemia usually have normal or high levels of EPO. Specialists Involved If your primary care doctor thinks you have PV, he or she may refer you to a hematologist. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and conditions. Diagnostic Tests You may have blood tests to diagnose PV. These tests include a complete blood count (CBC) and other tests, if necessary. Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose PV is a CBC. The CBC measures many parts of your blood. This test checks your hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A high level of hemoglobin or hematocrit may be a sign of PV. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of PV, a blood disorder, an infection, or another condition. In addition to high red blood cell counts, people who have PV also may have high white blood cell and/or platelet counts. Other Blood Tests Blood smear. For this test, a small sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood sample is examined under a microscope. A blood smear can show whether you have a higher than normal number of red blood cells. The test also can show abnormal blood cells that are linked to myelofibrosis and other conditions related to PV. Erythropoietin level. This blood test measures the level of EPO in your blood. EPO is a hormone that prompts your bone marrow to make new blood cells. People who have PV have very low levels of EPO. People who have secondary polycythemia usually have normal or high levels of EPO. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is healthy. These tests also show whether your bone marrow is making normal amounts of blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy. For aspiration, your doctor removes a small amount of fluid bone marrow through a needle. For a biopsy, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a larger needle. The samples are then examined under a microscope. If the tests show that your bone marrow is making too many blood cells, it may be a sign that you have PV."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Polycythemia Vera ?","completion":"Polycythemia vera (PV) doesn't have a cure. However, treatments can help control the disease and its complications. PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease. Goals of Treatment The goals of treating PV are to control symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, especially heart attack and stroke. To do this, PV treatments reduce the number of red blood cells and the level of hemoglobin (an iron-rich protein) in the blood. This brings the thickness of your blood closer to normal. Blood with normal thickness flows better through the blood vessels. This reduces the chance that blood clots will form and cause a heart attack or stroke. Blood with normal thickness also ensures that your body gets enough oxygen. This can help reduce some of the signs and symptoms of PV, such as headaches, vision problems, and itching. Studies show that treating PV greatly improves your chances of living longer. The goal of treating secondary polycythemia is to control its underlying cause, if possible. For example, if the cause is carbon monoxide exposure, the goal is to find the source of the carbon monoxide and fix or remove it. Treatments To Lower Red Blood Cell Levels Phlebotomy Phlebotomy (fle-BOT-o-me) is a procedure that removes some blood from your body. For this procedure, a needle is inserted into one of your veins. Blood from the vein flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag. The process is similar to the process of donating blood. Phlebotomy reduces your red blood cell count and starts to bring your blood thickness closer to normal. Typically, a pint (1 unit) of blood is removed each week until your hematocrit level approaches normal. (Hematocrit is the measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.) You may need to have phlebotomy done every few months. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to keep your bone marrow from making too many red blood cells. Examples of these medicines include hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha. Hydroxyurea is a medicine generally used to treat cancer. This medicine can reduce the number of red blood cells and platelets in your blood. As a result, this medicine helps improve your blood flow and bring the thickness of your blood closer to normal. Interferon-alpha is a substance that your body normally makes. It also can be used to treat PV. Interferon-alpha can prompt your immune system to fight overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal. Radiation Treatment Radiation treatment can help suppress overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal. However, radiation treatment can raise your risk of leukemia (blood cancer) and other blood diseases. Treatments for Symptoms Aspirin can relieve bone pain and burning feelings in your hands or feet that you may have as a result of PV. Aspirin also thins your blood, so it reduces the risk of blood clots. Aspirin can have side effects, including bleeding in the stomach and intestines. For this reason, take aspirin only as your doctor recommends. If your PV causes itching, your doctor may prescribe medicines to ease the discomfort. Your doctor also may prescribe ultraviolet light treatment to help relieve your itching. Other ways to reduce itching include: Avoiding hot baths. Cooler water can limit irritation to your skin. Gently patting yourself dry after bathing. Vigorous rubbing with a towel can irritate your skin. Taking starch baths. Add half a box of starch to a tub of lukewarm water. This can help soothe your skin. Experimental Treatments Researchers are studying other treatments for PV. An experimental treatment for itching involves taking low doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This type of medicine is used to treat depression. In clinical trials, SSRIs reduced itching in people who had PV. Imatinib mesylate is a medicine that's approved for treating leukemia. In clinical trials, this medicine helped reduce the need for phlebotomy in people who had PV. This medicine also helped reduce the size of enlarged spleens. Researchers also are trying to find a treatment that can block or limit the effects of an abnormal JAK2 gene. (A mutation, or change, in the JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV.)"},{"prompt":"w to prevent Polycythemia Vera ?","completion":"Primary polycythemia (polycythemia vera) can't be prevented. However, with proper treatment, you can prevent or delay symptoms and complications. Sometimes you can prevent secondary polycythemia by avoiding things that deprive your body of oxygen for long periods. For example, you can avoid mountain climbing, living at a high altitude, or smoking. People who have serious heart or lung diseases may develop secondary polycythemia. Treatment for the underlying disease may improve the secondary polycythemia. Following a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of heart and lung diseases also will help you prevent secondary polycythemia."},{"prompt":"What is (are) High Blood Cholesterol ?","completion":"To understand high blood cholesterol (ko-LES-ter-ol), it helps to learn about cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance thats found in all cells of the body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. However, cholesterol also is found in some of the foods you eat. Cholesterol travels through your bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (lip-o-PRO-teens). These packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside. Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout your body: low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important. LDL cholesterol sometimes is called bad cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. (Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.) HDL cholesterol sometimes is called good cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. What Is High Blood Cholesterol? High blood cholesterol is a condition in which you have too much cholesterol in your blood. By itself, the condition usually has no signs or symptoms. Thus, many people dont know that their cholesterol levels are too high. People who have high blood cholesterol have a greater chance of getting coronary heart disease, also called coronary artery disease. (In this article, the term heart disease refers to coronary heart disease.) The higher the level of LDL cholesterol in your blood, the GREATER your chance is of getting heart disease. The higher the level of HDL cholesterol in your blood, the LOWER your chance is of getting heart disease. Coronary heart disease is a condition in which plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis). Atherosclerosis Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This causes a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) or a heart attack may occur. Angina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also may occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. A heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious problems or death. Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, such as the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Outlook Lowering your cholesterol may slow, reduce, or even stop the buildup of plaque in your arteries. It also may reduce the risk of plaque rupturing and causing dangerous blood clots.

You can control some factors, but not others. Factors You Can Control Diet Cholesterol is found in foods that come from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese. Some foods have fats that raise your cholesterol level. For example, saturated fat raises your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level more than anything else in your diet. Saturated fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Trans fatty acids (trans fats) raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats are made when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to harden it. Trans fats are found in some fried and processed foods. Limiting foods with cholesterol, saturated fat, and trans fats can help you control your cholesterol levels. Physical Activity and Weight Lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level. (Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including LDL and HDL.) Routine physical activity can help you lose weight and lower your LDL cholesterol. Being physically active also can help you raise your HDL cholesterol level. Factors You Cant Control Heredity High blood cholesterol can run in families. An inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia causes very high LDL cholesterol. (Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) This condition begins at birth, and it may cause a heart attack at an early age. Age and Sex Starting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol than women. As women and men age, their LDL cholesterol levels often rise. Before age 55, women usually have lower LDL cholesterol levels than men. However, afterage 55, women can have higher LDL levels than men."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of High Blood Cholesterol ?","completion":"High blood cholesterol usually has no signs or symptoms.
