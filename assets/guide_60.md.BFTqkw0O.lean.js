To prove K, Y, L are collinear, it suffices to show Y is sent to X in this homothety: [ frac{GO}{OZ} = frac{GY}{YX} ] - Since G and X are inverses with respect to omega, and O is the midpoint of YZ, we have: [ OG cdot OX = OY^2 implies (X, Y; G, Z) = -1 implies frac{GO}{OZ} = frac{GY}{YX} ] - Therefore, K, Y, L are collinear, and since KL perp OG by Brokard's Theorem, KL must be tangent to omega at Y. 4. **Midpoints and Perpendicular Bisector:** - The line passing through the midpoints of KE and LF is the perpendicular bisector of XY. - Let A' be the center of the circle (AXY). 5. **Claim 2: A', A_1, O are collinear.** - It suffices to prove that A_1 is on the perpendicular bisector of AY. - Observe: [ frac{GO}{OA} = frac{GO}{OZ} = frac{GA_1}{A_1A} ] - This implies OA_1 is the angle bisector of angle GOA, so O, A_1 are on the perpendicular bisector of AY. Thus, A', A_1, O are collinear. 6. **Claim 3: The points O, X, A', A are concyclic.** - X and Y must be distinct points, otherwise GY = GX implies A_1B_1C_1D_1 is the same as ABCD. - Since O lies strictly inside ABCD and cannot be concyclic with ABCD, OX neq OA. - Since OA' is the angle bisector of angle AOX, the points O, X, A', A are concyclic. 7. **Conclusion:** - Claims 2 and 3 imply that A' and A_1 are inverses with respect to omega, where A' lies on the perpendicular bisector of XY. - Similarly, the inverses of B_1, C_1, D_1 with respect to omega will be on the perpendicular bisector of XY.

The projection of the cross-section on the plane (ABC) is the trapezoid (CMN_1 K_1), and its area is calculated as follows: [ S_{np} = S_{BMC} - S_{BN_1 K_1} = S_{ABC} left( frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} S_{ABC} ] Substitute (S_{ABC}): [ S_{ABC} = a^2 frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] Thus: [ S_{np} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{8} = 7 sqrt{3} ] 3. **Find the cosine of the angle (alpha) of inclination of the cross-section plane to the base plane:** Using the formula (S_{c e y} = frac{S_{np}}{cos alpha}), we get: [ cos alpha = frac{S_{np}}{S_{c e y}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] 4. **Find the height (h) of the prism:** Construct a plane (BHL) passing through point (B) and perpendicular to the line (MC) at the intersection of the base and cross-section planes ((BH perp MC, LH perp MC)). The angle (alpha) formed by the intersection line is: [ cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}, quad sin alpha = frac{sqrt{3 - cos^2 alpha}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2 sqrt{6}}{3} ] Hence: [ tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = sqrt{2} ] Thus, we have: [ 2h = BL = BH cdot tan alpha = 4sqrt{3}, quad h = 2sqrt{3} ] 5. **Find the volumes of divided sections:** The volume (V_{L B M C}) can be calculated as: [ V_{LBMC} = frac{1}{3} cdot S_{BMC} cdot BL = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{2}{3} S_{ABC} cdot BL = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{18} cdot BL = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{18} cdot 4sqrt{6} = frac{112}{3} ] Then: [ V_{LB_{1}, NK} = frac{1}{8} V_{LBMC}, quad V_{BMC R_{NK}} = frac{7}{8} V_{LBMC} = frac{98}{3}, quad V_{ABC A_1 B_1 C_1} = S_{ABC} cdot BB_1 = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{4} cdot h = 84 ] Finally: [ V_{AMCANK C_1} = 84 - frac{98}{3} = frac{154}{3} ] [ text{Volumes: } frac{112}{3}, frac{154}{3} ] (boxed{frac{112}{3}, frac{154}{3}})"},{"prompt":"The values of ( x ) that satisfy ( frac{1}{x1} > 1 ) are given by: (a) ( x < 2 ); (b) ( x > 1 ); (c) ( 1 < x < 2 ); (d) ( x < 1 ); (e) ( x > 2 ).","completion":": 1. Let's start by manipulating the given inequality: [ frac{1}{x - 1} > 1 ] 2. Notice that multiplying both sides by (x - 1) without any constraints on (x - 1) is tricky, as it can change the direction of the inequality depending on the sign of (x - 1). Therefore, we need to carefully consider the domain where (x - 1) is positive and negative separately. 3. First, consider (x - 1 > 0 implies x > 1): - For (x > 1), multiplying both sides of the inequality by (x - 1), which is positive, keeps the inequality direction the same: [ frac{1}{x - 1} > 1 implies 1 > (x - 1) quad text{(since } frac{1}{x - 1} cdot (x - 1) = 1 text{)} ] - Therefore, we get: [ 1 > x - 1 implies 1 + 1 > x implies 2 > x implies x < 2 ] 4.

Select two arbitrary points B and C on omega, and let the point D be the intersection of the angle bisector of angle ABC with the circle omega. 2. **Intermediate Point Definition:** Let K be such a point that D is the midpoint of segment AK. We need to show that a certain point P, where KC intersects omega again (other than C), does not depend on the choice of points B and C. 3. **Find Relationship between Angles and Arcs:** To show that P is the same regardless of B and C, we show that P is diametrically opposite to A, meaning P is the same for any angle angle ABC. Since D is on the angle bisector of angle ABC, overarc{AD} = overarc{DC}, implying AD = DC. 4. **Properties of the Midpoint:** Since D is the midpoint of AK, it follows that AD = DK. Therefore: [ AD = DC = DK ] This implies that in the triangle ACK, D is the midpoint of both AK and CK. 5. **Show Perpendicularity:** Since D is the midpoint, segment CD acts as a median and also an altitude in triangle ACK. Hence, triangle AKC is right-angled at C: [ angle ACK = 90^circ ] 6. **Conclude the Position of P:** Hence, PA must be perpendicular to AK, and as K neq C, point P must be the point on omega such that AK=2AD , and AK intersects omega again only at point P. Therefore, P must lie on the opposite side of A forming a diameter. **Conclusion:** Thus, point P, defined as the secondary intersection of KC with omega, indeed lies diametrically opposite to A.

For a quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0, it has two distinct roots if and only if the discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4ac > 0.

Similarly, the radical axis of circles k and c is the line K_1R_3. Hence, the power of M_1 in relation to circles p and k is equal because M_1 lies on the radical axis of both these circle pairs. 7.

Comparing this with the given equation a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}=ab, we can rewrite the equation as: [ 2abcos C = ab ] 2. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ cos C = frac{ab}{2ab} = frac{1}{2} ] 3.

Therefore, the measure of angle C is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}. # Part 2: Determining the Shape of triangle ABC Given vectors overrightarrow a=left(2sin A,1right) and overrightarrow b=({cos C,frac{1}{2}}) are collinear, we aim to determine the shape of triangle ABC. 1. For vectors overrightarrow a and overrightarrow b to be collinear, their cross product must be zero, or equivalently, their ratios must be equal.

For n geq 2, consider a_n = S_n - S_{n-1}. Using the given recurrence relation a_{n+1} = 2sqrt{S_n}, we obtain: [ a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 2sqrt{S_n} - 1 ] To use this, we express sqrt{S_n} in a way that takes advantage of the sequence. Notice: [ left( sqrt{S_n} - 1 right)^2 = S_{n-1} Rightarrow sqrt{S_n} = sqrt{S_{n-1}} + 1 ] This indicates that {sqrt{S_n}} is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. 4.

What is the speed of the current?","completion":"To find the speed of the current, we first need to determine the speed of the boat when it is going downstream. The man can row the boat at 26 kmph in still water, which is equivalent to: 26 kmph = 26 * 1000 meters per hour = 26000 meters per hour To convert this speed to meters per second, we divide by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour): 26000 meters per hour / 3600 seconds per hour = 7.22222222 meters per second Now, we know that the man takes 17.998560115190784 seconds to cover 150 meters downstream. To find the downstream speed, we divide the distance by the time taken: Downstream speed = Distance / Time Downstream speed = 150 meters / 17.998560115190784 seconds ≈ 8.334 meters per second The downstream speed is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current. Therefore, to find the speed of the current, we subtract the speed of the boat in still water from the downstream speed: Speed of the current = Downstream speed - Speed of the boat in still water Speed of the current = 8.334 meters per second - 7.22222222 meters per second ≈ 1.11177778 meters per second To convert this speed back to kilometers per hour, we multiply by 3600 and then divide by 1000: Speed of the current = 1.11177778 meters per second * 3600 seconds per hour / 1000 meters per kilometer ≈ 4.0024 kmph Therefore, the speed of the current is approximately boxed{4.0024} kmph."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an odd number?","completion":"- Odd numbers have a units digit of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. - The smallest digit that does not appear in the list of possible units digits for odd numbers is 0, which is even. - Therefore, the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an odd number is boxed{0}."},{"prompt":"evaluate : [(10010 12 * (3 + 7)) / 5] * (2 ^ 3) = ?","completion":"Let's solve the expression step by step: 1.

This is the time it takes for the combined lengths of the trains to pass a single point. First, we convert the speeds from km/h to m/s because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. Speed of first train in m/s = 120 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 120 * 1000 / 3600 = 33.33 m/s Speed of second train in m/s = 105 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 105 * 1000 / 3600 = 29.17 m/s Now, we add the lengths of the two trains to find the total distance that needs to be covered for them to be clear of each other. Total length = Length of first train + Length of second train Total length = 431 meters + 365 meters = 796 meters The relative speed at which the two trains are moving towards each other is the sum of their individual speeds since they are moving in opposite directions. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 33.33 m/s + 29.17 m/s = 62.5 m/s Now, we can find the time it takes for the trains to pass each other by dividing the total length by the relative speed.

Begin by considering four rotations centered at (A), (B), (C), and (D) with angles of (90^circ). Refer to Figure 32 mentioned in the problem statement for visual guidance. 2. The sum of the first two rotations represents a symmetry relative to point (O_1): [ R_A(90^circ) circ R_B(90^circ) = S_{O_1} ] where (S_{O_1}) denotes a symmetry about point (O_1). 3. Similarly, the sum of the last two rotations represents a symmetry with respect to point (O_3). As (O_3) coincides with (O_1), we have: [ R_C(90^circ) circ R_D(90^circ) = S_{O_3} = S_{O_1} ] 4. Therefore, the combined effect of all four (90^circ) rotations is an identical transformation: [ R_A(90^circ) circ R_B(90^circ) circ R_C(90^circ) circ R_D(90^circ) = text{id} ] This is because the sum of two symmetries with a common center results in an identity transformation. 5. Consider the sum of these four rotations taken in a new order: first the second rotation, then the third, then the fourth, and finally the first. This new order still results in an identical transformation: [ R_B(90^circ) circ R_C(90^circ) circ R_D(90^circ) circ R_A(90^circ) = text{id} ] 6. For any arbitrary point (M) in the plane, these new ordered rotations will map (M) to some point (M'), continue to map (M') to some (M''), (M'') to (M'''), and finally map (M''' ) back to (M'). Thus, this sequence confirms the identity transformation, reinforcing that the total transformation sums to an identity. 7. The sum of the second and third rotations represents a symmetry centered at vertex (O_2) of the isosceles right triangle (triangle BCO_2): [ R_B(90^circ) circ R_C(90^circ) = S_{O_2} ] 8. The sum of the fourth and first rotations as taken in the original problem is also a symmetry, centered at vertex (O) of the isosceles right triangle (triangle DAO): [ R_D(90^circ) circ R_A(90^circ) = S_{O} ] 9.

The HCF (Highest Common Factor) is given as 20, and the other three factors of their LCM are 3^2 (which is 9), 17, and 23. Since the HCF is a factor of both numbers, it will be included in the LCM. The LCM is obtained by multiplying the HCF with the other distinct prime factors of the two numbers. So, the LCM of the two numbers is: LCM = HCF × (3^2) × 17 × 23 LCM = 20 × 9 × 17 × 23 LCM = 20 × 153 × 23 LCM = 20 × 3519 LCM = 70380 Now, we know that the LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number. Since the HCF is 20, we know that both numbers have 2^2 and 5 as factors (because 20 = 2^2 × 5). Let's denote the two numbers as A and B, with A being the larger number. We know that A must be a multiple of the HCF, and it must include the HCF's prime factors at least to the power they appear in the HCF. Additionally, A could include any combination of the other prime factors (3^2, 17, and 23) that appear in the LCM. Since we are looking for the larger number, we will assume that A includes the highest powers of the remaining prime factors from the LCM. Therefore, A would be: A = HCF × (3^2) × 17 × 23 A = 20 × 9 × 17 × 23 A = 20 × 153 × 23 A = 20 × 3519 A = 70380 However, this would mean that A is equal to the LCM, which is only possible if the other number B is equal to the HCF (since LCM × HCF = Product of the two numbers). This is a valid scenario, but if we are looking for two distinct numbers larger than the HCF, we need to distribute the prime factors differently. Let's assume that the larger number A includes the 3^2, 17, and 23 factors, while the smaller number B only includes the factor of 20 (the HCF). In this case, A would still be 70380, and B would be 20.

The new coloring will still be proper because: - No two vertices colored 1 (original or recolored) share an edge. - The graph maintains (k) colors as assumed initially. 3. **Continuation with Another Color:** With this logic, some vertices colored 2 were not recolored. Hence, these must be adjacent to vertices colored 1. We can continue this recoloring process for vertices of color 3, 4, ..., up to the last color (k) recursively: - For color 3, recolor vertices that do not share an edge with vertices colored 2 to color 2. - Continue this process until reaching the last color (k). 4. **Analyzing the Last Color (k):** Consider any vertex that remains colored (k): - This vertex is adjacent to at least one vertex colored (k-1. Considering a vertex initially colored (k-1), since it was not recolored, it is adjacent to a vertex colored (k-2). - Following this reasoning, there is always a chain of adjacent vertices that connects vertices of the highest color (k) down to vertices colored 1. 5. **Existence of the Path:** By recursively examining the adjacency: - Starting with any vertex initially colored (k), following successive adjacency leads us to vertices of colors (k-1), (k-2), and so on, down to 1. - There exists a sequence or path where each color 1 through (k) appears exactly once. Construct such a path by starting with any (k)-colored vertex and proceed backwards in the adjacency chain through the other colors. # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that in such a properly colored graph, there indeed exists a path where vertices appear with all (k) colors exactly once.

Given ( q = 2 ) and the fact that both ( a ) and ( p ) are odd primes, this contradictory scenario cannot occur since a valid pair ((a, p)) that sums to 2 doesn't exist. 4. Based on the analysis from both scenarios, it is clear that the only consistent possibility is the one where ( a ) must be 2. This is because if any other value for ( a ) would lead to contradictions regarding the nature of primes and their sums. # Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the value of y if |y3| = |y5|?

This means that (M) is located at the average of the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle. 2. **Express the angles in terms of the triangle's sides and medians:** Let (G) be the centroid of (triangle ABC).

To find the minimum value of a that satisfies this condition, we need to consider the maximum value of x^{2} in the given interval. Since x ranges from 1 to 2, x^{2} will have its maximum value at the upper endpoint of this interval because the square function f(x)=x^{2} is increasing in the interval [1,2]. 3.

We draw a directed edge from participant A to participant B (denoted A rightarrow B) if A is considered better than B by at least 51 judges. In simpler terms, A rightarrow B represents that a majority of the judges think A is better than B. 2. **Properties of the Graph:** Let's examine some inherent properties of this graph. Each directed edge A rightarrow B signifies that A is better than B by a majority vote. Importantly, we need to investigate if such a graph has no cycle. 3. **Transitivity:** If the directed graph contains edges A rightarrow B and B rightarrow C, then it must also contain the edge A rightarrow C. This is because: - Suppose for contradiction that C is better than A by at least 50 judges. Since C is better than A by exactly half the judges and we also have B better than C by a considerable number of judges, it would contradict the given condition that no such three judges exist. 4. **Base Case for Induction:** For the base case, consider the simplest non-trivial scenario, n = 2. For two participants, a majority of judges will determine who is better, creating a direct edge in one direction if one exists. This is trivially orderable. 5. **Inductive Step:** We assume that for a directed graph with n vertices adhering to our derived conditions, we can number the vertices such that every arrow goes from a lower number to a higher number. Now, we extend the proof to n + 1 vertices. 6. **Finding a Suitable Vertex:** Consider the graph with n + 1 vertices. If there was no vertex from which no outgoing edge existed, every vertex has at least one outgoing arrow. Choosing any vertex and moving along the arrows, we must eventually revisit a previously encountered vertex, creating an oriented cycle. However, based on our initial assumption, such a cycle is impossible. Therefore, a vertex A exists with no outgoing directed edge. 7. **Reducing the Problem:** Label this vertex A with number n+1 and remove it from the graph. By induction assumption, the remaining n vertices can indeed be ordered such that all arrows point from a lower numbered vertex to a higher numbered vertex. 8. **Relabel and Reexamine:** Relabel the vertices of the remaining graph from 1 to n. Since A had no outgoing edges, reintroducing A and giving it the label n+1 ensures that all conditions are still maintained, as A sits naturally at the highest ranking with no contradictions. Thus, the entire graph can be ordered without any violations. # Conclusion: By using an inductive argument and transitivity properties, we've shown that the participants can be ranked in such a manner that, for any two participants A and B, the one higher in the ranking is considered better by a majority of judges.

Now let’s consider the following two cases: Case 1: Suppose k^3 is blue. 1. By the Lemma, k^6 = (k^3)^2 is red. 2. Since k^2 cdot k^4 = k^6, and both k^2 and k^6 are red, it follows that k^4 must be blue. 3. By the Lemma, k^8 = (k^4)^2 is red. 4. However, k^8 is also the product of red numbers k^2 and k^6, which should yield a blue number, contradicting our previous conclusion. Case 2: Suppose k^3 is red. 1. Then k^5 = k^2 cdot k^3 is blue. 2. By the Lemma, k^{10} = (k^5)^2 is red. 3. Now, k^{10} = k^2 cdot k^8 = k^3 cdot k^7, implying that both k^7 and k^8 must be blue. 4. By the Lemma, k^{14} = (k^7)^2 and k^{16} = (k^8)^2 are red. 5. But this implies that k^{16} = k^2 cdot k^{14} is a product of red numbers, which should be blue, leading to a contradiction. After considering both cases, we find contradictions in each scenario. Conclusion: There cannot be a configuration where no two blue numbers differ by 1. Therefore, no two blue numbers may differ by exactly 1 and the assumption is false. [ boxed{text{No, it cannot happen.}} ]"},{"prompt":"a cinema in Hui City with 100 seats, ticket prices are uniform. According to the cinema's operational experience, if each ticket is priced at no more than 10 yuan, all tickets can be sold. For every 1 yuan increase in the ticket price above 10 yuan, 3 fewer tickets will be sold. To maximize revenue, a suitable ticket price needs to be set, with the following basic conditions: ① For ease of changemaking and accounting, the ticket price should be an integer multiple of 1 yuan; ② The cost of showing one movie in the cinema is 575 yuan, and the box office revenue must exceed this cost. Let x (yuan) denote the price per ticket, and y (yuan) represents the net income of the cinema for showing one film (after deducting the cost). (Ⅰ) Express y as a function of x and determine its domain; (Ⅱ) What should the ticket price be set at per ticket, under the conditions, to maximize the net income for screening a film?","completion":"Let's tackle each part of the problem step by step. (Ⅰ) According to the problem: - When x leq 10, all tickets are sold. So, the income function from ticket sales is y = 100x - 575. - When x > 10, for every 1 yuan increase, 3 tickets are unsold. Then the income function is y = [100 - 3(x - 10)]x - 575 = -3x^2 + 130x - 575. The income should be positive, so we have the inequalities: - For 100x - 575 > 0, we solve for x to find x > 5.75. - For -3x^2 + 130x - 575 > 0, we solve for x to get x < frac{130 + sqrt{130^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 575}}{2 cdot 3} = frac{130 + sqrt{10000}}{6} = frac{130}{3} approx 38.3. Since x represents the ticket price in whole yuan, we have 6 leq x leq 38. Thus, the function for net income y is: y = begin{cases} 100x - 575, & text{for } 6 leq x leq 10, -3x^2 + 130x - 575, & text{for } 10 < x leq 38, end{cases} and the domain is {x in mathbb{N} | 6 leq x leq 38}. (Ⅱ) For y = 100x - 575 with 6 leq x leq 10, the maximum net income occurs at x = 10, yielding y_{text{max}} = 425. For y = -3x^2 + 130x - 575 with 10 < x leq 38, we complete the square to find the vertex of the parabola: y = -3 left(x - frac{65}{3} right)^2 + frac{2500}{3} This quadratic function achieves its maximum at x = 22.

Step 2: Case analysis based on the center numbers Consider the numbers 6, 7, 10, and 11 as possible center placements: - These numbers allow a balanced distribution of the remaining numbers around them. - The numbers 2 to 5 must fill the top two rows and the first two columns other than the top-left corner. - The numbers 12 to 15 must fill the bottom two rows and the last two columns other than the bottom-right corner.

According to the second condition: M + X = 2(S + X) Now we can substitute the values of M and S that we know: 90 + X = 2(44 + X) Now, let's solve for X: 90 + X = 88 + 2X 90 - 88 = 2X - X 2 = X So, in boxed{2} years from now, the man's age will be twice the age of his son."},{"prompt":"w can you cut half a meter from a piece of fabric that is frac{2}{3} meters long if you have nothing to measure with?","completion":"Given that we need to cut a piece of cloth of length frac{2}{3} text{ meters to obtain a piece of } frac{1}{2} text{ meters without any measuring tools}, the process can be broken down as follows: 1. **Calculate the difference between the available and the desired lengths:** [ frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{2} ] To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator, which in this case is (6): [ frac{2}{3} = frac{2 times 2}{3 times 2} = frac{4}{6} ] [ frac{1}{2} = frac{1 times 3}{2 times 3} = frac{3}{6} ] Thus: [ frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{2} = frac{4}{6} - frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{6} ] 2. **Determine how to measure the leftover piece:** Consider dividing the original piece into four equal parts: [ frac{2}{3} div 4 ] When dividing a fraction by a whole number, we multiply by the reciprocal of the whole number: [ frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{4} = frac{2 times 1}{3 times 4} = frac{2}{12} = frac{1}{6} ] Hence, (frac{2}{3}) of a meter divided into four equal parts results in each part being (frac{1}{6}) of a meter. 3. **Implementation of the measurement process:** The solution suggests folding the (frac{2}{3}) meter piece of cloth into four equal parts. This folding results in each fold representing (frac{1}{6}) of a meter. By cutting one of these four parts off, the remaining cloth will be: [ frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{6} = frac{4}{6} - frac{1}{6} = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, by folding the ( frac{2}{3} ) meter piece into four equal parts and then cutting off one part, we obtain the required ( frac{1}{2} ) meter piece.

In the context of this problem, the center of mass of a given polygon refers to the center of mass of a homogeneous plate that has the shape of that polygon. The center of mass of an ( n )sided polygon refers to the center of mass of the ( n ) material points formed by placing equal masses at all the vertices of the ( n )sided polygon.","completion":"1. **Introduction of Variables and Problem Restatement**: We need to show that the centroid (center of gravity) of a triangular plate ABC is the point of intersection of its medians. Assume z is the distance from the centroid Z of triangle ABC to one of its sides, say AB. Let h be the altitude (height) dropped perpendicularly from vertex C to side AB. 2. **Subdivision and Similarity**: By joining the midpoints of the sides of triangle ABC, we create four smaller triangles. These triangles are similar to the original triangle and each have sides half the length of the corresponding sides of ABC. Denote these smaller triangles as T_1, T_2, T_3, and T_4 with their centroids as T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4} respectively. 3. **Distances from Side AB**: Let y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4} be the distances from the centroids T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4} to side AB.

The centroid Z is the average of the centroids of the four smaller triangles, giving us: [ z = frac{frac{z}{2} + frac{z}{2} + left(frac{h}{2} - frac{z}{2}right) + left(frac{h}{2} + frac{z}{2}right)}{4} ] Simplifying the above expression, we find: [ z = frac{frac{z}{2} + frac{z}{2} + frac{h}{2} - frac{z}{2} + frac{h}{2} + frac{z}{2}}{4} = frac{2z + h}{4} ] [ z = frac{2z + h}{4} ] [ 4z = 2z + h ] [ 2z = h ] [ z = frac{h}{3} ] 5. **Conclusion**: The centroid Z of a triangular plate ABC is located at a distance of frac{h}{3} from side AB. Since Z must also be at the same fraction of the heights from the other sides, the only point satisfying this for all sides simultaneously is the intersection of the medians. Hence, the centroid of the triangular plate is indeed the point of intersection of the medians. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let ( S ) be the set of all real numbers greater than 1.

Thus, when x in (-infty, -frac{b}{2}-1), f'(x) < 0, and when x in (-frac{b}{2}-1, +infty), f'(x) > 0. Hence, f(x) is decreasing on the interval (-infty, -frac{b}{2}-1) and increasing on (-frac{b}{2}-1, +infty). The domain of F(x) is (0, +infty), and its derivative F'(x) = b - frac{1}{x} = frac{bx - 1}{x}. Since b < 0, it follows that F'(x) < 0, which means F(x) is a decreasing function on its domain (0, +infty).

Any point M on the circle k lies on the plane S. A sphere G that passes through A and touches the plane S at point M must have its center P located appropriately. 2. **Properties and Conditions**: The center P of the sphere must lie on two specific loci: - The line perpendicular to plane S through M, denoted as m. - The perpendicular bisecting plane S_1 of the segment AM. Since there always exists a unique intersection between m and S_1 (because they are neither parallel nor can intersect otherwise), we deduce that there is a unique P for each M. This implies that the center P lies on a line or surface. 3. **Generating the Cylinder**: The line m, defined by standing perpendicular to S at M, forms one of the generators of a cylinder H whose base is the circle k and axis perpendicular to S. Therefore, P lies on this cylinder H. 4. **Intersection with an Additional Plane**: According to the problem’s statement, we need to show that P lies on another fixed plane. Specifically, since G must pass through a second fixed point, denoted by B, every sphere must intersect S_2, the perpendicular bisecting plane of the line segment AB. Therefore, P must lie at the intersection of H with S_2. 5. **Determining the Fixed Point B**: The equations involved reveal that, if OB is fixed and given OA = r, a common second point must exist.

Additionally, the argument confirms that this locus elaborates the geometric place of P, thus proving that the centers P of the spheres G form a distinct geometric place forming the ellipsis intersection within.

Here, we further analyze using geometric properties. - Denote O as the center of the Apollonius circle. - Consider the line segment AB intersecting the Apollonius circle at points M and N. 5. **Bisector and tangent condition**: The line segment CM bisects the angle angle ACB. This happens because M lies on the Apollonius circle, hence: [ frac{MB}{MA} = frac{CB}{CA} = frac{5}{13}. ] Since CM is the angle bisector, we also know: [ angle ACM + angle MCO = 90^circ, ] where CO is the radius perpendicular to the tangent at C. 6. **Circle properties in right angles**: By the circle properties and tangent perpendicularity (tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius CO), it follows that angle CBA is a right angle: [ angle CBA = 90^circ. ] 7. **Formulate using trigonometry**: - Using Pythagoras in triangle ABC: [ AB = sqrt{AC^2 - BC^2}. ] Given AC = 2.6 times BC, substituting: [ AB = BC sqrt{2.6^2 - 1} = BC sqrt{5.76 - 1} = BC sqrt{4.76} approx BC times 2.4. ] Rearranging gives: [ BC approx frac{5}{12} AB. ] 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, point C must be placed on the perpendicular from B to AB, at a distance of frac{5}{12} times AB from B. This ensures that the distance condition is met, and angle BAC is maximized (equal to 90^circ).

We will show that the area of this parallelogram is at most (frac{1}{2}). 1. **Assume maximal area for parallelogram:** To maximize the area of parallelogram (PQRS) inside ( triangle ABC ), we need to ensure at least two vertices of the parallelogram are on the sides of (triangle ABC). 2. **Vertices positioning:** - If the parallelogram has fewer than 2 vertices on the sides of the triangle, we can expand it until it has two points in contact with the sides, increasing its area. - If it had only two vertices on the sides, translating it slightly would make no vertices touch the sides, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, the parallelogram needs to have at least three vertices on the sides of (triangle ABC). 3. **Verification with three vertices condition:** Suppose the parallelogram has exactly three vertices on the sides of (triangle ABC): - Let’s assume the vertices (P, Q) lie on (BC), (R) lies on (CA), and (S) lies on (AB). - Translate (PQ) along (BC) until (P) coincides with vertex (B). This translation does not change the area. 4. **Splitting into similar triangles:** - Here, triangles (ASR) and (CQR) are similar to (triangle ABC). - The areas of these triangles are (left(frac{AR}{AC}right)^2) and (left(frac{CR}{AC}right)^2) of the area of (triangle ABC). 5. **Minimizing expression for maximal area:** To maximize the area of (PQRS): - We need to find the position of (R) on (AC) that minimizes (AR^2 + CR^2). - Since (CR = AC - AR), this minimizes to (2(AR - frac{AC}{2})^2 + frac{AC^2}{2}), which is minimized when (AR = frac{AC}{2}). Hence, (R) must be the midpoint of (AC). 6. **Calculation of area:** - With (R) at the midpoint of (AC), the area of (PQRS) is (frac{1}{2}) the area of (triangle ABC) given the symmetry. Thus, the area of parallelogram (PQRS) is ( frac{1}{2} times text{Area of } triangle ABC = frac{1}{2} ). 7. **Extension to any convex quadrilateral:** - Consider any convex quadrilateral (PQRS) inside triangle (ABC). - Let's take vertex (P) such that the ray (PQ) does not intersect (RS) and the ray (PS) does not intersect (QR). - Define point (X) as the intersection of lines parallel to (PQ) through (S) and parallel to (PS) through (Q). Then the triangle ( PQS ) forms half the area of the parallelogram (PQXS). Since (PQXS) has at most half the area of (triangle ABC), the area of ( triangle PQS ) is at most a quarter of ( triangle ABC).

We know that O lies on the angle bisector of angle AOC. Given conditions: - Line segment AO intersects BC at point L. - Line segment CO intersects AB at point K. - It is known that AK = CL. - We need to determine whether it is necessary that AB = BC. 1. **Consider Point O**: Since angle OAC = angle OCA, point O must be where the internal angle bisector of angle AOC intersects line AC. 2. **Analyzing the Triangle with Isosceles Condition**: Take an arbitrary isosceles obtuse triangle AOC such that AO = OC. Drop a perpendicular from C to AO which intersects AO at point H. Since AO = OC, triangle AOC is isosceles. 3. **Positioning of Point O**: Because angle AOC is obtuse, point O lies between point H (foot of the perpendicular) and point A. 4. **Constructing Points L_1 and K**: Let L_1 be an arbitrary point between O and H. Construct point K such that it is symmetric to L_1 with respect to the perpendicular dropped from C to AO. Here, angle L_1CA = angle L_1CO + angle OCA < 90^circ, thus ensuring angle KAC + angle L_1CA < 180^circ. Consequently, lines AK and CL_1 intersect. 5. **Determining Point B_1**: Since angle KAC + angle L_1CA < 180^circ, lines AK and CL_1 intersect at some point B_1 on the same side of line AC. By the symmetry, it is clear that triangle ACB_1 is isosceles. 6. **Reflecting L_1 to Obtain L**: Reflect L_1 about point H to get point L. Now, if we show that lines CL and AB_1 intersect at a point on the same side of line AC, we can construct the required non-isosceles triangle ABC. 7. **Trigonometric Relationships Evaluation**: Let angle OAC = a and angle KAO = b.

Let ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k ) denote the ( k ) pieces from left to right, and let ( S_i ) be the sum of all numbers on ( P_i ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). Let the sequence of sums be ( S = (S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k) ). 2. **Algorithm Description**: - **Step 1**: Find ( m le k ) such that ( S_m = max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ). - **Step 2**: If ( S_m - min{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} le 1 ), then we are done. - **Step 3**: If ( S_m - min{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} > 1 ), let ( P_a ) be the piece closest to ( P_m ) such that ( S_a = min{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ). If ( a < m ), we move the first number of ( P_{a+1} ) to ( P_a ), and if ( a > m ), we move the last number of ( P_{a-1} ) to ( P_a ). If ( |a - m| = 1 ), we proceed to Step 1, otherwise, we proceed to Step 2. Let the resulting sequence of sums be ( S' = (S_1', S_2', ldots, S_k') ). 3. **Analysis of Step 3**: - If ( a < m ), then ( S_{a+1}' < S_{a+1} le S_m ). - If ( a > m ), then ( S_{a-1}' < S_{a-1} le S_m ). - Also, ( S_a' = S_a + a_j le S_a + 1 < S_m ) for some ( j ). Thus, all sums ( S_i' ) are at most ( S_m ) and no new piece with sum ( S_m ) is created. Also, ( max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ) does not increase during the algorithm. 4. **Handling Empty Pieces**: - It is possible that one of the pieces ( P_h ) can become empty. Then since ( S_h = 0 = min{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ), the next time Step 3 is applied, ( a = h ) and ( P_h' ) would be non-empty, although it is possible that one of its neighbors would be empty. Thus, at any point in the algorithm, at most one piece can be empty. 5. **Proof of Termination**: - **Claim**: After applying Step 3 for a finite number of times, ( S_m ) would decrease. - **Proof**: Let ( t_1, t_2, ldots, t_k ) be the number of elements in ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k ). Then ( sum_{i=1}^k |i - m| t_i ) increases by 1 every time Step 3 is applied when ( S_m ) remains the same, and ( sum_{i=1}^k |i - m| t_i le sum_{i=1}^k (k-1)n = nk(k-1) ). Thus, ( S_m ) eventually has to decrease. 6. **Conclusion**: - When ( S_m ) decreases, the algorithm goes back to Step 1, and either ( max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ) decreases, or the number of pieces with a maximal sum decreases. Note that ( max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ) can only take finitely many values (at most ( 2^n )), so the algorithm eventually has to stop at Step 2, where ( max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} - min{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} le 1 ). 7. **Handling Final Empty Piece**: - In the final resulting sequence ( S = (S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k) ), if there is still an empty piece ( P_h ), i.e., ( S_h = 0 ), then all sums ( S_i ) are in ([0, 1]). Since there are ( k < n ) pieces, there must exist a piece with at least two elements. So we split that piece into two non-empty pieces and discard the empty piece. Since splitting the piece does not increase ( max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} ), the condition ( max{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} - min{S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k} le 1 ) is still satisfied, and we are done.

Clearly, the interior angle (angle A_1 < 180^circ). - At most 6 points can be within a distance of (sqrt{3}) from ( A_1 ).

Given these properties, we realize that: [ BM = MX = BX ] This makes (triangle BMX) an equilateral triangle. 3. **Establish Relationship of ( triangle BXM) with Other Triangles**: The properties of the equilateral triangle ( triangle BMX) help in relating it to other triangles in the given setup. Suppose ( K ) is such that ( angle BXK = 60^circ ). By constructing a similar setup, we can demonstrate that: [ angle BXK = angle CMA = 60^circ ] along with the sides: [ BX = BM = CM ] 4. **Establish More Congruences**: Equating segments based on the information provided, we notice that: [ XK = XM + MK = AK + MK = MA ] 5. **Reflect Point ( B ) to Find Point (Y)**: Reflect the vertex ( B ) with respect to the line ( AM ) to find point ( Y ). Noting that ( BM = MY ) and ( angle BMY = 120^circ ), we can infer that ( triangle CMY) is equilateral. 6. **Parallel lines and Important Parallelogram**: Since (AK) and (CY) are parallel and equal, the quadrilateral (AKYC) is a parallelogram. Also, considering symmetry and geometrical properties: [ AC = YK ] Reflecting back, (YK) is equal to (BK) by symmetry with respect to (AM). 7. **Construct Point (Z)**: Next, let’s mark the point ( Z ) such that (MCAZ) forms a parallelogram.

Let ( k geq 1 ) be the number of undetermined points ( c_{k,1}, c_{k,2}, ldots, c_{k,k} ) on the paper. 2. We construct a straight line segment ( l ) on the paper, external to the marked circle. 3. Choose ( k+1 ) points ( a_{k,1}, a_{k,2}, ldots, a_{k,k+1} ) on segment ( l ) such that ( a_{k,j} ) lies strictly between ( a_{k,j-1} ) and ( a_{k,j+1} ) for all ( j = 2,3, ldots, k ). 4. Measure the distances ( d_{k,1}, d_{k,2}, ldots, d_{k,k+1} ) from these points to the nearest undetermined point as reported by Misha. 5.

Skip those ( j ) for which such points ( b_{k,j} ) cannot be determined. 6. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair of points ( a_{k,j} ) and ( a_{k,m} ) (where ( 1 leq j < m leq k+1 )) must have the same closest undetermined point ( c_{k,i} ). So, for any point on segment ( [a_{k,j}, a_{k,m}] ), particularly for ( a_{k,j+1} ), the closest point ( c_{k,i} ) holds for ( i in {1, 2, dots, k} ). 7. Thus, ( c_{k,i} ) must align with one of the points ( b_{k,j} (j = 1,2, ldots, k) ). 8. Therefore, it is possible to determine one undetermined point using at most ( 2k+1 ) attempts for any given ( k ), which reduces the problem size. 9. By induction: - Base Case (( n=1 )): It takes ( 2k+1 = 3 leq (n+1)^2 ) attempts. - Inductive Step: Assume ( N ) undetermined points take less than ( (N+1)^2 ) attempts to determine. For ( n=N+1 ), finding one point takes ( 2N+3 ) attempts. By induction, in ( (N+1)^2+2N+3 = (N+2)^2 ) attempts maximum, all points can be resolved.

The existence of such primes is guaranteed by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which states that there are infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression (a + kn) where (a) and (n) are coprime. 3. **Analyze the gcd condition.** For (i > j), if (q^m mid gcd(a^{p_i} - b, a^{p_j} - b)), then: [ q^m mid a^{p_j} - b implies p_i equiv 1 pmod{phi(q^m)} ] This implies: [ 0 equiv a^{p_i} - b equiv a - b pmod{q^m} implies q^m mid a - b ] Therefore, the exponent (m) of a prime (q) dividing (a - b) in the factorization of (a^{p_i} - b) is not more than the exponent in (a - b). 4. **Choose a prime (q) dividing (a^{p_i} - b) with (gcd(q, b - a) = 1).** For such a prime (q), we have: [ text{Ord}_q(b) mid p_i text{Ord}_q(a) quad text{and} quad text{Ord}_q(a) mid text{Ord}_q(b) ] If (text{Ord}_q(b) neq text{Ord}_q(a)), then (text{Ord}_q(b) = p_i text{Ord}_q(a)).

We consider three cases: a>0, a=0, and a<0 to determine the range of values for the real number a. **Solution** For the function f(x)=x^3-3ax+a, taking the derivative yields f′(x)=3x^2−3a.

These segments do not intersect any of the five planes as ( O ) lies on all intersecting planes. - Consequently, each of these segments lies either in the interior or on the boundary of one of the resulting solids.

Since there are 5 balls and he does this process twice, the total number of outcomes is calculated as follows: - For the first pick, there are 5 possible outcomes (since there are 5 balls). - After putting the ball back, there are again 5 possible outcomes for the second pick. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 5 times 5 = 25. Next, we need to identify the outcomes where the product of the two numbers is even and greater than 10. To achieve an even product, at least one of the numbers must be even. In this set of numbers (1 through 5), the even numbers are 2 and 4. However, multiplying 2 by any of the numbers (1 through 5) will not give a product greater than 10. Therefore, the only way to get an even product greater than 10 is by including the number 4 in the draw. Given this, we need to find combinations where at least one of the numbers is 4, and the product is greater than 10.

By isolating ( m ) from the relationship, we obtain: [ m = frac{kr}{a} ] This gives us a ratio of ( m ) to ( k ) and ( r ) to ( a ): [ frac{m}{k} = frac{r}{a} ] Step 2: Construct Key Segments To proceed with the construction: 1. Draw a circle with radius ( r ) which will be the inscribed circle of the triangle. 2. From a point outside the circle, draw two tangents to the circle. These tangents will represent parts of the sides of the triangle. Step 3: Determine the Tangent Lengths The lengths of the tangents are derived as follows: [ text{Length of each tangent} = frac{k}{2} - a ] These tangents are crucial because: - They will determine the directions of two sides of the triangle. - The distance from the point of tangency to the vertex where the tangents intersect will equal ( frac{k}{2} - a ). Step 4: Construct the Third Side To determine the third side's length: 1. Recognize that the third side will be a segment joining the points where the tangents intersect the circle. 2. Draw another circle with radius ( m = frac{kr}{a} ) centered at the vertex known from the previous steps. Step 5: Common Tangent as the Third Side The third side of the triangle is the common tangent to: - The given circle of radius ( r ). - The new circle centered at the known vertex with radius ( m ). Conclusion Finally, the problem may not be solvable if a common tangent cannot be drawn. This is the case where the given circle of radius ( r ) is entirely within the new circle of radius ( m ) without touching it. Thus, the construction relies heavily on the ability to draw tangents and measure segments precisely based on the given parameters ( k ), ( a ), and ( r ).

Consequently, ( 2N = n - 2 ). 4. **Analyzing boundedness and arriving at contradiction**: - Let ( M ) be the maximum value of ( f ) on the interval ( (x_1, x_n) ). Since ( f ) is continuous, ( M ) is finite. - Because ( f ) takes every real value exactly ( n ) times, upon considering ( M + 1 ): - ( f ) cannot take the value ( M + 1 ) before ( x_1 ) or after ( x_n ) because this would force ( f ) to repeat some value (breaking the constraint). - Given the nature of ( M ), ( f ) cannot take the value ( M + 1 ) within ((x_1, x_n)) either. - This leads us to a contradiction since we assumed ( f ) takes each real value exactly ( n ) times. # Conclusion: - Thus, the function ( f ) cannot exist for even values of ( n ), and consequently: [ boxed{text{odd } n} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine the number of polynomials of the form a_0x^n + a_1x^{n1} + cdots + a_{n1}x + a_n where the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients plus the degree of the polynomial equals 5.

We can represent the tournament as a directed graph where each player is a vertex, and there is a directed edge from vertex (A) to vertex (B) if player (A) beats player (B). We need to prove that the maximal oriented path contains all the vertices. 1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose the maximal oriented path does not contain all the vertices. Then, we can divide the set of vertices into two disjoint sets, (U) and (V), where (U) contains the vertices from the maximal path and (V) contains the others. Denote the path as (A_1 rightarrow A_2 rightarrow ldots rightarrow A_k). 2. **Properties of vertices in (V)**: Every player in (V) either loses or draws with (A_1) and beats or draws with (A_k) due to the maximality of the path. 3. **No player can have two draws**: Suppose a player (A) draws with both (B) and (C). If (B) defeats (C), then for the drawing pair (A, C), we have a vertex (B) who does not lose to either (A) or (C), which is impossible. Therefore, a player cannot have two draws. 4. **No draws within (V)**: Suppose (X, Y in V) draw. Then (A_1) must lose to one of them, and we can find a longer path (V rightarrow A_1 rightarrow ldots rightarrow A_k), contradicting the maximality of the path. 5. **Constructing the path**: Start from (A_k). Check if (A_k) beats someone from (V). If not, move to (A_{k-1}) and so on. If (A_i) beats someone from (V), say (X), then (X) cannot have drawn with (A_{i+1}) (since (i < k)) for obvious reasons. Therefore, (X) must have won against (A_{i+1}), allowing us to extend our path, which is impossible. 6. **Reaching (A_1)**: If we never stop, we reach (A_1) and find that nobody from (U) won over someone from (V). Since (A_1) cannot lose to someone from (V), (A_1) must draw with everyone from (V). However, (A_1) can have at most one draw, so (V) has exactly one vertex, (Y). 7. **Analyzing (Y)**: (Y) cannot draw with (A_k) since no player can have two draws. (Y) cannot lose to (A_k) because that would allow us to find a longer path. Therefore, (A_k) must lose to (Y). 8. **Draw within (U)**: If there is a draw within (U), say between (L) and (M), then one of (L) or (M) must defeat (V) (since (V) cannot take any more draws), which is impossible because we are in case 2.

Therefore, the center of the circle is C(1, -2), and the radius is r = 3. (2) Suppose the circle with diameter AB is circle M, and the center of M has coordinates (a, b). Since CM perp l, the product of their slopes is k_{CM} cdot k_{l} = -1, which means frac{b+2}{a-1} cdot 1 = -1, so a + b + 1 = 0 (1). The line l passes through the point M(a, b), so the equation of l can be written as y - b = x - a, or x - y + b - a = 0. Hence, |CM| = frac{|b-a+3|}{sqrt{2}}. Moreover, since the circle M with diameter AB passes through the origin, |MA|=|MB|=|OM|. Now, |MB|^2 = |CB|^2 - |CM|^2 = 9 - left(frac{|b-a+3|}{sqrt{2}}right)^2, and |OM|^2 = a^2 + b^2.

Solving simultaneously with x = 3, we find S(3, 5k). Let P be (x_0, y_0). Substituting this into the ellipse equation, we have frac{x_0^2}{4} + frac{y_0^2}{1} = 1 (x_0 neq pm 2).

The trapezoid has one of its angles at the larger base (AD) equal to 45^circ. We need to cut this trapezoid into three pieces and rearrange them to form a square.

Suppose (d) is the greatest common divisor of (a) and (b). Then (d mid a) and considering (a mid b^2 + b + 1), it follows that (d mid 1). Hence, (d = 1), showing that (a) and (b) are relatively prime. 3. **Reduction to a Simpler Condition**: From this, we infer that if (a) and (b) are such that (ab) divides (a^2 + b^2 + a + b + 1), then both (a mid b^2 + b + 1) and (b mid a^2 + a + 1) hold true.

Let us consider one diagonal to demonstrate the general scenario: Let a diagonal be divided into two equal segments by a midpoint lying on ( k ). 5. **Analyzing Possible Configurations**: Assume that from each vertex of the polygon, at most two diagonals have midpoints on ( k ). Since each diagonal is considered twice (once from each end), there be at most 1976 such midpoints. 6. **Examining Special Case**: Let us consider if this is not the case and a vertex ( A ) has the midpoints of at least three diagonals on ( k ). - Three distinct midpoints of diagonals starting from ( A ) would uniquely determine ( k ). - If the circle ( k ) is scaled down from the circumscribed circle of the polygon, it will exactly pass through the same midpoints. 7. **Thalès's Theorem Application**: For each diagonal touching ( A ), the midpoints of these diagonals must lie on a circle passing through a diameter, implying: - The circle must pass through the center ( O ) of the polygon's circumscribed circle and the point ( A ). 8. **Conclusion**: Thus, the circle ( k ) determined by vertices through which the diagonals pass would contain at most 1975 midpoints of diagonals passing through a vertex plus the center ( O ). 9. **Bounded Solution**: Therefore, the maximum number of midpoints of sides and diagonals on a single circle cannot exceed 1976.

This implies that the maximum value of the sum of these terms occurs at the boundary points of the interval ([0,1]). Therefore, each ( x_i ) should be either 0 or 1 to maximize the sum. 3. **Considering the Boundary Points:** Suppose there are ( k ) zeros and ( n-k ) ones among the ( n ) numbers. We need to calculate the sum: [ sum_{i<j} |x_i - x_j|. ] If ( x_i = 0 ) and ( x_j = 1 ), then ( |x_i - x_j| = 1 ). The number of such pairs is ( k(n-k) ), because each zero can pair with each one. 4. **Maximizing the Sum:** The sum ( k(n-k) ) is a quadratic function in ( k ). To find the maximum value, we can complete the square or use calculus. The function ( k(n-k) ) is maximized when ( k = frac{n}{2} ). - If ( n ) is even, ( k = frac{n}{2} ). - If ( n ) is odd, ( k ) can be either ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ) or ( leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil ). 5. **Calculating the Maximum Value:** - For even ( n ): [ k = frac{n}{2}, quad text{so} quad k(n-k) = left(frac{n}{2}right)left(frac{n}{2}right) = frac{n^2}{4}. ] - For odd ( n ): [ k = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor quad text{or} quad k = leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil. ] Both values of ( k ) will give: [ k(n-k) = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor left( n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor right) = leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil left( n - leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil right). ] This value is also approximately (frac{n^2}{4}). 6. **Conclusion:** The maximum value of the sum (sum_{i<j} |x_i - x_j|) is (leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor).

The areas 16, 25, and 36 suggest sides proportional to 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The total area of the smaller triangles sum up to 16 + 25 + 36 = 77. Since each smaller triangle shares the same angle at Q and is similar to triangle DEF, the side lengths of the larger triangle are sums of proportional sides of the smaller ones, which are 4x + 5x + 6x = 15x for each side. Thus, each side of triangle DEF can be divided into segments of 4x, 5x, and 6x around the triangle. Given the similarity ratio, the entire triangle's area is proportional to the square of the sum of the proportional sides of the smaller triangles. The ratio is (4+5+6)^2 = 15^2.

We start by checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers. - **Divisibility by 2**: 1800 is even, so it is divisible by 2. We keep dividing by 2 until we get an odd number: [ 1800 div 2 = 900, quad 900 div 2 = 450, quad 450 div 2 = 225 ] Thus, 1800 = 2^3 times 225. - **Divisibility by 3**: 225 is divisible by 3 (since 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3): [ 225 div 3 = 75 ] Then, continue dividing by 3: [ 75 div 3 = 25 ] Thus, 225 = 3^2 times 25. - **Divisibility by 5**: Finally, 25 is divisible by 5: [ 25 div 5 = 5 quad text{and} quad 5 div 5 = 1 ] Thus, 25 = 5^2.

We aim to prove that the ratio ( lambda = frac{d_{text{max}}}{d_{text{min}}} ) satisfies ( lambda geq 2 sin 54^circ ), and we will discuss the necessary conditions for equality. 2. **Geometric Configuration and Analysis**: - Consider that the five given points can form a convex pentagon. A convex pentagon has interior angles summing to ( 540^circ ), implying that each internal angle is no less than ( 108^circ ). - Let point ( A ) be the vertex with the largest internal angle in this pentagon, and let ( B ) and ( C ) be the adjacent vertices to ( A ). 3. **Triangle Inequality**: - In ( triangle ABC ), the internal angle at ( A ) is the largest, and thus (frac{1}{2} theta_A + theta_C leq 90^circ), leading to (theta_C leq 90^circ - frac{1}{2} theta_A). - Given that (sin) function is increasing for acute angles, we get: [ sin theta_C leq sin left(90^circ - frac{1}{2} theta_A right) = cos frac{1}{2} theta_A. ] 4. **Applying the Sine Rule**: - Applying the sine rule in ( triangle ABC ): [ frac{a}{c} = frac{sin theta_A}{sin theta_C} geq frac{sin theta_A}{cos frac{1}{2} theta_A}. ] - Using the identity (cos x = sin (90^circ - x)), we rewrite it as: [ frac{a}{c} geq frac{sin theta_A}{cos frac{1}{2} theta_A} = 2 sin frac{1}{2}theta_A. ] - Given (theta_A geq 108^circ), (frac{1}{2}theta_A geq 54^circ), thus yielding: [ 2 sin 54^circ leq 2 sin 54^circ. ] 5. **Establishing the Ratio**: - Denote ( d_{text{max}} = p ) and ( d_{text{min}} = q ). Thus, the ratio (lambda) is given by: [ lambda = frac{p}{q}. ] - Using our inequality, ( frac{a}{c} geq 2 sin 54^circ ), consequently, we have: [ lambda geq frac{a}{c} geq 2 sin 54^circ. ] 6. **Assessing Other Cases**: - If the five points cannot form a convex pentagon, then other configurations fall into two categories: - **Case (i)**: There exist three collinear points among the five points, say ( A, B, C ), where ( B ) lies between ( A ) and ( C ). This setting clearly shows: [ frac{|AC|}{min(|AB|, |BC|)} geq 2 > 2sin 54^circ. ] - **Case (ii)**: There exists a point ( P ) inside the triangle formed by other three points, ( triangle ABC ), leading to at least one angle (geq 120^circ): Using the earlier proof,: [ lambda geq 2 sin 60^circ > 2 sin 54^circ. ] 7. **Necessary Condition for Equality**: - If equality ( lambda = 2 sin 54^circ ) holds, the five points must form a regular pentagon. Each angle ( theta_A = 108^circ ) and adjacent equal angles (theta_B = theta_C) ensure this condition, making ( triangle ABC ) equilateral. 8. **Conclusion**: - Based on the above analysis, we conclude that the five points forming a regular pentagon strictly satisfies: [ lambda geq 2 sin 54^circ. ] [ boxed{2 sin 54^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Tickets to the school's dinner theatre cost 6 dollars for children and a certain amount for adults. 225 tickets were sold for a total of 1875 dollars, and 50 children attended.

Let ( x_n = overline{aa ldots ab} ), where the digit 'a' appears ( n ) times. We will analyze two cases based on whether ( x_1 ) and 10 are relatively prime. **Case 1: ( x_1 ) and 10 are not relatively prime** If ( x_1 ) and 10 share a common prime factor (which can only be 2 or 5), then this prime factor divides ( x_1 ), and consequently, it will divide every ( x_n ) in the sequence. This can be shown by the following equation: [ x_n = x_1 + 10 left( 10 + 10^2 + 10^3 + ldots + 10^{n-1} right) a ] We observe that ( x_1 ) and the sum ( 10 ( 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{n-1} ) ) share the same divisors 2 and/or 5 that divide 10. Hence each ( x_n ) is composite as it is divisible by 2 or 5. **Case 2: ( x_1 ) and 10 are relatively prime** We will show that there exist infinitely many positive integers ( n ) for which ( x_n ) is divisible by ( x_1 ). First, we need to show that there exists a positive integer ( m ) such that ( 1 + 10 + 10^2 + cdots + 10^{m-1} ) is divisible by ( x_1 ). Consider the sequence ( y_1 = 1, y_2 = 11, y_3 = 111, ldots ). From this sequence, choose two elements, ( y_k ) and ( y_l ), that leave the same remainder when divided by ( x_1 ). Such elements exist due to the Pigeonhole Principle because the remainders can be only a finite number of types while the sequence has infinitely many terms. Assume: [ y_k equiv y_l mod x_1 ] where ( k < l ). Thus: [ y_l - y_k = 10^k(1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{l-k-1}) ] Since ( x_1 ) and 10 are relatively prime, ( x_1 ) divides ( (1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{l-k-1}) ). Let: [ m = l - k ] Then, for any positive integer ( k ): [ x_{km+1} = x_1 + left(10^2 + 10^3 + cdots + 10^{km+1}right) a ] Simplifies to: [ x_{km+1} = x_1 + 100aleft(1 + 10^m + 10^{2m} + ldots + 10^{(k-1)m}right)left(1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{m-1}right) ] Having the term ( 100a left( ldots right) left( ldots right) ) ensures: [ x_{km+1} equiv 0 mod x_1 ] Hence, ( x_{km+1} ) is divisible by ( x_1 ) and therefore composite. Thus, there are infinitely many composite numbers in the sequence. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that the number ( 6^{2n} + 3^{n+2} + 3^{n} ) for any nonnegative integer ( n ) is divisible by 11.","completion":": To prove that the number 6^{2n} + 3^{n+2} + 3^n is divisible by 11 for all non-negative integers n, we will follow these steps: 1. **Express each term in a form that simplifies using modular arithmetic**: [ 6^{2n} + 3^{n+2} + 3^n ] 2. **Simplify the expression 6^{2n} modulo 11**: Recall that 6 equiv -5 pmod{11}.

The angle angle ACB formed at the center by these intersection points is 60^circ because the radius is perpendicular to the tangent (x-axis) at the point of contact. The region where the point can fall below the x-axis is a circular segment, which can be thought of as the area of a sector with a central angle of 60^circ minus the area of an equilateral triangle formed by points A, B, and C. The area of this circular sector is frac{1}{6} of the circle's total area because frac{60^circ}{360^circ} = frac{1}{6}. The area of the circle is pi r^2, where r is the radius. Given the equation of the circle, the radius r is 2, so the area of the circle is 4pi. Now, we calculate the area of the equilateral triangle, which has side length 2r.

We define two counters as neighbors if they are in the same row or column and there are no other counters between them. The task is to determine the maximum number of counters that can be placed on the board such that each counter has at most three neighbors. Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Initial Considerations**: - Each counter can have at most three neighbors, meaning in at least one direction (left, right, up, down), there is no other counter. This can be thought of as the counter \\"looking out of a window\\" on the perimeter of the chessboard where the \\"window\\" is the outer edge (perimeter) of the board. - We can first place counters at the corners of the board. Counters in the corners do not block any other counter’s view because they are at the extreme ends. 2. **Counting Edges**: - The perimeter (or outer frame) of the chessboard has a length calculated by 2(n + k) - 4: this is the sum of the lengths of all sides minus the four corners, which are counted twice. 3. **Placement of Counters**: - We start by placing four counters at the four corners. Each of these counters takes up a corner \\"window\\" and does not interfere with other counters’ views. - Placing these four corner counters covers 8 of the total \\"windows\\" from our perimeter calculation. 4. **Remaining Windows**: - After covering the corners, we are left with 2(n + k) - 8 windows. 5. **Filling in Remaining Counters**: - Ideally, we would fill the remaining positions on the perimeter without having any counters overlap views. - Therefore, every remaining counter will look out of exactly one of these remaining windows. 6. **Optimal Calculation**: - Each counter on the edge can be positioned such that it looks out one window. For example, Place counters along the edges, and they will cover the bandwidth of view without overlapping in views too much. # Concrete Calculation: - For any chessboard with n, k geq 2: - Maximum number of counters = 2(n + k) - 4. For chessboards with very short dimensions: - **Case n = 1 or k = 1**: - Here, each position can hold a counter, and each counter has at most two neighbors (to the left and right, or above and below). # Verification: - Through the second solution, we refine the considerations by marking each counter: - Mark each counter that is the topmost in its column: a maximum of n counters. - Mark each counter that is the bottommost in its column: another maximum of n counters. - Mark each counter that is the leftmost in its row: a maximum of k counters. - Mark each counter that is the rightmost in its row: another maximum of k counters. - Since each corner can be marked twice, we subtract the 4 double-counted corners.

Consider the given problem where M is the midpoint of the arc AB of the circumcircle of triangle ABC that does not contain point C, and N is the midpoint of the arc BC of the circumcircle of triangle ABC that does not contain point A. 2. By definition, midpoints of arcs in the circumcircle of a triangle have significant symmetrical properties. Notably, these points are associated with the Lemma on the Three-leaf Clover (Lemmas o Trilistnike), which states that special centers such as the circumcenter, incenter, excenters, and arc midpoints of a triangle form isosceles triangles with respect to each other. 3. Let us denote by O the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Note that O is equidistant from A, B, and C. Consequently, the points M and N lie on a circle centered at O due to the property that they are midpoints of arcs in this circumcircle not containing the respective opposite vertex. 4. Now, center O also implies that the line segment from the center O to the midpoint of an arc is perpendicular to the chord connecting the endpoints of the arc. This means: [ OM perp AB quad text{and} quad ON perp BC ] 5. From the lemma mentioned above, the line IZ is a critical bisector. Here, I denotes the incenter, and Z is another crucial point related to the angular bisections. 6. Given that P and Q are points such that PQ perp IZ as confirmed in previous steps, and knowing that: [ PQ perp BI ] we recognize that PQ has a specific perpendicular relationship with respect to incenter I.

Since B's monthly income is 12% more than C's monthly income, we can calculate it as follows: B's monthly income = C's monthly income + (12% of C's monthly income) B's monthly income = Rs. 16000 + (0.12 * Rs. 16000) B's monthly income = Rs. 16000 + Rs. 1920 B's monthly income = Rs. 17920 Now, let's find A's monthly income. We know A's annual income, so we can find the monthly income by dividing the annual income by 12 (the number of months in a year): A's monthly income = A's annual income / 12 A's monthly income = Rs. 537600 / 12 A's monthly income = Rs. 44800 Now we have both A's and B's monthly incomes, so we can find the ratio of A's monthly income to B's monthly income: Ratio = A's monthly income : B's monthly income Ratio = Rs. 44800 : Rs. 17920 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both sides by the greatest common divisor. In this case, we can divide both numbers by Rs. 17920 to find the simplest form of the ratio: Ratio = (Rs. 44800 / Rs. 17920) : (Rs. 17920 / Rs. 17920) Ratio = 2.5 : 1 However, ratios are typically expressed in whole numbers.

Substituting a = m + n = frac{1}{n} + n and m = frac{1}{n} into the above expression gives M(a) = 2[(frac{1}{n} + n)ln n + (frac{1}{n} - n)].

We assign each seat a number from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2n}). 2. Let ( pi ) be a permutation of the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2n}), representing the new seating arrangement after the break. Specifically, (pi(k)) denotes the seat number that the participant originally sitting at seat ( k ) moves to. 3. We need to show that there exist distinct indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that the number of participants between them before and after the break is the same when the differences are calculated modulo ( 2n ). This translates to proving there are ( i ) and ( j ) with ( | pi(i) - pi(j) | equiv | i - j | mod 2n ). 4. First, consider the possibility where the differences ( pi(i) - i ) are distinct modulo ( 2n ). In this scenario, the values taken by ( pi(i) - i mod 2n ) are precisely ( 0, 1, ldots, 2n-1 ). 5. Calculate the sum of these differences: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (pi(i) - i). ] Since (pi) is a permutation, it reorders the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 2n ). Hence, [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} pi(i) = sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = n(2n+1). ] 6. Therefore, [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (pi(i) - i) = sum_{i=1}^{2n} pi(i) - sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = n(2n+1) - n(2n+1) = 0. ] However, if the differences ( pi(i) - i ) are distinct and take all values ( 0, 1, ldots, 2n-1 ), then: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (pi(i) - i) equiv 0 + 1 + cdots + (2n-1) equiv frac{(2n-1)2n}{2} equiv n(2n-1) mod 2n. ] 7.

Because ( n(2n-1) ) modulo ( 2n ) is not zero but the sum was calculated as zero, we encounter a contradiction. 9. Hence, the assumption that all differences (pi(i) - i) are distinct modulo ( 2n ) is false, meaning there must be some (i neq j) where (pi(i) - i equiv pi(j) - j mod 2n). 10.

We need to prove that if a \\"perfect number\\" greater than 6 is divisible by 3, then it must also be divisible by 9. 2. **Expressing the Perfect Number:** Suppose the \\"perfect number\\" ( P ) can be expressed as ( P = 3n ), where ( n ) is not a multiple of 3 (since otherwise ( P ) could already easily be seen to be divisible by 9). 3. **Finding Divisors:** Every factor of ( 3n ) can be paired into a form of pairs like ( (d, frac{3n}{d}) ). Notice: [ 1 cdot 3n, quad d cdot (3n/d) = 3n ] Here, ( d ) is a divisor of ( n ) which is not divisible by 3. The other pair ( 3d ) is divisible by 3, but not by ( n ). 4. **Summing Divisors:** The sum of all divisors of ( 3n ), including itself, can be expressed as: [ 1 + 3n + sum_{d mid n, d neq n} (d + 3d) ] Simplifying the sum of the divisors not including ( 3n ): [ S = sum_{d mid n, d neq n} (d + 3d) = sum_{d mid n, d neq n} 4d ] Since the sum equals ( 6n ), we conclude ( 6n ) is the total sum of divisors of ( P = 3n ). 5. **Finding Factors of ( n ):** Suppose ( n ) must be divisible by 2 (since the sum of divisors ( 6n ) indicates that every divisor when summed must contribute to making ( n ) divisible by 2). 6. **Testing ( n ) for Perfection:** We observe that if ( n ) is of the form ( frac{3n}{2}, n, frac{n}{2}, 1 ) these should be distinct divisors summing up to more than ( 3n ). But noting: [ frac{3n}{2} + n + frac{n}{2} + 1 = 3n+1 > 3n ] This summation includes more than ( 3n ), and hence ( 3n ) cannot be a perfect number in this derived contradiction. # Conclusion: Since ( n ) must be divisible by 3 to prevent contradiction which leads: [ 3n text{if and only if} n = text{multiple of 6 including divisibility by 9} ] Thus the initial numbers greater than 6 when fully factorized and verified must invariably be divisible by 9 to satisfy perfect sums.

Thus, for a given polynomial P of degree d with leading coefficient a_d, we need: [ Pleft(frac{10^n - 1}{9}right) = frac{10^{k_n} - 1}{9} ] for some integer k_n dependent on n. 3. **Behavior at infinity:** Consider the behavior of P as n to infty. For large n, since P(x) is dominated by its leading term, we approximate: [ Pleft(frac{10^n - 1}{9}right) approx a_d left(frac{10^n - 1}{9}right)^d ] 4. **Rewrite the approximation:** [ a_d left(frac{10^n - 1}{9}right)^d = a_d cdot frac{(10^n - 1)^d}{9^d} ] 5. **Condition for \\"sympa\\" form:** For the result to be \\"sympa\\", we need: [ a_d cdot frac{(10^n - 1)^d}{9^d} = frac{10^{k_n} - 1}{9} ] 6. **Find leading behavior 10^{kn}:** Equate leading terms and solve for k_n: [ frac{a_d cdot 10^{nd}}{9^d} approx frac{10^{k_n}}{9} ] which simplifies to: [ a_d cdot 10^{nd} approx 10^{k_n - 1} cdot 9^{d - 1} ] 7. **Compare exponents:** Thus, we need: [ nd approx k_n - 1 + (d-1) log_{10} 9 = k_n - 1 + (d-1) cdot log_{10} 3^2 ] Therefore, [ k_n approx nd + C ] for some constant C. Since k_n has to be an integer, we find: [ k_n = nd + a ] for some integer a. 8. **Final polynomial condition:** Therefore, the polynomial P must be: [ P(x) = frac{10^a}{9} (9x + 1)^d - frac{1}{9} ] 9. **Conclusion and check:** Verify that this polynomial works for all d geq 1 and a in mathbb{Z}, and it indeed produces \\"sympa\\" integers when the input is a \\"sympa\\" integer.

Juli 1956 auf dem Newport Jazz Festival in Newport (Rhode Island) und bei einer anschließenden Studiosession am 9. Juli aufgenommen und bei Columbia Records veröffentlicht wurde. 1999 erschien eine erweiterte und überarbeitete Ausgabe des Mitschnitts auf der Grundlage wiederentdeckter Tonbänder des Mitschnitts von Voice of America., Das Konzert., Vorgeschichte des Newport-Auftritts., Nachdem das Duke Ellington Orchestra Anfang der 1950er Jahre durch den Aufstieg des Bebop und des Cool Jazz erheblich an Popularität eingebüßt hatte, feierte es auf dem Newport Jazz Festival im Juli 1956 ein triumphales, stürmisch gefeiertes Comeback; nur wenige Wochen nach seinem Auftritt trug eine Ausgabe des \\"Time\\"-Magazins seine Abbildung auf der Titelseite. Der \\"Time\\"-Artikel, eine besondere Ehrung für Ellington, war schon lange vorher geplant, erhielt aber durch den Erfolg Ellingtons in Newport eine zusätzliche Aktualität, er setzte Ellington aber auch vor dem Konzert unter Druck. Duke Ellington hatte –während andere große Big Bands in den 1950er Jahren aufgeben mussten– sein Orchester weiter am Leben erhalten können. Dies war ihm vor allem durch die Einnahmen aus den Urheberrechten seiner zahlreichen Kompositionen möglich., Das Duke Ellington Orchestra ging Anfang der 1950er Jahre auf einige Europatourneen, erlebte aber ansonsten eine Phase der künstlerischen Stagnation. Es hatte aber einige wichtige Zugänge an Musikern, so den Schlagzeuger Sam Woodyard und den Saxophonisten Paul Gonsalves, der die Rolle und teilweise auch den Stil von Ben Webster weiter verfolgte; außerdem war kurz zuvor Johnny Hodges in Ellingtons Orchester zurückgekehrt. Der Ellington-Biograph James Lincoln Collier sieht in Gonsalves den Mann, der schließlich „mit einem Schlag alles herumriss.“, Der Newport-Auftritt des Duke Ellington Orchesters 1956., Im Jahr 1956 lud ihn George Wein dazu ein, auf dem zwei Jahre vorher neu etablierten \\"Newport Jazz Festival\\" aufzutreten, bei dem Ellington schon 1955 als Master of Ceremonies auftrat. Duke Ellington spielte vorab in kleinerer Besetzung mit seinem Orchester einige einleitende Nummern, \\"Black and Tan Fantasy\\" und den Jazzstandard \\"Tea for Two\\". Zur großen Besetzung fehlten in der Band die Bläser Jimmy Hamilton, Ray Nance, Clark Terry und der Bassist Jimmy Woode, für den Al Lucas einsprang., Nach den Auftritten einiger anderer Künstler, wie Bud Shank, Jimmy Giuffre und dem aus Wien angereisten Friedrich Gulda, spielte lange das Chico Hamilton Orchester. Die eher intellektuelle Spielhaltung \\"(Cool Jazz)\\" dieser Gruppen löste beim Publikum keine Begeisterung aus. Der zweite Auftritt der Ellington-Band war für 22:30 Uhr vorgesehen, auf ihn hatten sich Ellington und Billy Strayhorn mit einer eigens geschriebenen Suite vorbereitet. Die vorhergehenden Konzerte ließen es jedoch immer später werden. Vom langen Warten war die Stimmung seiner Musiker gereizt; auch Ellington selbst reagierte verärgert: „Wer sind wir denn eigentlich – die Tiernummer, die Akrobaten?“., So kam das Ellington-Orchester dann erst um 23:45 Uhr in voller Besetzung auf die Bühne. Duke Ellington leitete den Auftritt mit \\"Take the “A” Train\\" ein; es folgte eine neue Komposition von Ellington und Billy Strayhorn, die für das Festival geschaffene dreiteilige \\"Newport Jazz Festival Suite\\", die stark vom Blues geprägt war. Sie war eine Auftragsarbeit von Columbia’s Produzent George Avakian. Der erste Teil, genannt „Festival Junction“ wurde mit einem langsamen Klarinettensolo von Jimmy Hamilton eingeleitet, bevor das Ensemblespiel einsetzte, gefolgt von Soli von Willie Cook, Paul Gonsalves, Britt Woodman, Harry Carney, Quentin Jackson, Russell Procope; Trompeter Cat Anderson mit seinem kurzen, in höchste Register steigenden Solo setzte den Schlusspunkt. Der zweite Teil hatte die Bezeichnung „Blues to Be There“ und wurde von Duke Ellington (in Triobesetzung) eingeleitet; es folgte langsam-getragenes Ensemblespiel mit Soli von Procope und Ray Nance. Mit dem abschließenden dritten Teil „Newport Up“ zog das Tempo an; es spielten als Solisten Hamilton, Gonsalves (der sich warm spielte) und Clark Terry. Es war die einzige Stelle, an der das Ellington-Orchester vom Blues-Schema abwich. Das \\"Bop-gefärbte\\" Ende stammte von Clark Terry. Ellingtons Suite war als Auftakt gedacht, doch die Begeisterung des Publikums hielt sich in Grenzen; es gab „soliden, wenn auch nicht überwältigenden Applaus“., Nach der \\"Newport Suite\\" gab Ellington Harry Carney Gelegenheiten für ein Baritonsaxophon Solo über \\"Sophisticated Lady\\"; danach spielte das Orchester \\"Day In, Day Out\\". Nun sagte Duke Ellington an, man werde ein altes Stück aus den 1930er Jahren, „some of our 1938 vintage“, die Blues-Titel \\"Diminuendo in Blue\\" und \\"Crescendo in Blue\\" spielen, und kündigte Paul Gonsalves als Solisten an., Ellington hatte schon einige Jahre zuvor an einer Vereinigung der Stücke (\\"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue\\") gearbeitet, so bei seinen Carnegie-Hall-Konzerten („Transbluecency“) Mitte der 1940er Jahre. Für den Newport-Auftritt hatte er Paul Gonsalves als Protagonisten ausgewählt; dieser wusste jedoch nicht, was er eigentlich tun sollte. Collier zitiert Ellingtons ironische Anweisung an seinen Saxophonisten: „‘Es ist einfach ein Blues in B’ (In Wirklichkeit in Des), sagte Ellington, ‘ich bring dich rein und hol dich wieder raus. Das ist alles, was du zu machen hast. Geh’ nur raus und blas’ dir die Seele aus dem Leib. Du hast es ja schon mal gemacht’“. Ellington sprach damit vorangegangene Interpretationen des Stücks bei einem Gastspiel im New Yorker Birdland im Jahre 1951 an, und auch damals riss Gonsalves das Publikum hin., Es war vorgesehen, Gonsalves zwischen den beiden arrangierten Teilen des Stücks, nur von der Rhythmusgruppe aus Jimmy Woode, Sam Woodyard und Ellington begleitet, sein Solo spielen zu lassen. J. L. Collier erwähnt, dass außerhalb des Blickfeldes des Publikums, aber in der Nähe der Bühne, wo die Band ihn sehen konnte, der Basie-Schlagzeuger Jo Jones saß und den Takt mit einer gerollten Zeitung schlug. Ellington spielte gegen Ende des ersten Teils ein Klaviersolo, damit Gonsalves Gelegenheit hatte, nach vorn zu kommen. Paul Gonsalves begann zu blasen und in der Reaktion des Publikums zeigte sich Bewegung. Die Bandmitglieder feuerten ihn an mit Rufen wie „Los, Paul… Hau rein, leg los!“ „Beim sechsten Chorus gab es Rufe und Händeklatschen, nach ein paar weiteren war der Lärm der Menge zu einem ununterbrochenen Tosen angewachsen, und große Teile des Publikums waren aufgestanden“., Veranstalter George Wein hatte ab einem gewissen Punkt des Konzerts die Befürchtung, die wild gewordene Menge könnte randalieren, und versuchte auf Ellington einzuwirken, die Veranstaltung zu beenden, aber „einmal an Bord des Siegeszuges, mit der Menge hinter sich, wollte Ellington nicht aufhören“, schrieb danach \\"Down Beat\\" in seinem Konzertbericht. Seine Antwort an Wein war nur „Sei nicht grob zu den Künstlern (Don’t be rude to the artists)“, Gonsalvez kam sein Solo subjektiv nicht so lang vor: „Die Länge wird wirklich vom Spiel der Rhythmusgruppe bestimmt und wie sich alles aufbaut. Der Höhepunkt mag nach fünf oder zehn Chorussen kommen, aber wenn man über ihn hinausgeht, zerstört man alles.“ Später war er verärgert, ständig an diesem Solo gemessen zu werden – das Publikum verlangte eine Wiederholung in ähnlicher Länge wie auf der Newport-Platte, was ihm immer schwerer fiel. In einem Interview behauptete er sogar, die Aufnahme selbst niemals gehört zu haben und auch niemals besessen zu haben., Als das Solo endete und Gonsalves davon völlig erschöpft war, übernahm Ellington selbst zwei Chorusse mit einem Piano-Solo, bevor dann das ganze Orchester für einen Teil von \\"Crescendo in Blue\\" zurückkehrte; es endete mit einem \\"High-note\\"-Spiel von Trompeter Cat Anderson., Um die Menge wieder etwas herunterzubringen, sagte Duke Ellington nun zwei ruhigere Stücke an, verbunden mit dem Satz: „If you’ve heard of the saxophone, then you’ve heard of Johnny Hodges.“ Ellingtons bekannter Altsaxophonist spielte dann zwei seiner bekanntesten Nummern, \\"I Got It Bad (and That Ain’t Good)\\", gefolgt von \\"Jeep’s Blues\\". Aber das Publikum verlangte mehr; so brachte Ray Nance seine speziellen Tanz- und Gesangsnummer \\"Tulip or Turnip\\", nachdem Wein Ellington noch einmal gebeten hatte, aufzuhören., Dies tat er jedoch nicht und hob zu der schnellen Nummer \\"Skin Deep\\" an, das eine Komposition des Schlagzeugers Louie Bellson war; Duke Ellington verabschiedete sich dann von seinem Publikum mit \\"Mood Indigo\\" und dankte der Menge mit „…wonderful way in which you’ve inspired us this evening“ und „You are very beautiful, very lovely and we do love you madly.“ Damit war nach neunzig Minuten das Konzert zu Ende., Das Album., Editionsgeschichte des Albums., Der Auftritt in Newport brachte Duke Ellington eine enorme Reputation und finanziellen Erfolg für den Rest seines Lebens. \\"Ellington at Newport\\" wurde zur meistverkauften Platte des Bandleaders. Das Duke Ellington Orchestra kehrte 1958 und 1959 nach Newport zurück; Columbia Records brachte den Konzertmitschnitt bald als Einfachalbum heraus., Erst im Jahr 1996 erkannte man, nachdem zuvor ein Tonbandmitschnitt des Voice of America Radioprogramms in der Library of Congress aufgetaucht war, dass Columbia das Album von 1956 sowohl mit einigen Livemitschnitten als auch mit Studio-Material (ergänzt mit künstlich erzeugtem Applaus) aus dieser Zeit vermischt hatte. Als Grund dafür wurde angegeben, dass Ellington bei der Abmischung mit der live mitgeschnittenen Version der \\"Newport Festival Suite\\" nicht zufrieden war, weil sie nicht genug geprobt worden war und der Mitschnitt nicht seinen Qualitätsstandards entsprach; so wollte er eine bessere Version der Suite (die direkt nach dem Festival aufgenommen worden war) auf dem Columbia-Album veröffentlicht sehen, was Produzent George Avakian dann auch tat., Avakian mischte dann in die Studioversion Teile der Live-Version hinein, Der Applaus wurde vom Original übernommen, um die Tatsache zu überdecken, dass Gonsalves durch die Verwendung eines falschen Mikrophons –er blies irrtümlich ins Mikrophon des Radiosenders Voice of America– oft kaum zu hören war. Bei der Neuausgabe von 1999 wurden daher die beiden Mono-Mitschnitte der \\"Voice of America\\" und der Columbia mit Hilfe digitaler Technologie neu zusammengesetzt, um eine wirklichkeitsgetreue stereophone Aufnahme dieses wohl berühmtesten Ellington-Auftritts zu erhalten. Nun ist Gonsalves’ Solo klarer zu hören, und dies auch mit dem Einsetzen der Geräusche durch das Publikum um den siebten oder achten Chorus des Solos., Während die Original-LP lediglich drei Titel enthielt, die \\"Newport Jazz Festival Suite\\", \\"Jeep’s Blues\\" und eben Gonsalves’ 14-minütiges \\"Diminuendo And Crescendo in Blue\\" bietet die neue Ausgabe zehn zusätzliche St: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Album Jazz, Album 1956, Duke-Ellington-Album, Historisches Konzert, Livealbum, Newport-Auftritt, Jazzfestival, Comeback, Aufnahmen, Auftritt"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Scorpionidae, Scorpionidae (Familie)], Opistophthalmus ist eine im südlichen Afrika und mit zwei Arten in Ostafrika verbreitete Gattung der Familie Scorpionidae innerhalb der Ordnung Skorpione. Sie ist die artenreichste und in ihrem Verbreitungsgebiet die einzige Gattung der Scorpionidae. Mit etwa 60 Arten in einem relativ begrenzten Gebiet weist sie eine große Diversität auf. Viele ihrer Arten haben nur ein sehr kleines Verbreitungsgebiet von wenigen Quadratkilometern Fläche., Fast alle Vertreter von \\"Opistophthalmus\\" leben in selbst gegrabenen Wohnröhren, die sie nur selten verlassen. Viele haben körperliche Anpassungen an die von ihnen bewohnten Lebensräume entwickelt. Dazu gehört bei felsenbewohnenden Arten, von denen einige keine Wohnröhren graben, sondern nur flache Aushöhlungen unter Steinen freilegen, ein abgeflachter Körper. Die Sandbewohner weisen an den Beinen eine dichte Behaarung auf, die ihnen das Fortschleudern von Sand beim Graben ihrer Baue erleichtert. Sehr weit gehende Anpassungen zeigen jene Arten, die ihre Wohnröhren in hartem Lehmboden graben. Sie verfügen über besonders kräftige Cheliceren (Kieferklauen), mit denen sie den harten Boden in kleinen Stücken abtragen. Ihre Augen sind, wie bei \\"Opistophthalmus glabrifrons,\\" weit nach hinten verlagert, um im Prosoma Raum für die Muskulatur der Cheliceren zu schaffen., Manche körperliche Merkmale von \\"Opistophthalmus\\" sind einzigartig unter den Skorpionen, wie die Organe zur Stridulation und zur Chemorezeption an den Cheliceren. Darüber hinaus haben manche Arten eine außergewöhnlich hohe Anzahl von Trichobothrien auf den Pedipalpen, andere eine sehr geringe Zahl von Kammzähnen an den Kammorganen., Merkmale., Die Arten der Gattung \\"Opistophthalmus\\" sind von stark unterschiedlicher Größe. Zu ihnen zählen mit dem 160 mm Länge erreichenden \\"Opistophthalmus gigas\\" einer der größten und mit dem gerade 40 mm langen \\"Opistophthalmus pygmaeus\\" der kleinste Vertreter der Familie Scorpionidae. Die Arten weisen unterschiedliche Färbungen auf, von einheitlich dunkelbraun oder schwarz bis einheitlich blassgelb. Darüber hinaus gibt es zahlreiche Arten mit dunkler Grundfarbe, bei denen Sternum, Metasoma, einzelne Tergiten, das Telson, Beine, Pedipalpen oder Chelae hell gefärbt sind. Der Sexualdimorphismus ist häufig stark ausgeprägt., Der Carapax hat bei \\"Opistophthalmus\\" am vorderen Rand nur eine flache Einbuchtung, die bei manchen Arten ganz fehlt. Bei \\"Pandinus\\" und \\"Heterometrus\\" ist diese Einbuchtung tief U-förmig eingeschnitten. Auf dem Carapax befinden sich drei seitliche (\\"laterale\\") Augenpaare, bei wenigen Arten jedoch nur zwei. Das in der Mittellinie liegende (\\"mediane\\") Augenpaar kann aus der Mitte nach vorne oder, zum Beispiel bei \\"Opistophthalmus glabrifrons\\", extrem weit nach hinten verschoben sein. Das Sternum ist länger als breit und in den meisten Fällen fünfeckig. Auf den Sterniten und an den Unterseiten der ersten vier Glieder des Metasomas befinden sich häufig ungewöhnliche Oberflächenstrukturen. Die bei den Skorpionen fast immer auf dem Metasoma vorhandenen Kiele (Carinae) sind bei \\"Opistophthalmus\\" nur schwach ausgebildet oder sie fehlen ganz. Die Zähne des Kammorgans sind kurz und gebogen, und nur bei den Männchen weniger Arten lang und gerade. Einige Arten haben eine ungewöhnlich geringe Anzahl von Zähnen an den Kammorganen, darunter in einem Fall die niedrigste bislang bei einer Skorpionart festgestellte Zahl., An den Coxen der Cheliceren haben die meisten Arten bei beiden Geschlechtern zwei Formen von Seten, die der Stridulation und der Chemorezeption dienen. Diese Organe kommen bei anderen Gattungen der Skorpione nicht vor. Die Finger der Chelae sind glatt und nur bei wenigen Arten mit Granulae besetzt. An den Coxen der Pedipalpen und des ersten Beinpaars befinden sich keine Stridulationsorgane. Einige Arten weisen eine außergewöhnlich große Zahl von Trichobothrien auf den Pedipalpen auf., Fast alle Arten der Gattung \\"Opistophthalmus\\" haben morphologische Anpassungen an die von ihnen besiedelten Lebensräume entwickelt, die ihnen Vorteile bei der Fortbewegung auf Sand oder beim Graben in hartem Boden bieten. Bei den auf Wanderdünen lebenden Arten \\"Opistophthalmus flavescens\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus holmi\\" sind diese Anpassungen extrem ausgeprägt. Die Klauen an den Tarsen sind stark vergrößert, ihre hinteren Beine haben wegen der zahlreichen Setae eine bürstenartige Erscheinung, und ihre Kammorgane sind verkleinert, mit einer stark reduzierten Anzahl der Kammzähne. Andere Arten bevorzugen felsige Lebensräume. Die männlichen Tiere von Arten wie \\"Opistophthalmus austerus\\", \\"Opistophthalmus karrooensis\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus pallipes\\" erweitern Spalten unter oder zwischen Felsen. Ihr Körperbau ist an diese Lebensweise angepasst, indem Prosoma und Mesosoma im Vergleich zu anderen Arten stark abgeflacht sind., \\"Opistophthalmus glabrifrons\\" gräbt seine Wohnröhren in hartes lehmiges Substrat. Er benutzt zum Graben nicht seine Chelae, sondern löst das Material mit seinen vergrößerten Cheliceren und befördert es mit den Hinterbeinen aus der Röhre. Dementsprechend ist die Cheliceren-Muskulatur stark entwickelt und beansprucht im vorderen Prosoma viel Raum. Dieser Umstand wurde als Erklärung für die Verschiebung des medialen Augenpaars nach hinten herangezogen. Die Beine dieser in hartem Boden grabenden Arten sind kürzer und kräftiger, mit kurzen Klauen und kräftigen Makrosetae an den Tarsen., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., \\"Opistophthalmus\\" ist im südlichen Afrika bis zum 15. Breitengrad und mit zwei Arten bis zum Kilimanjaro in Ostafrika verbreitet. Sie ist in ihrem Verbreitungsgebiet die einzige Gattung der Familie Scorpionidae. In der älteren Literatur enthaltene Fundmeldungen von Arten der Gattung \\"Pandinus\\" waren falsch. Innerhalb dieses Verbreitungsgebiets stellt die Gattung \\"Opistophthalmus\\" mit etwa 60 beschriebenen Arten mehr als 40 % der dort lebenden Skorpionarten. Damit liegt sie hier als umfangreichste taxonomische Gruppe vor der gesamten als artenreich bekannten Familie Buthidae., Die Skorpionfauna des südlichen Afrika besteht überwiegend aus Arten mit kleinem Verbreitungsgebiet. Die Gattung \\"Opistophthalmus\\" ist keine Ausnahme, fast die Hälfte ihrer Arten besiedelt Areale von weniger als 500 Quadratkilometern Fläche. Für die Verbreitung der Arten von \\"Opistophthalmus\\" wird als entscheidend betrachtet, dass sie überwiegend an Lebensräume mit einer bestimmten Bodenbeschaffenheit gebunden sind. Dabei ist die Härte des Substrats von größerer Bedeutung als seine Zusammensetzung. Einige der pelophilen (lehmliebenden oder lehmbewohnenden) Arten, \\"Opistophthalmus boehmi, Opistophthalmus carinatus\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus glabrifrons,\\" haben im Vergleich zu den psammophilen (sandbewohnenden) Verwandten sehr große Verbreitungsgebiete. Das wird damit erklärt, dass sie aufgrund ihrer erworbenen Fähigkeit zum Graben in hartem Substrat ein breiteres Spektrum an Habitaten besiedeln können., Über das Verbreitungsgebiet hinweg leben die Arten der Gattung überwiegend im trockenen westlichen Teil der Region. Nur wenige besiedeln trockene Gegenden im Osten wie die südafrikanischen Provinzen Ostkap und Limpopo. Oft sind sie an bergige und felsige Lebensräume gebunden., Innerhalb mancher Gebiete kommen verschiedene Arten der Gattung \\"Opistophthalmus\\" gemeinsam vor, die sich in der Größe der ausgewachsenen Tiere deutlich voneinander unterscheiden. Das betrifft in der Namib \\"Opistophthalmus flavescens\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus holmi,\\" sowie in der Kalahari \\"Opistophthalmus concinnus\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus wahlbergii.\\" Dieser Umstand, der auch von Arten der Gattung \\"Hadogenes\\" bekannt ist, wird damit begründet, dass so zumindest für ausgewachsene Exemplare als Prädatoren unterschiedlich großer Beutetiere eine geringere Nahrungskonkurrenz besteht. Dem wird entgegengehalten, dass es während des Heranwachsens Phasen geben muss, in denen gleich große Individuen verschiedener Arten gemeinsam vorkommen., Ein anderer Erklärungsversuch für das Auftreten nahe verwandter Arten im gleichen Gebiet führt die bevorzugte Härte des Bodens als Grund für eine verminderte Konkurrenz zwischen den betroffenen Arten an. So gräbt \\"Opistophthalmus concinnus\\" seine Höhlen in Kalkstein, und \\"Opistophthalmus wahlbergii\\" bevorzugt Lössboden. Auch die bevorzugte Lage der Baue scheint von Bedeutung zu sein. \\"Opistophthalmus granifrons\\" lebt mit \\"Opistophthalmus peringueyi\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus boehmi\\" mit \\"Opistophthalmus lawrencei\\" im gleichen Gebiet. Während die jeweils erstgenannten ihre Baue am Fuß von Inselbergen in sandigen Lehmboden graben, suchen die anderen Schutz unter Steinen., Lebensweise., Die Arten von \\"Opistophthalmus\\" werden in lithophil (steinbewohnend), pelophil (lehmbewohnend) oder psammophil (sandbewohnend) lebende unterschieden. Keine einzige Art ist ein Waldbewohner, der sich unter Baumrinde Unterschlupf sucht, und es gibt auch keine Höhlenbewohner. Die lithophilen Arten wie \\"Opistophthalmus karrooensis\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus pallipes\\" leben in Felslandschaften, einige von ihnen haben die Fähigkeit zum Bau von Wohnröhren verloren und suchen Unterschlupf unter Steinen., Die pelophilen Arten – zu ihnen gehören \\"Opistophthalmus boehmi\\" und \\"Opistophthalmus glabrifrons\\" – graben ihre Wohnröhren in Lehm oder Ton, der oft mit Sand versetzt, stark verdichtet und ausgehärtet ist. Im Unterschied zu den Sandbewohnern graben sie nicht mit den Pedipalpen, sondern mit den Cheliceren. Für mehrere Arten ist das Graben detailliert beschrieben worden. Das mit den Cheliceren gelöste Material wird mit den ersten beiden Beinpaaren nach hinten und aus der Röhre heraus geschleudert, während die beiden hinteren Beinpaare für den erforderlichen Gegenhalt sorgen. Mit den beiden Pedipalpen stützt sich der Skorpion meistens nach vorne ab, um ein Vornüberkippen zu vermeiden. Gelegentlich werden sie auch zum Fortschaufeln von Erdreich benutzt. Feuchte Erde, deren Bewegung einen höheren Kraftaufwand erfordert, wird auch dadurch bewegt, dass der Skorpion in der Röhre rückwärts läuft und das Material mit jedem Schritt ein wenig zurückschiebt. Bei der Konstruktion von Vorkammern der Baue wird auch das Metasoma zum Fortschieben von Erdreich verwendet. Dazu krümmt der Skorpion sein Metasoma zur Seite und schiebt das Material mit anschließendem Strecken fort., Zu den stark spezialisiert: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Scorpionidae, Opistophthalmus, Skorpione, Gattung, Arten, Verbreitungsgebiet, Anpassungen, Lebensröhren, Diversität, Größe"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Barockbauwerk in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Baudenkmal in Ludwigslust, Bauwerk des Hauses Mecklenburg, Bauwerk in Ludwigslust, Biografisches Museum (Herrscher und Adel), Museum im Landkreis Ludwigslust-Parchim, Parkanlage in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Schloss Ludwigslust, Schloss im Landkreis Ludwigslust-Parchim, Staatliches Museum Schwerin], Das Schloss Ludwigslust ist ein klassizistisches Ensemble aus einem Schloss mit Nebengebäuden und einem Landschaftsgarten in der gleichnamigen Stadt im südwestlichen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern., Es war von 1763 bis 1837 Hauptresidenz der (Groß-)Herzöge von Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Die großflächige Anlage mit dem Schlossgebäude als Mittelpunkt und der Hofkirche als architektonischem Gegengewicht geht auf die im Kern erhaltene und von Johann Friedrich Künnecke entworfene Anlage des Jagdschlosses Klenow mit seinen umgebenden Gartenanlagen zurück und wurde später durch den Architekten Johann Joachim Busch erweitert. Eingebunden sind Schloss und Kirche in eine planmäßig angelegte Stadt, deren Hauptstraße auf den Schlossplatz zuführt. Die Anlage bildet zusammen mit der Stadt und dem Gartenbereich ein Gesamtensemble, das in dieser Ausführung in Mecklenburg einzigartig ist. Ludwigslust wird deshalb auch oft als \\"mecklenburgisches Versailles\\" oder seltener auch als \\"Sanssouci des Nordens\\" bezeichnet., Das im Schloss untergebrachte Museum ist einer der Standorte des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin. Das Schloss ist Eigentum des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Schloss und Sammlung werden durch die Landesbehörde Staatliche Schlösser, Gärten und Kunstsammlungen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern verwaltet., Hinsichtlich seiner regionalen kulturhistorischen Bedeutung ist das Ludwigsluster Schloss mit den Residenzschlössern Güstrow, Schwerin und der einstigen Residenz Neustrelitz vergleichbar., Geschichtlicher Überblick., Ein Jagdschloss als Ursprung., Der spätere Residenzort Ludwigslust geht auf ein im 14. Jahrhundert erstmals erwähntes Gutsdorf namens \\"Klenow\\" oder auch \\"Kleinow\\" zurück, das Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm I. 1708 als Apanage seinem jüngeren Bruder Christian Ludwig II. überschrieb. Der im benachbarten Grabow residierende Prinz plante 1721 erstmals einen Jagdsitz in der wildreichen Gegend um Klenow. Nachdem das Grabower Schloss im Juni 1725 bei einem Stadtbrand zerstört worden war, schritten die Ausbaupläne für Klenow voran, scheiterten in ihrer Umsetzung jedoch vorerst an einem Streit mit dem mittlerweile regierenden Herzog Karl Leopold. Dieser war als mittlerer der drei überlebenden Brüder 1713 dem kinderlosen Friedrich WilhelmI. auf den Thron gefolgt und verlangte, den Bau des Jagdsitzes einzustellen, den er als Affront gegen sich betrachtete. Bereits begonnene Bauteile mussten auf seine Weisung wieder abgetragen werden. Karl Leopold hatte sich einige Jahre zuvor während des Großen Nordischen Krieges mit dem Kaiser überworfen, was 1728 nach weiteren Willkürakten auch in seinem Herrschaftsgebiet selbst zu seiner Amtsenthebung durch den Reichshofrat führte. Der Bau in Klenow konnte dadurch für den nunmehr eingesetzten Christian Ludwig ab 1731 fortgesetzt werden, die Baustelle stand zunächst unter dem Schutz kaiserlicher Soldaten. Als Baumeister für den neuen Jagdsitz beauftragte Herzog Christian Ludwig den vermutlich aus dem Hannoverschen stammenden Architekten Johann Friedrich Künnecke, der in jener Zeit für den Grafen Hans Caspar von Bothmer das im Nordwesten Mecklenburgs gelegene Schloss Bothmer errichtete., Der Neubau in Klenow diente vorerst nur als Jagdhaus des nach dem Grabower Brand im Neustädter Schloss residierenden Christian Ludwig, wurde aber in den folgenden Jahren umgestaltet. Ab 1748 ließ der Herzog durch den Schweriner Hofarchitekten Jean Laurent Legeay den Französischen Garten erweitern, ab 1752 erfolgte der Ausbau des Jagdhauses. Im Jahr 1754 ließ der Herzog in den \\"Mecklenburgischen Nachrichten\\" den neuen Namen des Jagdschlosses verkünden:, Die Hauptresidenz der herzoglichen Familie blieb in jenen Jahren noch in Schwerin. Nach dem Tode Christian Ludwigs im Jahr 1756 verhinderte der ausbrechende Siebenjährige Krieg vorerst weitere Baumaßnahmen in Ludwigslust., Vom Residenzschloss zum Sommersitz., Der nachfolgende Herzog Friedrich (der Fromme) verbrachte die Kriegsjahre weitgehend in Lübeck. Zwar ließ er sich bereits 1756 durch den Hofbaumeister Jean Laurent Legeay Entwürfe für eine erste Vergrößerung des Schlosses vorlegen, zur Ausführung kamen die Pläne jedoch nicht und Ludwigslust diente in dieser Zeit vor allem als Nebenresidenz seiner jüngeren Schwester Ulrike Sophie. Die einzige größere Baumaßnahme war der Große Kanal, der später eine der Hauptachsen des neuen Gartens bilden sollte., Mit dem Ende des Siebenjährigen Krieges 1763 griff Herzog Friedrich den Gedanken einer Erweiterung des Schlossbezirks wieder auf. Die ursprüngliche Idee, die bescheidene Umbauten vorsah, genügte seinen Ansprüchen zwischenzeitlich nicht mehr. Er hatte als junger Mann eine Grand Tour durch Europa gemacht und dabei auch den Hof von Versailles in Frankreich kennengelernt, der in jener Epoche für die meisten europäischen Fürstenhöfe als Vorbild diente. Für den Jagdsitz im einstigen Klenow, das ebenso wie Versailles außerhalb der eigentlichen Hauptstadt lag, wünschte der Herzog nun eine Schlossanlage nach französischem Ideal. Dort wollte er einerseits den Regierungsgeschäften nachgehen und sich andererseits seinen naturwissenschaftlichen und musischen Neigungen hingeben. Das Schloss sollte zudem den passenden Rahmen für die bereits unter seinem Vater gegründete Kunstsammlung bieten. Das Vorhaben einer zeitgemäßen Residenz wurde von seiner Ehefrau, Herzogin Louise Friderike von Württemberg, unterstützt, die als Enkelin des Württemberger Herzogs Eberhard Ludwig eine aufwendige Hofhaltung gewöhnt war, die sie am pietistisch-nüchternen Hof ihres frommen Gatten vermisste., Herzog Friedrich bat Baumeister Legeay um neue Entwürfe, zeitgleich begann der Schweriner Hofbaumeister Johann Joachim Busch mit dem Bau einer Stadtanlage nach barockem Grundriss und einer großen Hofkirche als Gegengewicht zum Schloss. Erste Bauarbeiten begannen 1763 mit den Häusern am Bassinplatz und um den späteren Kirchhof; bereits ab 1764 verlegte Herzog Friedrich den Hof von Schwerin nach Ludwigslust. 1765 wurde unter Buschs Leitung der Grundstein der Hofkirche gelegt und nach deren Vollendung 1772 der Bau des neuen Residenzschlosses begonnen, das 1777 bezogen werden konnte. Die zahlreichen gleichzeitigen Baustellen beschäftigten mehrere hundert Maurer, Zimmerleute und andere Handwerker, die Bauern der Umgebung mussten Hand- und Spanndienste leisten und Herzog Friedrich beaufsichtigte die Arbeiten regelmäßig. Die Ausgaben für das Bauprojekt konnten dadurch begrenzt werden, dass auf teure Materialien wie Marmor und edle Hölzer weitgehend verzichtet und stattdessen Pappmaché, der sogenannte Ludwigsluster Carton, eingesetzt wurde. Die Kosten trug die herzogliche Rentkammer, deren Einnahmen Erlöse aus der Forstkasse des waldreichen Gebiets aufbesserten. Als Herzog Friedrich 1785 starb, war der Schlossbezirk weitgehend vollendet. Ludwigslust hatte sich von einem Gutsdorf zu einem kleinen Fürstenhof entwickelt, der über einen Zeitraum von rund 80Jahren das kulturelle und politische Zentrum des Landesteils Mecklenburg-Schwerin bildete., \\"Mit Friedrichs Tod ging die neue Residenz des kinderlosen Herzogs an seinen Neffen und Nachfolger Friedrich Franz I. über. Dieser ließ den kaum vollendeten Barockgarten im nunmehr zeitgemäßen Stil als Englischen Landschaftsgarten erweitern und ab 1809 die Stadtanlage durch Johann Georg Barca ausbauen. Nach Friedrich Franz Tod verlegte sein ihm folgender Enkel Paul Friedrich den Hof 1837 zurück nach Schwerin, womit Ludwigslust auf den Status einer Sommerresidenz sank. Friedrich Franz II. ließ die Gartenanlage von 1852 bis 1860 durch Peter Joseph Lenné gestalterisch überarbeiten, dennoch wurde das Schloss in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts nur noch selten bewohnt. Große Teile der Ludwigsluster Kunstsammlung kamen ab 1879 nach Schwerin. Bedeutung als dauerhafter Wohnsitz erlangte das Schloss noch einmal mit dem Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs, als es im Zuge der Abdankung und der Enteignung der Mecklenburgischen Großherzöge von Friedrich Franz IV. bezogen wurde. Einige der Innenräume konnten ab 1922 erstmals von der Öffentlichkeit besichtigt werden. Die herzogliche Familie bewohnte Ludwigslust bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs, das Schlossgebäude überstand die Kriegszeit ohne bauliche Schäden. Das bei Kriegsende zunächst von westalliierten Truppen besetzte Ludwigslust entging zudem den Verwüstungen, die zahlreiche Schloss- und Herrenhausanlagen im Osten Deutschlands durch die Rote Armee widerfuhren. Dennoch gingen Teile der beweglichen Ausstattung in der Folgezeit durch Plünderung und Vernachlässigung verloren.\\", Vom Verwaltungsbau zum Schlossmuseum., In den ersten Nachkriegsjahren beherbergte das Schloss die örtliche Kommandantur der Roten Armee. Die herzogliche Familie wurde bei der Bodenreform 1947 enteignet und das Schloss schließlich vom Kreis Ludwigslust übernommen. Anfängliche Pläne, in dem Bauwerk ein Museum einzurichten, wurden nicht weiter verfolgt; die bis dahin im Schloss verbliebenen Kunstschätze gelangten teilweise nach Schwerin oder wurden im Schloss eingelagert. Die einstige herzogliche Residenz diente in der DDR-Zeit als Sitz der Kreisbehörden; in die historischen Innenräume zogen für mehrere Jahrzehnte Staatsorgane der DDR ein., Im Jahr 1986 wurden das Schloss und die Gartenanlagen unter die Verwaltung des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin gestellt und größere Maßnahmen zur Bausicherung vorgenommen, sowie erstmals wieder Räume für die Öffentlichkeit zur Besichtigung freigegeben. Das Schloss wurde zum \\"Museum für höfische Kunst und Wohnkultur\\". Die Kreisverwaltung blieb bis 1991 im Schloss, seitdem wurde es schrittweise einer musealen Nutzung zugeführt und in Abschnitten bis Ende 2015 saniert. Die Finanzierung der Restaurierung erfolgte zum Teil mit EU-Mitteln. Die Sanierung der Fassade kostete 4,8Millionen Euro, die Restaurierung der Innenräume weitere 12Millionen Euro. Die Arbeiten an der Großen Kaskade wurden 2007 begonnen und 2010 abgeschlossen; sie kosteten rund 450.000 Euro. Schloss und Park sind zu besichtigen; bis 2005 wurden im Schlossmuseum jährlich zwischen 50.000 und 60.000 Besucher gezählt. Neben vereinzelten Sonderausstellungen organisiert ein Förderverein Schlosskonzerte und ein regelmäßiges Barockfest, weiter findet alljährlich das \\"Kleine Fest im Großen Park\\" statt. Im Herbst 2017 wurden allerdings große Teile des alten Baumbestands der Gartenanlagen durch die Stürme Xavier und Herwart verwüstet; die Schließung der Lücken wird Jahrzehnte beanspruchen., Das Schloss ist eine der Außenstellen des Staatlichen Museums: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Barockbauwerk, Baudenkmal, Ludwigslust, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Museum, Biografisches, Parkanlage, Schloss, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Staatliches Museum Schwerin"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Baudenkmal in Gleichen, Bauwerk der Romanik in Niedersachsen, Christophoruskirche, Disposition einer Orgel, Gotische Wandmalerei, Kirchengebäude des Kirchenkreises Göttingen, Kirchengebäude im Landkreis Göttingen, Kirchengebäude in Europa, Klosterkirche in Deutschland, Pfarrkirche in Deutschland], Die Kirche St. Christophorus ist die evangelisch-lutherische Pfarrkirche des Dorfes Reinhausen im Landkreis Göttingen (Niedersachsen). Sie steht auf dem Sandsteinfelsen des Kirchbergs über dem Ortskern des Dorfes. Ursprung des Kirchenbaus war eine im 10. Jahrhundert errichtete Burgkapelle der Grafen von Reinhausen. Nach Umwandlung der Burg in ein Kollegiatstift diente sie diesem und seit dem 12. Jahrhundert dem daraus hervorgegangenen Benediktiner-Kloster Reinhausen als Kirche. Noch heute wird sie deshalb häufig als Klosterkirche Reinhausen bezeichnet. Gleichzeitig war sie immer Pfarrkirche des Dorfes Reinhausen. Wenige Jahrzehnte nach Einführung der Reformation im Jahr 1542 wurde das Kloster nach und nach aufgelöst, die Kirche danach mit kurzen Unterbrechungen nur noch als Gemeindekirche genutzt. Sie gehört heute zum Kirchenkreis Göttingen im Sprengel Hildesheim-Göttingen der Hannoverschen Landeskirche., Trotz erheblicher baulicher Änderungen im Stil der Gotik und des Barocks tritt im Gesamtbild der Stil der romanischen Klosterkirche deutlich hervor. Das zeigt sich besonders an dem weithin sichtbaren Westriegel mit Doppelturmanlage. Der Bautypus wurde in mehreren Bauphasen von einer romanischen Basilika zu einer Hallenkirche geändert. Im Innenraum sind mehrere spätmittelalterliche Kunstwerke erhalten, darunter zwei spätgotische Altäre, großflächige Reste von Wandmalereien sowie Steinplastiken, die unter anderem den heiligen Christophorus als Schutzpatron der Kirche darstellen., Lage., Die Klosterkirche steht auf einer Höhe von etwa auf dem Kirchberg, etwa 30Meter nördlich einer Felsenkante, die steil zum Tal des Wendebachs und zum im Tal südöstlich der Kirche gelegenen Dorfkern von Reinhausen abfällt. Durch die Lage auf einem sich nach Westen erstreckenden Ausläufer des Knülls, der steil über dem Dorf aufragt, ist die Kirche stark exponiert. Im Gegensatz zum Ortskern ist sie von den westlich angrenzenden Hügeln und selbst vom Westhang des Leinetals aus sichtbar., Die Straße, die vom Dorf auf den Kirchberg führt, wurde erst im frühen 19. Jahrhundert angelegt, zuvor war der Zugang vom Dorf zur Kirche nur zu Fuß über drei in den Felsen gehauene Treppen möglich, deren Stufen heute stark ausgetreten sind. Eine Zufahrt mit Fuhrwerken war bis dahin nur von Nordosten über den Domänenhof möglich., Die Kirche ist nicht genau geostet, sondern um einen Winkel von etwa 23Grad in Richtung Norden gedreht. Der genau genommen nach Westsüdwesten ausgerichtete Westriegel der Kirche grenzt an einen befestigten Parkplatz, an dem die heutige Zufahrtsstraße endet. Auch zu dieser Seite fällt das Gelände deutlich ab. Westlich davon stehen auf einem Ausläufer des Kirchbergs die ehemalige Schule und der Kindergarten des Ortes. Die Süd- und Ostseite der Kirche grenzen an den umfriedeten Kirchhof, während die Nordseite nicht öffentlich zugänglich ist. Sie grenzt an das ehemalige Klostergelände, das im ehemaligen Amtshaus unter anderem das Forstamt Reinhausen beherbergt und zum Kirchhof mit einer Sandsteinmauer abgegrenzt ist. Ein Zwischenbau, der die Westfront der Kirche mit dem Amtshaus verband, wurde 1955 durch einen Brand bis auf die Außenwände der beiden massiven Untergeschosse zerstört., Nordöstlich des Friedhofs liegt die Domäne Reinhausen., Geschichte., Burg der Grafen von Reinhausen., Der älteste archäologische Nachweis für menschliche Aktivitäten auf dem Reinhäuser Kirchberg ist das Bruchstück eines Steinbeils aus der Jungsteinzeit. Eine kontinuierliche Besiedlung kann allerdings erst seit dem Frühmittelalter nachgewiesen werden. Seit dem 9. Jahrhundert befand sich eine Burganlage der Grafen von Reinhausen auf dem durch Felsabbrüche zum Tal hin natürlich gesicherten Bergsporn über dem Dorf Kirchberg. Eine größere Zahl archäologischer Funde aus der Umgebung der Klosterkirche konnte auf das 9./10. Jahrhundert datiert werden. Im 10./11. Jahrhundert hatten die Grafen von Reinhausen das Gaugrafenamt im Leinegau inne und damit auch überregionale Bedeutung. Entsprechend war ihre Stammburg in Reinhausen dimensioniert: Der Wohnbereich mit Kirche im Westen umfasste etwa anderthalb Hektar Fläche, der nordöstlich angrenzende Wirtschaftshof etwa einen weiteren Hektar. Der heutige Standort der Kirche, der Kirchhof und angrenzende Gebiete waren mit eingeschlossen. Seit 1980 wurden in mehreren Einzelgrabungen und Befundaufnahmen kleinere Bereiche des Burggeländes archäologisch untersucht. An der Abbruchkante des Bergsporns wurde auf etwa neun Metern Länge eine bis zu 3,30Meter dicke zweischalige Befestigungsmauer freigelegt. Anhand hochmittelalterlicher Kleinfunde im Baubefund und im Abbruchschutt wurde der Abbruch der Mauer auf das 12. Jahrhundert datiert. Zum flach ansteigenden Hang hin bestand die Befestigung aus zwei Abschnittsgräben und einer drei Meter dicken vermörtelten Mauer. Die Innenbebauung der Burg ist schwierig zu rekonstruieren, weil das Gelände noch im Hochmittelalter durch das Kloster überbaut wurde. Im Inneren der Klosterkirche wurden bei Ausgrabungen allerdings Reste der Burgkirche der Grafen von Reinhausen gefunden. Über die genaue bauliche Gestaltung der Burgkirche liegen keine Zeugnisse vor., Stiftskirche., Ende des 11. Jahrhunderts wandelten die Grafen Konrad, Heinrich und Hermann von Reinhausen sowie ihre Schwester Mathilde ihre Stammburg in ein Stift um. Der Datierung der Umwandlung in ein Stift auf das Jahr 1079 in älterer Literatur wird jedoch in neuerer Forschung widersprochen. Stattdessen werden anhand möglicher Todesdaten eines der Stifter, des Grafen Konrad von Reinhausen, die Jahre 1089 oder 1086 als spätester Zeitpunkt der Stiftung angenommen. Nach der historischen Bauforschung durch Ulfrid Müller in den Jahren 1963–1967 gilt als sicher, dass die bauliche Substanz der Eigenkirche nach der Umwandlung der Burg in ein Kanonikerstift und später in ein Kloster für dessen Kirche Verwendung fand. Unter anderem weist darauf die Ausführung der südlichen Chorwand hin. So wird in der Anlage der Burgkirche in ottonischer Zeit bereits die Grundkonzeption der späteren Stiftskirche gesehen. Die Südwand des Chores mit einem noch erkennbaren zugesetzten Rundbogenfenster, dessen Nordwand, der Chorbogen mit den Kämpferplatten, die den unteren Bogenansatz hervorheben, und die unteren Bereiche der Pfeiler im Mittelschiff gelten als Baureste der Burgkirche. Ulfrid Müller nahm für die Ursprungskirche ein Westportal an, an dessen Stelle später die heutige Turmfront errichtet wurde. Im Vergleich zu anderen Burgkapellen in der Region ist die Kirche ungewöhnlich groß und entspricht damit der regionalen Vorrangstellung der Grafen von Reinhausen im 10. und 11. Jahrhundert., Die Klosterkirche Reinhausen geht demnach auf eine Eigenkirche in der Adelsburg der Grafen von Reinhausen zurück, die an dieser Stelle ab dem 10. Jahrhundert archäologisch nachgewiesen wurde. Entsprechend ist der Beginn der Baugeschichte der Kirche auf das 10. Jahrhundert anzusetzen. Trotz fehlender schriftlicher Zeugnisse aus der Frühzeit ist deshalb eine über tausendjährige Geschichte der Kirche nahezu sicher. In der Forschung Müllers wurde zunächst von dem Bau der Burgkirche im 11.Jahrhundert ausgegangen., Klosterkirche., Ebenso wie die vorklösterliche Geschichte ist die frühe Geschichte des Klosters Reinhausen hauptsächlich durch einen Bericht des ersten Reinhäuser Abtes Reinhard bekannt, den er zwischen 1152 und 1156 verfasst haben muss. Bei der Umwandlung vom Stift in ein Kloster handelte es sich wahrscheinlich um einen mehrere Jahrzehnte dauernden Prozess. Die Weihe der Klosterkirche wird in die Zeit zwischen 1107 und 1115 datiert und erfolgte durch Bischof Reinhard von Halberstadt. Reinhausen gehörte zum Erzbistum Mainz, insofern stand die Kirchweihe dem Mainzer Erzbischof zu. Da das Erzbistum Mainz nach dem Tod Bischof Ruthards und vor der Bischofsweihe Adalberts vakant war, war ein auswärtiger, benachbarter Bischof beauftragt worden, die Weihe vorzunehmen. Von Bischof Reinhard hatte sich Graf Hermann von Winzenburg als Initiator der Klostergründung eine großzügige Schenkung erhofft, die jedoch nicht gewährt wurde. Im \\"Niedersächsischen Klosterbuch\\" wird als wahrscheinliches Datum der Weihe der 3. Dezember 1111 angenommen. Die Angaben zur Klosterweihe beziehen sich höchstwahrscheinlich auf die Konsekration der Klosterkirche, denn die Berufung eines Abtes erfolgte frühestens im Jahr 1116., Für die erste Hälfte des 12. Jahrhunderts lässt sich das Aussehen der Klosterkirche ungefähr rekonstruieren. Ulfrid Müller und Klaus Grote gehen nach den Erkenntnissen ihrer Bauforschung davon aus, dass diese Gestalt der Burg- und Stiftskirche auch für den Ursprungsbau der Klosterkirche anzunehmen ist, dass also größere Umgestaltungen erst stattfanden, als das Kloster bereits einige Zeit bestand. Während die Kirche für eine Burgkapelle außerordentlich groß war, hatte und hat sie bis heute im Vergleich zu anderen Klosterkirchen der Romanik sehr geringe bauliche Ausmaße. In der Bausubstanz aus der ältesten Klosterzeit ist fast keine Bauornamentik nachzuweisen und die Kirche war nicht eingewölbt – anders als die Kirche des Klosters Lippoldsberg, die architektonisch Vorreiterfunktion in der Region hatte und Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts vollendet wurde. Das weist darauf hin, dass die eigentliche Errichtung der Kirche wesentlich früher erfolgte. Nach den Ergebnissen der Bauforschung entsprach auch die ursprüngliche Klosterkirche noch etwa der Burg- und Stiftskirche: Erhalten sind Teile dieser ersten Klosterkirche in der Nordwand und Südwand des Chorraums, möglicherweise im Chorbogen einschließlich der Kämpferplatten, in dem östlichen Pfeilerpaar sowie in der unteren Hälfte der beiden westlichen Pfeiler, die im Mittelschiff der heutigen Kirche stehen. Die Kirche war Rekonstruktionen zufolge eine Pfeilerbasilika mit kreuzförmigem Grundriss. Sie besaß ein Querhaus, das im Norden und Süden über die heutigen Außenwände hinausging, und ein gegenüber den Seitenschiffen erhöhtes Mittelschiff, das oberhalb der Seitenschiffe durch Obergaden belichtet war. Die dadurch architektonisch stark hervorgehobene Vierung könnte ähnlich gebaut gewesen sein wie der diesem Bauteil he: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Sie besiedelt weite Teile Europas und Asiens sowie das nördliche Nordafrika. In Europa ist sie vor allem im Siedlungsraum häufig. Aufgrund ihres charakteristischen schwarz-weißen Gefieders mit den auffallend langen Schwanzfedern ist sie auch für den vogelkundlichen Laien unverwechselbar., Elstern gehören zu den intelligentesten Vögeln, und es wird angenommen, dass sie eines der intelligentesten nichtmenschlichen Lebewesen überhaupt sind. Relativ zu ihrer Größe hat das Nidopallium caudolaterale der Elster ungefähr die gleiche Größe wie der funktional entsprechende präfrontale Cortex von Schimpansen, Gorillas, Orang-Utans und Menschen. Die Elster ist einer der wenigen bekannten Vögel, die den Spiegeltest bestehen, zusammen mit sehr wenigen anderen Nicht-Vogel-Arten., Im von der nordischen Mythologie geprägten Volksglauben galt die Elster als Bote der Todesgöttin Hel, so dass sie in Europa den Ruf des Unheilsboten bekam. Als „diebische“ Elster war sie auch im Mittelalter als Hexentier und Galgenvogel unbeliebt. Im Gegensatz dazu gilt sie in Asien traditionell als Glücksbringer und die lange Zeit als Unterart geführte nordamerikanische Hudsonelster (\\"Pica hudsonia\\") ist bei den Indianern ein Geistwesen, das mit den Menschen befreundet ist., Beschreibung., Die Grundfarben von Elstern der Nominatform sind Schwarz und Weiß. Der Schwanz ist gestuft und häufig so lang wie der gesamte Rest des Körpers, auf jeden Fall aber länger als die Flügel. Bauch, Flanken und Schultern sind weiß, auch die Handschwingen sind überwiegend weiß. Das restliche Gefieder ist schwarz mit irisierendem Glanz: Die Schwanzfedern und die Außenfahnen der Schwungfedern schimmern je nach Reflexionswinkeln – meist nur aus der Nähe erkennbar – metallisch grün, blau oder purpurfarben. Im Frühling werden die Farben matter und weniger schillernd. Auf den Außenfahnen der Handschwingen gehen sie fast ganz verloren. Am schillerndsten sind mehrere Jahre alte Vögel, insbesondere die Männchen, kurz nach der Mauser. Die männlichen und weiblichen Elstern unterscheiden sich äußerlich nicht voneinander, Männchen sind mit im Mittel 233g jedoch etwas schwerer als Weibchen (im Mittel 203g). Elstern können eine Körperlänge von etwa 46cm erreichen, die Flügelspannweite beträgt etwa 48–53cm., Junge Elstern, die einen leuchtend roten Rachen haben, sind fast ebenso gefärbt wie Altvögel, die Unterschiede sind sehr gering. Der Schwanz ist glanzlos und kürzer. Die äußeren Schulterfedern sind oft nicht reinweiß, sondern etwas grau. Die weißen Bereiche auf den Innenfahnen der äußeren Handschwingen reichen nicht so weit zur Federspitze wie bei den adulten Elstern. Die Armschwingen zeigen nur im mittleren Bereich blauen Glanz. Die äußerste Armschwinge trägt fast immer einen weißen Fleck, manchmal auch die zweite oder die dritte darauf folgende Feder., Ihre Mauser beginnen einjährige Elstern etwas früher als mehrjährige Vögel. Sie wechseln das ganze Gefieder. In Europa beginnen ein- und mehrjährige Vögel im Juni, flügge Vögel frühestens im Juli, spätestens Ende August zu mausern., Die Fortbewegung der Elster auf dem Boden erfolgt meist hüpfend. Sie ist aber auch in der Lage zu gehen. Die Elster bewegt sich sehr geschickt im Geäst von Bäumen. Sie hat einen wellenförmigen Flatterflug., Stimme., Am häufigsten lässt die Elster das „Schackern“ oder „Schäckern“ hören. Es besteht aus mehr oder weniger schnell aufeinander folgenden Rufreihen mit leicht krächzendem „schäck-schäck-schäck“. Das Schäckern ist ein Warn- und Alarmruf und dient der Verteidigung des Reviers. Nichtbrütende Elstern gebrauchen ihn nur, wenn Gefahr droht. Die Erregung der Tiere ist besonders groß, wenn das Schäckern schnell und abgehackt ist. So stellen sie sich bei langsamem Schäckern der Gefahr, fliehen aber bei schnellem Rufen., Zur Festigung der Partnerschaft lassen Paare einen leisen Plaudergesang hören. Dieser variiert zeitlich und individuell sehr stark. Er kann sowohl rhythmisch als auch arhythmisch sein. Oft sind weiche Trillerlaute und hohes Pfeifen darin enthalten. Einzelne Vögel imitieren andere Tiere. Meist besteht der Gesang jedoch aus einem gurgelnden, bauchrednerischen Schwätzen mit Pfeiflauten., Zur Reviermarkierung lassen Paare einen nach „kia“, „kjää“ oder „kik“ klingenden Ruf hören. Oft zeigen sie sich dabei in der Mitte des Reviers auf den höchsten Zweigen eines Baumes., Nestlinge betteln mit einem hohen kreischenden „twiit“. Drei bis vier Wochen alte Jungvögel melden sich bei den Altvögeln durch einen zweisilbigen Ruf. Er klingt wie „jschiejäk“, „tschjuk“ oder „tschjuk-juk“. Der Kontaktruf des Weibchens ähnelt dem Standortruf der Jungvögel., Häufig gibt die Elster auch ein lang gezogenes „tschark“ „tschirk“ „tschirrl“ oder „tschara“ von sich. Je nach Intonation (weich, hart, lang, kurz) hat dieser Ruf verschiedene Bedeutungen. Daneben kann die Elster auch nasale und gedehnte Laute wie „gräh“ hören lassen., Dass freilebende Elstern fremde Vogelarten mitunter imitieren, schließt Urs N. Glutz von Blotzheim nicht aus, ist jedoch weder die Regel, noch vollends gesichert; Glutz von Blotzheim formuliert vage: „Manche Individuen bauen auch Lautäußerungen ein, die wie Imitationen (z. B. Star, Singdrossel, Heuschreckenzirpen) klingen“., Verbreitung., Die Elster besiedelt weite Teile von Europa und Asien sowie Nordafrika. In Europa ist die Verbreitung flächendeckend und reicht vom Nordkap in Skandinavien bis zu den Südspitzen von Spanien und Griechenland. Sie fehlt nur auf einigen Mittelmeerinseln. Darüber hinaus sind im Norden Afrikas Teile der küstennahen Bereiche von Marokko, Algerien, Tunesien besiedelt. Die Elster ist ein Standvogel, in Skandinavien jedoch auch ein Strichvogel., Im Osten Europas ist die Elster bis etwa 65° N verbreitet, im Nahen Osten erstreckt sich ihr Lebensraum über die Türkei und Teile des Irans bis fast an die Küste des Persischen Golfs. In Fernost weicht die Nordgrenze der Verbreitung nach Süden bis zum Japanischen Meer bis auf etwa 50° N zurück. In Asien besiedelt die Elster Gebiete bis nach Nordvietnam. Auch der Nordwesten der Mongolei wird von Elstern besiedelt. Eine isolierte Population befindet sich auf der Kamtschatka-Halbinsel. Außerdem wird auf Nordwest-Kyushu eine kleine Population als Naturdenkmal geschützt., Systematik., Externe Systematik., Im Allgemeinen gehen Ornithologen davon aus, dass die Gattung \\"Pica\\" ihren Ursprung in der Alten Welt hat und den nordamerikanischen Kontinent im späten Pleistozän vermutlich über die Beringstraße erreichte. Da in Texas aber ein Fossil gefunden wurde, das mehr Ähnlichkeit mit \\"Pica pica\\" als mit der Gelbschnabelelster (\\"Pica nuttallii\\") hat, ist es auch möglich, dass \\"P. pica\\" im Pliozän entstanden ist., Nach neueren DNA-Untersuchungen wird die ehemals als Unterart angesehene, in Kalifornien vorkommende Gelbschnabelelster (\\"Pica nuttallii\\") als eigene Art behandelt. Die früher als Unterart angesehene, in Alaska und dem mittleren Nordamerika vorkommende Hudsonelster (\\"Pica hudsonia\\") hat sich wahrscheinlich im Pleistozän aus der in Asien vorkommenden \\"Pica pica\\" entwickelt. Andere Ornithologen vermuten jedoch, dass \\"Pica hudsonia\\" nicht aus Eurasien stammt. Neuere DNA-Analysen weisen darauf hin, dass \\"Pica hudsonia\\" ebenfalls eine eigene Art ist und mehr genetische Ähnlichkeiten mit \\"Pica nuttallii\\" aufweist als mit den eurasischen Unterarten., Interne Systematik., Die Unterarten unterscheiden sich in Größe und Gewicht, in der Größe und Zeichnung der Flügelfedern und in der Färbung der Unterrückenzone. Zudem differieren einige Teile des Skeletts und auch die Pigmentierung der Schwanzfedern, die zwischen blau, violett, kupfern, messing, purpurn und grün schwanken kann. Die dunkelsten Unterarten sind im Süden verbreitet, die hellsten im Nordosten Eurasiens. Dies betrifft besonders die Färbung des unteren Rückens. In der Regel sind die südlichen Formen größer und haben kürzere Schwanzfedern als die nordöstlichen. Es wird vermutet, dass die Aufspaltung der Art in eine gelb- und eine schwarzschnabelige Variante deutlich früher erfolgte als die Ausdifferenzierung der schwarzschnäbeligen Unterarten., DNA-Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass \\"P. p. sericea\\" große genetische Unterschiede zu den eurasischen Formen aufweist, so dass sie eine eigene Art sein könnte. Die Unterarten \\"P. p. mauretanica\\" und \\"P. p. asirensis\\" werden von einigen Forschern ebenfalls als eigene Arten betrachtet., Lebensraum., Die Elster kommt sowohl im Flachland wie im Gebirge vor. Sie ist weltweit in Höhen bis 2500m zu finden. Die Unterarten \\"P. p. asirensis\\", \\"P. p. bottanensis\\", \\"P. p. hemileucoptera\\" bilden Ausnahmen. So lebt \\"P. p. bottanensis\\" bis in 4000Meter Höhe und sucht ihre Nahrung noch bis in über 5500Meter Höhe., Die Elster besiedelt vor allem gut strukturierte, teilweise offene Landschaften mit Wiesen, Hecken, Büschen und einzelnen Baumgruppen. Sie lebt auch an Waldrändern, in der Nähe von Gewässern und in Sümpfen mit Röhricht, Weidengebüschen und Gestrüpp. Selten ist sie in schmalen Waldstreifen, kleinen Waldparzellen, ausgedehnten Wäldern und in gehölzfreien Wiesen- und Ackerlandschaften zu finden. Auch Steilhänge, schmale, tief eingeschnittene Täler sowie fels- und schneereiche Regionen werden gemieden. Nur die oben genannten Ausnahmen leben im Gebirge, teilweise auch jenseits der Schneegrenze., Mehr als die Hälfte des Bestandes in Europa brütet heute Schätzungen zufolge in und am Rand von bebauten Bereichen. Sie besiedelt insbesondere Einfamilienhausbereiche mit kurz geschnittenen Rasenflächen, daneben Parkanlagen, Alleen, Friedhöfe und große Hausgärten. Früher war sie dagegen auch in Europa ein charakteristischer Vogel der Agrarlandschaft mit Hecken und Feldgehölzen, Alleen oder alten Obstgärten., Nahrung und Nahrungserwerb., Grundsätzliches., Elstern nehmen das ganze Jahr über sowohl tierische als auch pflanzliche Nahrung auf.

Jahrhundert), Krieg (Vereinigtes Königreich)], Der Erste Opiumkrieg war ein bewaffneter Konflikt zwischen Großbritannien und dem Kaiserreich China der Qing-Dynastie, der vom 4. September 1839 bis zum 29. August 1842 ausgetragen wurde. Die britische Seite nahm die Beschlagnahmung des Opiums britischer Händler zum Anlass, den Krieg zu beginnen. Das Motiv dahinter war die Erhaltung des illegalen Opiumhandels, der für den Ausgleich des britischen Handelsdefizits mit China sorgte. Die Briten konnten das chinesische Kaiserreich in einer mehrjährigen Militärexpedition durch die Eroberung und Blockade strategisch gelegener Küstenstädte schließlich zu den ungleichen Verträgen von Nanjing und Humen zwingen. Die Konzessionen dieser Verträge entzogen China die Souveränität über den eigenen Außenhandel und öffneten die chinesischen Märkte für die Briten und andere Europäer. Ebenso musste der chinesische Staat Reparationen für die britischen Kriegskosten und das vernichtete Opium leisten., Das britische Expeditionskorps, bestehend aus einer Flotte moderner Kriegsschiffe sowie einer kleinen Landstreitmacht, besetzte dabei mehrere Städte entlang der chinesischen Küstenlinie. Die Kampfhandlungen begannen im südchinesischen Kanton und wurden durch logistische Probleme und Verhandlungen unterbrochen. Sie endeten nach der Besetzung Nanjings durch die Briten drei Jahre nach Kriegsbeginn. Während des Kriegs konnte die chinesische Seite sowohl bei der Verteidigung als auch im Angriff keine militärischen Erfolge erzielen., Die wirkungslose militärische Antwort des Qing-Staats machte die militärische Unterlegenheit Chinas für ausländische und einheimische Beobachter unübersehbar. Aufgrund des Opiumkriegs erhielten auch andere westliche Nationen ähnliche Verträge wie Großbritannien. Der verlorene Krieg gilt in China als Beginn eines Jahrhunderts kolonialer Fremdbestimmung (Jahrhundert der Demütigung) und leitete eine Legitimitätskrise des tradierten Staats- und Gesellschaftssystems ein. Er verschärfte die innenpolitischen Probleme des Landes. Im Zweiten Opiumkrieg ab 1856 gelang es Großbritannien und Frankreich erneut, durch eine militärische Machtdemonstration das durch die Taiping-Rebellion geschwächte Kaiserreich zu außen- und handelspolitischen Zugeständnissen zu zwingen., Vorgeschichte., Rolle Chinas im Welthandel., Als erste Europäer erreichten portugiesische Seefahrer dauerhafte Handelsbeziehungen mit China. Sie erhielten im 16. Jahrhundert von der Ming-Dynastie das Recht, in Macau eine Siedlung unter chinesischer Souveränität zu errichten. Der Chinahandel erwies sich in diesem Zusammenhang als nicht weniger profitabel als der Indienhandel, wobei Portugal in beiden Fällen bald niederländische und dann britische Konkurrenten abzuwehren hatte. 1637 erhielt England (ab 1707 Großbritannien) durch eine militärische Aktion vom Kaiserhof in Guangzhou \\"(Kanton)\\" das Recht auf eine Handelsniederlassung. Die Europäer mussten dort im abgeschlossenen Wohngebiet der Dreizehn Faktoreien leben und sich bei der Kommunikation mit den chinesischen Handelshäusern der Vermittlung durch Kaufleute der sog. Cohong-Gilde sowie der vom Hof bestellten Handelsbeamten („Hoppo“, chinesischer Zolldirektor in Kanton) bedienen. Die Beschränkungen, darunter Preisfestsetzungen, wurden von der Zollverwaltung festgelegt und durchgesetzt. Die Cohong-Händler, rund ein Dutzend, machten innerhalb dieses Systems große Gewinne, waren aber auch durch die Qing-Bürokratie stark reglementiert und hatten ein hohes Geschäftsrisiko zu tragen. Die Händler erlitten oft Verluste durch Schwankungen in der Nachfrage, sie hatten hohe Kontributionen an staatliche Stellen zu entrichten und mussten zudem Bestechungsgelder an die Beamten der Qing-Zollverwaltung zahlen. Das System machte sie darüber hinaus für Gesetzesverstöße der ausländischen Händler rechenschaftspflichtig., Die 1644 durch ihre militärische Überlegenheit an die Macht gekommene Mandschu-Dynastie der Qing konsolidierte das Kaiserreich und dehnte sein Territorium in Zentralasien und durch den Zugewinn Taiwans aus. Im 17. Jahrhundert war China der größte Importeur von Silber, der Grundlage für das chinesische Währungssystem. 1717 begann die East India Company mit der Aufnahme regelmäßiger Handelstätigkeit, hauptsächlich mit der Einfuhr von Tee nach England. 1760 beschränkte Kaiser Qianlong den Handel mit den Europäern ausschließlich auf Kanton. Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts galt das von der Qing-Dynastie regierte Kaiserreich China in der westlichen Welt als hochentwickelte Zivilisation. Adam Smith beschrieb das Land in seinem Werk \\"Der Wohlstand der Nationen\\" als wirtschaftliche Großmacht, die allerdings aufgrund des niedrigen Preises der Arbeit, der geringen Geldzirkulation und vieler Monopole wenig Entwicklungspotential aufweise, obwohl ihre potenzielle Leistungsfähigkeit und ihr Reichtum den Europas übertreffe. Während des 18. Jahrhunderts war die Lebenserwartung der Stadtbevölkerung in China vergleichbar mit der Europas. Gemessen am Konsum von Luxusgütern war in China der Lebensstandard der Stadtbevölkerung sogar höher. Die Einführung neuer Ackerpflanzen wie Mais und Süßkartoffeln führte zu einem schnellen Bevölkerungswachstum: Von 1740 bis 1790 verdoppelte sich die Zahl der Menschen in China. Am Ende des Jahrhunderts hatte China rund 300 bis 400 Millionen Einwohner, was etwa einem Drittel der gesamten Weltbevölkerung entsprach., Für die chinesische Seite machten die Zolleinnahmen aus dem Handel in Kanton einen wichtigen Teil der Staatseinnahmen aus. Da der Kaiser Kangxi per Erlass eine Erhöhung der Grundsteuer ausgeschlossen hatte, blieben ihm und seinen Nachfolgern nur Handelszölle als steigerungsfähige Einnahmequellen. Für die East India Company stellte der Kantonhandel die Hauptstütze ihrer Einnahmen dar. Die Teeimporte vervielfachten sich von 250.000 Pfund im Jahr 1725 auf 24 Millionen Pfund im Jahr 1805. Das einstige Luxusgut wurde zu einer Notwendigkeit des täglichen Lebens. Das britische Parlament verabschiedete 1784 ein Gesetz, welches die Ostindienkompanie verpflichtete, stets einen Einjahresvorrat als strategische Reserve vorzuhalten. Die Steuern auf dieses Importgut dienten der britischen Regierung dazu, einen Großteil der Ausgaben für die in den Napoleonischen Kriegen geforderte Royal Navy zu bestreiten. Zum Schutz der Gesellschaft erteilte ihr die Regierung 1784 ein Handelsmonopol für den Teeimport nach England., Bis etwa 1820 zeigte die bilaterale Handelsbilanz des Chinahandels immer einen deutlichen Außenhandelsüberschuss der chinesischen Wirtschaft. So flossen von 1800 bis 1810 rund 26 Millionen US-Dollar nach China. Schon 1793 bemühten sich die Briten, diesen unbefriedigenden Zustand zu beenden und China zum Abschluss eines Handelsvertrags sowie zur Öffnung seiner Häfen für englische Waren zu bewegen. Zum 83. Geburtstag des Kaisers Qianlong wurde eine Delegation entsandt, die „in sechshundert großen Kisten Geschenke im Gesamtwert von 15.600 Pfund mitbrachte“, u.a. ein Planetarium, ein Fernrohr, eine Luftpumpe und andere Metallwaren. Diese sollten für die englischen Manufakturprodukte werben. Doch der Kaiser und seine Berater hielten die Geschenke für Tributgaben, zudem für unnützes Spielzeug, und bedankten sich für die Bereitschaft König Georgs III., chinesischer Untertan zu werden., Für den Zeitraum von 1828 bis 1836 erzielte China jedoch ein Handelsdefizit von 38 Millionen US-Dollar. Diese Verluste flossen in Form von Silberwährungen ab, mit denen der Außenhandel und auch der zunehmende Opiumimport bezahlt wurden. Unabhängig vom Opiumhandel kam es durch die Unabhängigkeitsbestrebungen lateinamerikanischer Staaten zu einer Silberverknappung auf dem Weltmarkt. Durch die politische Instabilität in den Hauptförderländern Mexiko und Peru, zu dem damals die bolivianische Silbermine von Potosí gehörte, ging der weltweite Silberabbau in den 1810er-Jahren um etwa die Hälfte zurück. Diese Verknappung von Silber trieb die Importpreise in die Höhe und wirkte sich negativ auf das chinesische Währungssystem aus. Die unteren Schichten der Bauern, Handwerker und Arbeiter wurden in Kupfermünzen bezahlt, welche diese auch für Ersparnisse und Abgabenzahlungen verwendeten. Zur Abwicklung größerer Transaktionen unter Händlern und als Sparwährung der Wohlhabenden dienten Silbermünzen. Ganz überwiegend handelte es sich um mexikanische Silberpesos (entsprechend der Münze zu 8 Reales oder einem Taler zu 28 Gramm), die wegen ihrer maschinellen Prägung universell akzeptiert wurden. Daneben wurden einheimische Silberbarren genutzt, die allerdings gewogen werden mussten., Im 18. Jahrhundert blieb das System stabil bei einem Verhältnis von 1.000 Kupfermünzen zu einem Tael (rund 37g) Silber. 1820 betrug das Verhältnis 1 Silberbarren zu 1.200 Kupfermünzen. 1830 stieg es auf 1 zu 1.350. 1840 betrug es 1 : 1.600 bis 1 : 2.000. Damit verteuerten sich für die unteren Schichten sowohl Konsum- als auch Gebrauchsgüter. Ebenso verteuerten sich die Steuerzahlungen, da die Steuern in Silber berechnet, aber in Kupfer eingezogen wurden. Ab 1830 setzte eine Depression der chinesischen Wirtschaft ein und es kam zur Deflation der Getreidepreise, was die Lage für die Bevölkerungsmehrheit der Bauern weiter verschlimmerte. Trotz einer Verminderung des Gesamtsteueraufkommens stieg die effektive Steuerbelastung des durchschnittlichen bäuerlichen Haushalts in den ersten zwanzig Jahren der Herrschaft Qianlongs um 40 Prozent. Gleichzeitig wurde die Stellung der Unterschicht durch die steigende Arbeitslosigkeit bedroht. Die Währungskrise und die wirtschaftlichen Probleme brachten den Qing-Staat in Zahlungsschwierigkeiten und führten zu einer Unterfinanzierung der Streitkräfte und der öffentlichen Hand. Dies führte wiederum zu einer Zunahme der Korruption im Beamtenapparat. Die wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Misere drückte sich in immer häufigeren Unruhen, Streiks und Protesten aus., 1834 entsandte die britische Regierung Lord Napier als diplomatischen Gesandten nach China, um eine dauerhafte diplomatische Vertretung am Kaiserhof einzurichten. Dies scheiterte am Unwillen der chinesischen Behörden und führte aufgrund der Nichtbeachtung chinesischer Gesetze durch Napier zu einem kurzen Gefecht an der Perlflussmündung. Die chinesische Seite konnte Napiers Schiffe an der Weiterfahrt hindern. Napier selbst starb nach dem Rückzug aufgrund von Krankheit in Macau. Innerhalb der britischen Elite verbreitete sich nach dem Scheitern der Expedition der Gedanke, China durch militärischen Druck handelspolitisch zu öffnen.

Februar 1945. Diese forderten zwischen 22.700 und 25.000 Todesopfer, zerstörten große Teile der Innenstadt und der industriellen und militärischen Infrastruktur Dresdens. Sechsstellige Opferzahlen, die die nationalsozialistische Propaganda in Umlauf brachte, wurden durch eine umfassende historisch-empirische Untersuchung widerlegt., Die Angriffe vom Februar 1945 verstärkten die Kritik an der Luftkriegsführung der Westalliierten seit 1942 erheblich, besonders an der britischen Area Bombing Directive. Historiker diskutieren bis heute, ob diese Flächenbombardements als militärisch notwendig und zweckmäßig oder als Kriegsverbrechen zu werten sind., Das jährliche friedliche Gedenken an den 13. Februar 1945 in Dresden wird seit Ende der 1990er-Jahre regelmäßig von Rechtsextremisten für geschichtsrevisionistische Zwecke benutzt., Hintergründe und Ziele., Im Herbst und Winter 1944 rückten die Alliierten langsamer als geplant vor. Die deutsche Wehrmacht verhinderte trotz verstreuter eigener Truppen die alliierte Operation Market Garden, den Rhein zu überschreiten. Zum Jahresende folgte die deutsche Ardennenoffensive an der Westfront. Auch der Vormarsch der Roten Armee stockte seit deren Operation Bagration (Sommer 1944) bis zur Weichsel-Oder-Operation (ab Januar 1945). Auch danach hielten die Deutschen weitere zu „Festungen“ ausgebaute Städte östlich der Oder, unter anderen Breslau und Königsberg., Damals bereiteten die Alliierten den Einmarsch ihrer Bodentruppen in die „Festung Deutschland“ zur Entscheidungsschlacht gegen das NS-Regime vor. Die Westalliierten begannen ab Februar 1945 mit verstärkten Luftangriffen zur Eroberung des Ruhrgebiets und nutzten ihre seit März 1944 bestehende Luftüberlegenheit, um zahlreiche deutsche Militär-, Verkehrs-, Verwaltungs- und Regierungseinrichtungen, Produktionsstätten sowie große und kleine deutsche Städte zu bombardieren. Die Rote Armee drang bis Ende Januar 1945 auf der geografischen Breite von Berlin zur Oder vor und stand kurz davor, Schlesien zu erobern. Sie sollte erst bis März auf die für die Schlacht um Berlin notwendige Stärke anwachsen. Von Schlesien flohen Millionen Deutsche vor allem nach Mitteldeutschland. Versprengte Wehrmachteinheiten versuchten, Wiederaufstellungsräume hinter der noch ungefestigten sowjetischen Frontlinie zu erreichen., Seit Sommer 1944 plante das britische RAF Bomber Command einen besonders schweren Vernichtungsschlag (Operation Thunderclap), um den Durchhaltewillen der Deutschen endgültig zu brechen. Doch im Januar 1945 errechnete der britische Geheimdienst, dass die Wehrmacht nochmals bis zu 42 Divisionen an die Ostfront verlegen könnte. Nun wurden die Angriffspläne für die RAF und USAAF modifiziert. Dresden war bereits am 2. Februar 1945 als Ausweichziel für einen schweren Bombenangriff auf Berlin bei dortigem Schlechtwetter vorgesehen. Auf der Konferenz von Jalta vom 4. bis 11. Februar 1945 drängte der sowjetische Generaloberst Alexei Innokentjewitsch Antonow die westlichen Alliierten dazu, wichtige ostdeutsche Verkehrsknotenpunkte zu bombardieren, um weitere deutsche Truppentransporte an die Ostfront zu verhindern und so die Rote Armee von Gegenangriffen zu entlasten und ihr Vorrücken zu erleichtern. Am 7. Februar 1945 legten die alliierten Luftwaffenstäbe einvernehmlich eine östliche Ziellinie für diese Bombardierungen fest. Am 8. Februar sandte US-General Carl A. Spaatz eine neue Zielliste kommender Bombenangriffe der USAAF nach Moskau, auf der die Verkehrszentren Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden und Chemnitz in die zweithöchste Dringlichkeitsstufe nach 21 mitteldeutschen Hydrierwerken eingestuft wurden. Am 12. Februar kündigte Spaatz den USAAF-Angriff auf den Verschiebebahnhof Dresden für den Folgetag, bei Schlechtwetter für den 14. Februar, an. Der nächtliche RAF-Angriff am 13. Februar wurde den Sowjets nicht eigens angekündigt., Dresden im Krieg., Dresden hatte vor Kriegsbeginn laut Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939 genau 629.713 Einwohner und war damit die siebentgrößte deutsche Stadt. Das Stadtgebiet blieb bis zum August 1944 von Luftangriffen verschont, weil es bis dahin außerhalb der Reichweite und damit der Zielplanungen alliierter Bomber lag. Im Herbst 1944 war Dresden neben Breslau der letzte größere unbeschädigte Verkehrsknotenpunkt, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsstandort des Deutschen Reiches., Verkehr., Der Eisenbahnknoten Dresden war drittgrößter Bahnumschlagplatz des Deutschen Reichs. Hier kreuzten sich Bahnstrecken nach Berlin, Prag, Breslau, Warschau, Leipzig und Nürnberg. Da Bahnanlagen anderer Städte bereits schwer beschädigt waren, wurde der Bahnverkehr des Raums Leipzig–Berlin–Dresden ab 1944 großenteils über den Güter- und Rangierbahnhof Dresden-Friedrichstadt, den Hauptbahnhof und den Bahnhof Dresden-Neustadt abgewickelt. Zudem versorgten die Anlagen die Industriebetriebe Freitals und Bergbaubetriebe im Erzgebirge sowie die Industriegebiete von Heidenau, Pirna, Radebeul, Coswig, Bautzen und Görlitz. Die großen Industriebetriebe Dresdens waren über den Kohlebahnhof mit dem Alberthafen und dem Güterbahnhof in der Leipziger Vorstadt (Neustadt) verbunden. Dresden war Sitz der Reichsbahndirektion Dresden, die den Eisenbahnbetrieb im größten Teil Sachsens und im nordwestlichen Sudetenland organisierte. Weiterhin betrieb die Deutsche Reichsbahn in Dresden ein Ausbesserungswerk und ein Bahnbetriebswerk. Auf verkehrsarmen Strecken im Umland und in Tunneln wurden Lokomotiven und Waggons aus gefährdeteren Regionen Deutschlands abgestellt., Transporte von Truppen und Material an die Front und von Gefangenen in die Vernichtungslager wurden über Dresden abgewickelt. Aus dem Osten strömten Millionen Flüchtlinge vor allem nach Mitteldeutschland. Als Ende 1944 immer mehr Menschen aus dem Osten flohen, war Dresden, für das ein Zuzugsverbot galt, für sie Durchgangsstation., Industrie., Dresdens dicht bebaute Innenstadt bestand hauptsächlich aus Bauten der Renaissance, des Barock und Mischgebieten der Gründerzeit auf mittelalterlichem Grundriss. Damals wurden Industriebetriebe in Hinterhöfen der Wohnbebauung oder als größere Komplexe direkt neben Siedlungen errichtet., Nach den Angaben der Dresdner Industrie- und Handelskammer von 1941 war die Stadt „einer der ersten Industriestandorte des Reiches“. Bis 1944 war die Mehrzahl der Betriebe fast vollständig auf Rüstung umgestellt. Nach Angaben der USAAF waren im Februar 1945 „mindestens 110“ Fabriken und Unternehmen in Dresden ansässig, die „legitime militärische Ziele“ darstellten. 50.000 Arbeiter habe allein die Rüstungsindustrie beschäftigt. Das Hauptstaatsarchiv Dresden zeigt die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung und Produktivität des intakten Großraums: Es nennt 44 Betriebe des Geld-, Bank- und Versicherungswesens, 29 Maschinenbauwerke, 13 auf Elektrotechnik und Gerätebau spezialisierte Industriebetriebe, 12 Betriebe der Lebens- und Genussmittelindustrie, vorwiegend der Zigarettenindustrie, 6 feinmechanische und optische Industriebetriebe sowie weitere Werke, die bis dahin weitgehend auf die Kriegswirtschaft umgestellt und unzerstört waren. Als militärisch bedeutsam werden außerdem besonders nach lokalen Quellen folgende Betriebe genannt:, Das Sachsenwerk, Avus und MIAG produzierten Maschinenteile in Niedersedlitz; das Panzerwerk MIAG-Mühlenbau (ehemals Mühlenbau Gebr. Seck) befand sich im damaligen Zschachwitzer Ortsteil Sporbitz. Betriebe in Dresden-Löbtau und im südlichen Umland (Erzgebirge) stellten Handgranaten her. Die Rüstungsfabrik Universelle-Werke J. C. Müller &amp; Co. produzierte in der Südvorstadt (Zwickauer Straße, Florastraße) mit Kriegsgefangenen, die auf dem Gelände des MIAG-Mühlenbaus in Leuben und in mehreren weiteren Lagern interniert waren. Die Industrie Dresdens war mit Zwangsarbeitern aus über die gesamte Stadt verteilten Lagern versorgt. Bisher weiß man von zehn Außenstellen der Konzentrationslager Flossenbürg, Auschwitz-Birkenau und anderer in der Stadt., Seit Ende 1944 wurden nochmals weitere 5000 KZ-Häftlinge nach Dresden transportiert, darunter etwa 2000 Juden. Sie wurden bis zu den Angriffen zusammen mit Dresdner Juden in überfüllten „Judenhäusern“ untergebracht und etwa in den Rüstungsbetrieben Goehle-Werke, bei der Osram GmbH, Bernsdorf und Co. und beim Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk zur Arbeit gezwungen (siehe Vernichtung durch Arbeit)., Militär., Dresden war im Februar 1945 die letzte intakte Garnisonsstadt im Rücken der Ostfront. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts wurde die Albertstadt als Militärbezirk am nördlichen Stadtrand errichtet. Sie umfasste weitläufige Kasernenkomplexe und Versorgungseinrichtungen mit Gleisanschluss und eigenem Bahnhof, Speichern, Verladerampen, Heeresbäckerei, Metallverarbeitungs- und Handwerksbetrieben wie Sattlerei und Schneiderei. Zudem war sie mit Exerzierplätzen, Kanonenschussbahnen, einer Kirche und der Offizierschule des Heeres versorgt. Auch in Mickten sowie in Johannstadt wurden Kasernen errichtet bzw. ausgebaut., In Dresden waren ab 1921 Einheiten der Reichswehr stationiert. Nach der Machtergreifung der Nationalsozialisten wurde auch die Stadt bis 1939 nochmals militärisch ausgebaut und erhielt das Wehrbereichskommando. 1935 wurde der Fliegerhorst 38/III Dresden-Klotzsche gebaut, zwischen den damals noch nicht nach Dresden eingemeindeten Gemarkungen Klotzsche und Weixdorf (heute: Flughafen Dresden). Als erste im Deutschen Reich nahm 1936 die Luftkriegsschule Klotzsche (LKS 1) an der Hermann-Göring-Straße (heute Zur Wetterwarte) ihren Betrieb in 60 Gebäuden auf. Ab 1940 wurde der Flugplatz ausschließlich militärisch genutzt. Das Luftgaukommando IV wurde in Dresden-Strehlen am Rand der Innenstadt errichtet. Bei Nickern im Süden der Stadt entstand 1939/40 ein weiterer ausgedehnter Kasernenkomplex der Luftwaffe., Zudem standen 1939 etwa 20.000 Mann des IV. Wehrbereichs (Armeekorps) der 6. Armee in Dresden. Im Kriegsverlauf wurden die meisten regulären Truppenteile an die Front verlegt. So wurde im Dezember 1944 und Januar 1945 auch die leichte und schwere Flak aus Dresden in das Ruhrgebiet und nach Schlesien abgezogen.

Dynastie (Ägypten), Altägyptische Literatur, Archäologischer Fund (Afrika), Archäologischer Fund (Ägypten), Handschrift des Puschkin-Museums, Literarisches Werk, Reiseliteratur, Ägyptischer Papyrus], Der Reisebericht des Wenamun (auch Bericht des Wenamun, Erzählung des Wenamun, Papyrus Moskau 120) ist ein im Original titelloses Werk der altägyptischen Literatur. Der Text ist in hieratischer Schrift sowie neuägyptischer Sprache geschrieben und lediglich im Papyrus Moskau 120 überliefert, den Wladimir Semjonowitsch Golenischtschew 1891 im Antiquitätenhandel erwarb und der offenbar in der Nähe des Ortes el-Hibe gefunden wurde. Die Handlung spielt in der Übergangszeit vom Neuen Reich zur Dritten Zwischenzeit (ca. 1075 v.Chr.) und spiegelt die damalige politische Situation sehr gut wider, weshalb sie auch manchmal als historische Quelle herangezogen wurde. Der tatsächliche Zeitpunkt der Niederschrift dürfte etwa 150 Jahre später anzusetzen sein, vermutlich vor dem Palästina-Feldzug von Scheschonq I., Die Erzählung berichtet von dem Tempelbeamten Wenamun, der von Herihor, einem Hohepriester des Amun in Theben, ausgesandt wird, um in Byblos Bauholz für die Barke des Amun zu besorgen. Wenamun macht sich die Tjeker (ein Seevolk) zu Feinden und gelangt mittellos nach Byblos, wo er nicht willkommen ist. Erst ein Orakel durch einen Ekstatiker am Hof des dortigen Fürsten Tjeker-Baal gibt die Weisung, Wenamun zu empfangen. So kann er die gewünschten Hölzer doch noch besorgen. Auf der Heimfahrt begegnet er allerdings wieder den Tjekern, gerät auf der Flucht in einen Sturm und landet auf Alašija (Zypern), worauf die Erzählung abbricht., Die Erzählung zeigt die schwindende politische Macht Ägyptens im Ausland, versucht demgegenüber aber die Macht des Gottes Amun über die Landesgrenzen hinaus zu demonstrieren. Nach der jüngsten Darstellung von Bernd U. Schipper handelt es sich um ein kunstvolles Werk, das bewusst im Spannungsfeld zwischen historischem Bericht, literarischer Erzählung und religiöser und politischer Intention angesiedelt wurde., Fundumstände., Der Papyrus mit der Geschichte Wenamuns wurde von Wladimir Semjonowitsch Golenischtschew (1856 bis 1947) 1891 im Antiquitätenhandel von Kairo erworben. Seinen Angaben nach hatten Fellachen ihn kurz zuvor zusammen mit anderen Papyrusrollen in einem irdenen Gefäß in der Nähe des Ortes el-Hibe (Teuzoi) gefunden. Die gesamte Sammlung Golenischtschews ging später in den Besitz des Puschkin-Museums über. Der besagte Papyrus trägt die Inventarnummer 120 (pMoskau 120). Die beiden anderen Texte, die mit ihm gefunden wurden, sind Papyrus Moskau 127, der sogenannte Brief des Wermai, und der Papyrus Moskau 169 mit dem sogenannten „Onomastikon des Amenope“., Der Fundort el-Hibe liegt etwa 35km Luftlinie südlich von Beni Suef. Dort hat man auch andere Überreste aus der 21. Dynastie bis in die koptische Zeit gefunden. Es wurde eine Festung zur Beherrschung Oberägyptens in der 21. Dynastie angelegt, die unter Scheschonq I. und Osorkon I. mit einem Tempel für den Gott Amun ausgestattet wurde, in welchem eine lokale Form des Amun („Amun-groß-an-Gebrüll“) und die thebanische Triade verehrt wurden. Inschriftlich ist die Stadt in der sogenannten el-Hibe-Korrespondenz, der Chronik des Prinzen Osorkon und dem demotischen Papyrus Rylands IX bezeugt., Bereits Michail Alexandrowitsch Korostowzew vermutete, dass die Geschichte des Wenamun in den Archiven des Tempels von el-Hibe aufbewahrt wurde:, Geoffrey A. Wainwright deutete die Tatsache, dass der Papyrus des Wenamun in Teuzoi (el-Hibe) – und nicht in Theben – gefunden wurde, sogar so weit, dass sich „entweder die Archive in Teuzoi befanden, oder, wenn er den Bericht seiner Taten selbst behalten hatte, dass ein hoher Beamter wie Herihors offizieller Vertreter dort gelebt hatte und bestattet wurde.“, Natürlich kann nicht zwingend darauf geschlossen werden, dass der Text ursprünglich nach el-Hibe gehört und alle Verbindungen des Textes zu dieser Stadt bleiben Spekulation, auch auf Grund der Tatsache, dass die Erzählung nur auf einem Papyrus belegt ist. Trotzdem passt sie erstaunlich gut an diesen Ort. Es ist die Nebenresidenz der thebanischen Hohepriester und Station auf dem Weg nach Vorderasien., Papyrus., Da der Papyrus aus einzelnen Fragmenten besteht, war anfangs unklar, aus wie vielen Seiten er sich zusammensetzt. Wladimir Golenischtschew ging davon aus, dass der Text aus drei Seiten bestünde, wovon man das erste Viertel und die zweite Hälfte des ersten Blattes habe. Hinzu komme das gesamte zweite Blatt und der (sehr zerzauste) Beginn des dritten Blattes. Erst Adolf Erman erkannte, dass das Stück eines vermeintlichen dritten Blattes tatsächlich in die große Lücke der ersten Seite gehört. Ermans Anordnung folgten weitgehend auch Gardiner und Korostowzew in ihren Editionen des Papyrus, und ebenso der Ägyptologe Lurje und die Papyrusrestauratoren Ibscher und Alexandrovsky. Somit ergibt sich die folgende Anordnung: I, 1-27, dann Gol.III, 1–14, dann I, x+1 bis I, x+24 und II, 1-83. Da von der ersten Seite offenbar keine Zeile fehlt, schlug Alan Gardiner eine fortlaufende Nummerierung der Zeilen vor, also: I, 1-59 und II, 1-83., Wladimir Golenischtschew erwähnte außerdem ein kleines Papyrusfragment, das er von seinem Freund Heinrich Brugsch erhalten hatte und ebenfalls dieser Erzählung zuzuordnen sei. Später meinte er, dass es sich auf das zweite Blatt beziehe. Danach wird es allerdings nicht mehr erwähnt. Wo es sich befindet, ist unerforscht., Aus der Beschreibung Korostowzews und Alexandrovskys geht hervor, dass die Seiten aus einzelnen, ca. 18cm großen, mit Klebstoff verbundenen Papyrusteilen bestehen. Die Fasern des Papyrus verlaufen senkrecht zur Schreibrichtung. Auf der Rückseite der zweiten Seite, zwischen den Zeilen 1,56 und 1,48, gibt es senkrecht zu diesen zudem zwei Zeilen Text, die offenbar nichts mit der Erzählung des Wenamun gemeinsam haben., Datierung., Die Handlung der Erzählung spielt in der Übergangszeit vom Neuen Reich zur Dritten Zwischenzeit (Ende 20. Dynastie, Anfang 21. Dynastie). Antike Zeitangaben verweisen auf das Regierungsjahr eines Herrschers, und der Text selbst gibt als Handlungsbeginn den 16.SchemuIV (Monat April) im fünften Jahr an, allerdings ist der Herrscher nicht genannt. Von Anfang an war umstritten, auf welchen Herrscher sich diese Datumsangabe bezieht. Im Text werden Smendes I. und Herihor genannt, die sich zu Beginn der 21. Dynastie die Macht über Ägypten teilten, mit Sitz in Tanis und Theben. Der letzte König der 20. Dynastie, Ramses XI., wird nicht erwähnt. Adolf Erman und James H. Breasted meinten, dass sich die Jahresangabe trotzdem auf Ramses XI. beziehe, da Smendes I. und Herihor schon zu dessen Lebzeiten die Macht in Ägypten innehatten., Ramses XI. versuchte vergeblich, dem Untergang des Neuen Reiches entgegenzuwirken. In seinem 19. Regierungsjahr leitete er eine Zeit der Renaissance ein, die sogenannte \\"Wehem-mesut-Ära\\" („Erneuerung der Geburten“). Damit sollte ein bewusster Neuanfang gesetzt werden und eine Blütezeit nach einer Zeit des Verfalls beginnen. Es ist belegt, dass zu Beginn der „Wehem-mesut-Ära“ neu datiert wurde. Dementsprechend argumentierte Hermann Kees, dass das Datum der Wenamun-Erzählung auf diese Ära verweise. Dementsprechend wäre Wenamun also im 23. Regierungsjahr von Ramses XI. zu seiner Reise aufgebrochen. Viele Ägyptologen folgten dieser Ansicht., Jürgen von Beckerath machte gegen diese Sicht einige Einwände geltend:, Damit bezieht sich das Jahr fünf auf die Zeit nach Ramses XI., wobei die Frage bleibt, ob nach dem regierenden Pharao Smendes datiert wird oder nach dem thebanischen Hohepriester Herihor. Je nach Einschätzung ihrer Rolle tendiert die Forschung entweder in die eine oder andere Richtung. Unabhängig davon kann man nach den aktuellen Ansätzen der ägyptischen Chronologie davon ausgehen, dass Wenamun etwa im Jahr 1065 v.Chr. zu seiner Reise aufgebrochen ist., Die Schrift selbst wird anhand von paläografischen Untersuchungen in die 21. oder (frühe) 22. Dynastie datiert, also ca. 100–150 Jahre nach dem Zeitpunkt der Handlung. Aus inhaltlichen Gründen wird als Zeitpunkt der Niederschrift vor allem die Regierungszeit von Scheschonq I. angenommen. Ägypten verfügte unter ihm erstmals wieder über eine Zentralgewalt, und durch seinen erfolgreichen Palästina-Feldzug spielte es auch außenpolitisch wieder eine Rolle, die durch die Vorstellung von Amun-Re als König und Gott über Syrien/Palästina legitimiert wurde., In einer literaturkritischen Analyse konnte Schipper keine ältere Vorlage herausarbeiten – der Text ist literarisch einheitlich und enthält keine Brüche oder Doppelungen. Seine historische Analyse hat aber gezeigt, dass die Ereignisse durchaus einen realen Kern gehabt haben können, womit die Frage bleibt, ob es eine mündlich erzählte Vorlage gab., Inhalt., Herihor ist der Hohepriester des Gottes Amun in der Stadt Theben. Er sendet Wenamun aus, um Bauholz für die Barke des Amun zu holen. Zunächst begibt Wenamun sich nach Tanis zum Regenten Smendes I. und dessen Gemahlin Tanotamun. Nach einer mehrmonatigen Wartezeit wird er am Neujahrstag 1.AchetI (Monat Februar) des Folgejahres mit Schiff und Schiffsmannschaft ausgerüstet, damit er ins große syrische Meer ausfahren kann., Als erstes gelangt Wenamun nach Der, einer Hafenstadt der Tjeker, einem Seevolk. Dort empfängt ihn ein Stadtfürst namens Bedjer, während ein Besatzungsmitglied Wenamuns Gold und Silber stiehlt und flieht. Wenamun erbittet von Fürst Bedjer Schadensersatz. Der Fürst jedoch weist darauf hin, dass der Dieb zu Wenamuns eigener Schiffsmannschaft gehört. Er bietet Wenamun aber für einige Tage seine Gastfreundschaft an, um den Dieb suchen zu lassen. Nach neun Tagen Wartezeit beklagt sich Wenamun wegen der erfolglosen Suche erneut beim Fürsten und reist weiter. Die folgenden Zeilen sind aufgrund der starken Zerstörung des Papyrus nur schwer verständlich. Als sich Wenamun der Stadt Byblos nähert, raubt er offenbar von einem Schiff der Tjeker Silber; er will es so lange behalten, bis sein eigenes Geld wiedergefunden sei. Damit macht sich Wenamun allerdings die Tjeker zu Feinden. Auch ist unklar, was mit Wenamuns Schiff passiert ist, da in der Folge nicht mehr davon die Rede ist., Im Hafen von Byblos schlägt Wenam: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"21.

Sie umfasst eine Fläche von 41km² und befindet sich im Süden des Naturparks Niederlausitzer Heidelandschaft und an der westlichen Grenze des Schradens, eines Niederungsgebietes der Schwarzen Elster., Der Ort gehörte bis 1815 zum kursächsischen Amt Hayn und wurde nach der Teilung Sachsens gemäß den Bestimmungen des Wiener Kongresses Teil des preußischen Landkreises Liebenwerda. 1952–1993 war die Stadt Teil des Kreises Bad Liebenwerda (bis 1990 im DDR-Bezirk Cottbus). Nach der Kreisgebietsreform in Brandenburg kam Elsterwerda 1993 zum neugebildeten Landkreis Elbe-Elster., Die Stadt erfüllt seit 1995 gemeinsam mit Bad Liebenwerda die Funktion eines Mittelzentrums in Funktionsergänzung und wurde 2005 durch den Ostdeutschen Sparkassen- und Giroverband mit dem Unternehmerpreis \\"Kommune des Jahres\\" ausgezeichnet. Ihr größter Industriezweig ist die Metallindustrie mit gegenwärtig 15 Unternehmen und zirka 700 Beschäftigten. Außerdem genießt die Stadt aufgrund ihrer Bildungseinrichtungen einen guten Ruf als Schulstadt., Geografie., Geografische Lage., Elsterwerda ist eine amtsfreie Gemeinde mit Stadtrecht seit 1364. Sie liegt im Süden Brandenburgs rund 50 Kilometer nördlich von Dresden, an der westlichen Grenze des Schradens, eines 15.000 Hektar großen Niederungsgebiets im Breslau-Magdeburger Urstromtal. Außerdem gehört die Stadt zum 484km² umfassenden Gebiet des Naturparks Niederlausitzer Heidelandschaft. Das Stadtgebiet wird von der Schwarzen Elster durchflossen. Der im 18.Jahrhundert erbaute Elsterwerda-Grödel-Floßkanal stellt eine Verbindung zur Elbe her und mündet hier in die Pulsnitz, kurz bevor diese auf 88,6mü.NHN am Flusskilometer 71,09 in die Schwarze Elster eintritt., Stadtgliederung., Zum 41km² großen Stadtgebiet gehören entsprechend ihrer Hauptsatzung der Ortsteil Kraupa sowie die bewohnten Gemeindeteile Biehla, Kotschka, Krauschütz, Mitte und West. Hinzu kommen die Wohnplätze Ausbau, Reißdamm und Weinberge. Biehla und Krauschütz wurden 1940 eingemeindet, Kotschka folgte 1974, Kraupa 1993., Nachbarorte und -gemeinden., An Elsterwerda grenzt im Norden die Kurstadt Bad Liebenwerda mit ihren ausgedehnten Waldgebieten der Liebenwerdaer Heide, im Nordosten das mit Streuobstwiesen durchzogene Gebiet der Gemeinde Hohenleipisch und im Osten das vom früheren Braunkohlebergbau geprägte Plessa. Das Stadtgebiet grenzt im Süden an die Schradengemeinden Gröden und Merzdorf. Im Südwesten und Westen von Elsterwerda schließt sich das Gebiet der Gemeinde Röderland an., Geologie., Heutiges Landschaftsbild., Die Morphologie der Landschaft um Elsterwerda ist maßgeblich von der vorletzten Eiszeit geprägt. Eine mehrere hundert Meter mächtige Schicht von Sand und Kies bedeckt das kristalline Grundgebirge. Die höchsten Erhebungen der Stadt sind mit 153mü.NN die Güterbank zwischen den Ortsteilen Kraupa und Biehla und im nordöstlichen Stadtgebiet der Kalkberg, mit einer Höhe von 113mü.NN. Beide entstanden während der Saalekaltzeit und gehören zur Hohenleipisch-Plessaer Endmoräne. Gemeinsam mit der Gröden-Ortrander Endmoräne, zu der auch Brandenburgs höchste topographische Erhebung, die Heidehöhe gehört, bildet sie die Elsterwerdaer Pforte. Mit einer Ausdehnung von sieben Kilometern zwischen Elsterwerda im Norden und Merzdorf im Süden ist sie die engste Stelle des Breslau-Magdeburger Urstromtals., Kleinere Braunkohlenlagerstätten wurden von Ende des neunzehnten bis Anfang des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts auf Kraupaer Flur, wo das Flöz eine Mächtigkeit von zwei bis vier Lachter besaß, und auf Biehlaer Flur in der Grube Robert im Tief- und Tagebau abgebaut. In den Niederungsbereichen der Schwarzen Elster gibt es Vorkommen von Raseneisenstein mit einem Eisengehalt von 34 bis 50 %., Proterozoikum., Das Grundgebirgsstockwerk ist Teil der Saxothuringischen Zone des variszischen Grundgebirges. Die bei Rothstein aufgeschlossenen Kieselsinterhornsteine (Rothsteiner Felsen) sind proterozoischen Alters und bilden auch im Untergrund von Elsterwerda die ältesten Gesteinskomplexe. Es handelte sich ursprünglich um Grauwacken, welche durch unterkarbonischen Andesitvulkanismus verkieselt wurden. Die Mächtigkeit der Rothstein-Formation wird aufgrund von Forschungsbohrungen der SDAG Wismut auf etwa 1000m geschätzt, das Alter wurde mit Hilfe von Zirkonanalysen auf etwa 566 ± 10 Millionen Jahre datiert. Wahrscheinlich ist, dass es sich um Fragmente eines marinen Kontinentalrand-\\"backarc\\" der Cadomiden handelt., Klima., Der Schraden, zu dem Elsterwerda gehört, liegt im sogenannten \\"Schwarze-Elster-Bezirk\\" des Binnenlandklimas, jedoch ist ein Übergang zum Kontinentalklima spürbar. Die spezifische Ausprägung der regionalen Klimaelemente ist gering entwickelt und wird im Wesentlichen durch die Besonderheiten des nach Ost-West orientierten Reliefs des Breslau-Magdeburger Urstromtals sowie die dieses im Norden und Süden begrenzenden Höhenzüge der Endmoränen bestimmt. Dabei übt die Hohenleipisch-Plessaer Endmoräne eine gewisse Regenschattenwirkung auf die Niederungsbereiche aus. Der Schraden zählt zu den abflussärmsten Gebieten innerhalb Deutschlands., Geschichte., Frühgeschichte, Stadtgründung und Mittelalter., Die ältesten Spuren menschlicher Besiedlung in Elsterwerda wurden an der Schwarzen Elster gefunden und stammen aus der späten Bronzezeit um 1200–1100 v.Chr., Vor mehr als 1500 Jahren siedelten sich in der Umgebung der heutigen Stadt Germanen an, die wahrscheinlich zum Stamm der Semnonen gehörten. Die Spuren der relativ kurzen Besiedlung von nur einigen Jahrzehnten reichen bis in die Zeit der großen Völkerwanderung hinein. Danach blieb dieses Gebiet weitgehend siedlungsleer. Scherbenfunde im Bereich des Kalkberges sowie in der südlich vorgelagerten Niederung belegen hier erst wieder für die spätslawische Zeit Siedlungsaktivitäten., Die Burg Elsterwerda scheint im ausgehenden 12. bzw. im 13. Jahrhundert zur Sicherung des Flussübergangs, der aus Halle/Leipzig kommenden und in Richtung Ortrand führenden Niederstraße sowie einer Überlandstraße, die von Großenhain in Richtung Luckau führte, errichtet worden zu sein. Sie diente wahrscheinlich als vorgeschobener Stützpunkt der alten Burgwarte von Strehla und Boritz. Im Schutze der 1288 erstmals urkundlich erwähnten Burg entwickelte sich nördlich des Elsterübergangs im 13. Jahrhundert eine städtische Siedlung., Am 14. März 1211 wurde Elsterwerda erstmals in einer Urkunde erwähnt. Das Dokument wurde vom Bischof von Meißen ausgestellt und zeichnet eine Schenkung auf, die Heinrich von Strehla dem Kloster Altzelle machte. Von sieben Zeugen, die diese Urkunde unterzeichnet hatten, steht an vierter Stelle der Priester Rudolfus sacertos de Elsterwerden. Die westlich der Stadt zu findende Flurxadbezeichnung \\"Alte Stadt\\" und die ausgedehnte Flur lassen eine Ortsverlegung im Zuge der Stadtanlage beziehungsweise die Eingliederung benachbarter Dorfgemarkungen vermuten., Aus einer Urkunde im Hauptstaatsarchiv Weimar vom 18. Februar 1326 ist zu schließen, dass die Burg Lehnbesitz des Heinrich von Köckeritz war. Am 21. Dezember 1343 wurde ein Konrad von Köckeritz als \\"Herr von Elsterwerda\\" in einer Urkunde genannt. Dem Geschlecht von Köckeritz, das bis Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts in Elsterwerda herrschte, gelang es, im Übergangsland zwischen der Mark Meißen und der Niederlausitz ein vom Amt unabhängiges Herrschaftsgebiet aufzubauen. Zur spätmittelalterlichen Herrschaft Elsterwerda gehörten die Dörfer Krauschütz, Biehla, Kotschka, Plessa, Dreska, Kraupa, Kahla, Frauendorf, Hirschfeld, Frankenhain (vermutlich die Wüstung Franken bei Hirschfeld), Strauch, Merzdorf und ein Teil von Großthiemig. Noch 1530 rechnete man diese Dörfer zur \\"Elsterwerdaer Pflege\\". Die Köckeritze sanken allerdings später auf die Stufe von Raubrittern. Nach der Entführung des Hohenleipischer Pfarrers erschien 1509 Herzog Georg von Sachsen mit seinem Gefolge in Elsterwerda und nahm die Burg und die Stadt ein, da es Anzeichen gab, dass sich weitere Adlige dem Landfriedensbruch der Köckeritze anschließen wollten. 1512 zwang er schließlich die Köckeritze, ihren Besitz in Elsterwerda an ihn zu verkaufen und ließ die Herrschaft bis 1528 durch einen Amtmann verwalten und gliederte sie dann dem Hayner Amt an., Um 1372 wurde Elsterwerda als \\"stetichen\\" bezeichnet. Drei Tore und eine Pforte schlossen die Stadt in der Nacht von allem Verkehr ab. Da die Schwarze Elster in zahlreichen Armen und Fließen, ähnlich der Landschaft im Spreewald, um die Stadt herum floss, bot dies einen sicheren Schutz, sobald die Tore geschlossen waren; sie hatte nie eine Stadtmauer. Noch 1711 nannte das Stadtbuch das \\"Haynsche Tor\\" und das \\"Schlosstor\\" im Süden der Stadt sowie das \\"Luckische Tor\\" im Norden. Die aus dem 16. Jahrhundert stammende \\"Oedersche Karte\\" zeigt bereits die Häuserzeile, die sich gegenüber der Kirche St. Katharina befindet. Sie dürfte der älteste Teil der heutigen Stadt Elsterwerda sein. Die Kirche selbst war von einem Friedhof umgeben und an der Straße schloss sich nach Osten ein nahezu rechteckiger Stadtgrundriss an., Durch den Frieden von Tangermünde kam das Land zwischen Elbe und Elster 1312 an Brandenburg. Noch bis 1367 gehörten Burg und Stadt Elsterwerda, wo eine Pfarrkirche erstmals 1311 in einem Kopialbuch erwähnt wurde, dem Bistum Naumburg an. Um 1539 fand in Elsterwerda die erste evangelische Taufe statt, und 1547 wurde nach der Durchsetzung der Reformation Magister Petrus Ketzmann als Pfarrer in Elsterwerda eingesetzt. Außerdem wurde eine Knaben- und Mädchenschule eingerichtet. Im selben Jahr war Haubold von Maltitz (bis 1567) Herr von Elsterwerda. Ihm folgten sein Bruder Georg von Maltitz und 1586 Sigmund von Maltitz, kurfürstlich-sächsischer Stallmeister und Oberforstmeister zu Annaburg. Nach dem Tod Sigmunds erwarb die Familie von Rohr am 5.März 1612 den Besitz. Unter deren Einfluss fanden größere Bauvorhaben in Elsterwerda statt., Frühe Neuzeit., Elsterwerda wurde 1562 von einer schrecklichen Feuersbrunst fast ganz eingeäschert. In den folgenden Jahren fiel die Stadt noch viele Male dem Feuer zum Opfer. Eine Ursache dafür lag in der Bauweise der Häuser, deren Dächer mit Stroh und Schilf eingedeckt waren.

Die Sonde wurde von der NASA am 7.Juli 2003 im Rahmen des Mars-Exploration-Rover-Programm gestartet. Sein ursprünglicher Name lautete deswegen auch Mars Exploration Rover B (MER-B) und wurde dann später in Opportunity geändert., Sie landete am 25. Januar 2004 erfolgreich in einem kleinen Krater (in der Tiefebene Meridiani Planum), den die NASA später \\"Eagle Crater\\" taufte. Obwohl Opportunity nur für eine Missionsdauer von 90 sol ausgelegt war, blieb sie 5111sol bis zum 10.Juni 2018 aktiv. Ihre Mission endete nach 14Jahren und 219Tagen, als die Sonde nach einem Staubsturm nicht wieder aus dem Ruhezustand aufgeweckt werden konnte. In dieser Zeit legte Opportunity eine Strecke von 45,16km zurück. Die NASA erklärte am 13. Februar 2019, dass das Programm erfolgreich beendet wurde, nachdem alle Kommunikationsversuche mit der Sonde fehlgeschlagen seien., Die Schwestersonde Spirit (MER-A) landete am 4. Januar 2004 im Gusev-Krater und war bis zum 22.März 2010 aktiv., Ziele der Mission., Ziel der Sonde Opportunity (MER-B) und ihrer Schwestersonde Spirit (MER-A) war die Landung und geologische (eigentlich: areologische) Erkundung in Gebieten, die von den früheren Marsorbitern der NASA nach der \\"follow-the-water\\"-Strategie („folge dem Wasser“) als möglicherweise ehemals wasserführend erkannt worden waren. Sie wiesen Linienstrukturen oder Mineralien auf, die auf den Einfluss flüssigen Wassers oder vielleicht sogar auf ehemals offene Wasserflächen schließen ließen. Für Opportunity war eine Landestelle nahe dem planetaren Äquator auf der Tiefebene Meridiani Planum ausgewählt worden, weil dort ausgedehnte Vorkommen von Hämatit an der Oberfläche erkennbar waren. Hämatit kann unter anderem in offenem Wasser oder auch hydrothermal entstehen. Ein weiterer interessanter Aspekt für die Auswahl dieses Gebietes war wohl, dass ein Orbiter dort eine fast plan liegende, offenbar sehr fein geschichtete helle Gesteinsformation entdeckte, wenngleich dies vorab offiziell nie bestätigt wurde. Ob diese Gesteine allerdings äolische (windabgelagerte) oder aquatische (wasserabgelagerte) Sedimente darstellen oder ob sie Tuffite (Vulkanaschen), helle Vulkanitdecken (Lava) beziehungsweise besondere Impaktite (geschichtete Ablagerungen von sogenannten „Gesteinswolken“ aus Meteoriteneinschlägen) sind, war vor der Untersuchung am Marsboden noch völlig offen., Die Missionsdauer sollte anfangs garantierte 90Marstage betragen (90 Sol entsprechen knapp 92,5 Erd-Tagen), doch hatte Opportunity diese weit übertroffen. Die Mission wurde regelmäßig verlängert. Bei der Gesamtstrecke überschritt der Rover am 27.Juli 2014 die Marke von 40km. Damit fuhr er die weiteste jemals zurückgelegte Strecke auf einem fremden Himmelskörper. Bis Juni 2018 wurden 45,16km zurückgelegt., Technik der Sonde., Die beiden Rover Spirit und Opportunity waren baugleich. Deshalb findet sich eine genauere Beschreibung der Technik unter Mars Exploration Rover (MER)., Im Gegensatz zu Mars Pathfinder war Opportunity keine feststehende Bodenstation, sondern ein fahrbarer Roboter, „Rover“ genannt. Er war 1,6m lang, bis 1,5m hoch und 185kg schwer. Laut Spezifikation sollte er in der Lage sein, je nach Oberflächenbeschaffenheit am Tag etwa 100m, insgesamt etwa 3km zurückzulegen und bis zu sechs Monate auf der Planetenoberfläche einsatzfähig zu bleiben. Dies übertraf die Fähigkeiten des Vorgängers \\"Sojourner\\" von der Mars-Pathfinder-Mission 1997 etwa um den Faktor 60. Der Rover wurde von der NASA selbst als „Robotergeologe“ \\"(robotic geologist)\\" bezeichnet und besaß sechs unabhängig voneinander angetriebene Räder an stelzenförmigen Teleskopbeinen. Er trug neben verschiedenen Panorama- \\"(pancam),\\" Navigations- \\"(navcam)\\" und Gefahrenerkennungskameras \\"(hazcams – hazard recognition cameras)\\" einen schwenkbaren Arm mit einem Gesteinsmikroskop (ebenfalls mit Kamera), mehreren Spektrometern (Mößbauer, Alpha-Partikel, Infrarot) und einem mechanischen Werkzeug, das in der Lage war, Gesteinsoberflächen abzubürsten und auf einigen Quadratzentimetern mehrere Millimeter tief anzubohren, um auch das Innere erreichbarer Gesteine untersuchen zu können \\"(RAT – rock-abrasion-tool).\\" Die Räder wurden einzeln bewegt und dienen nicht nur zur Fortbewegung, sondern konnten auch als Schürfgeräte eingesetzt werden, um den Untergrund aufzuwühlen und damit einige Zentimeter des Bodenprofils mechanisch und fotografisch zu untersuchen. Der Rover besaß über Solarpaneele aufladbare Batterien und wurde zur Energieeinsparung nachts in einen Ruhezustand versetzt. Mit Hilfe seiner Antennen konnte das Gerät Bilder und Messergebnisse entweder an die als Zwischenstationen zur Erde verwendeten umlaufenden Orbiter der NASA und der ESA oder direkt zur Erde senden sowie Befehle von dort empfangen. Wegen der relativ langen Laufzeit der Signale von der Erde musste der Rover mit seinen Bordcomputern in gewissem Umfang autonom agieren können., Verlauf der Mission., Opportunity startete am 7.Juli 2003 erfolgreich mit einer Delta-II-7925H-Trägerrakete und landete am frühen Morgen des 25. Januar 2004 (6:05 Uhr MEZ) in der \\"Meridiani-Planum\\"-Tiefebene des Mars. Im Gegensatz zu früheren Missionen wurde der Lander nicht aus einer Umlaufbahn abgesetzt, sondern direkt aus seiner Flugbahn heraus mit einer Fehlertoleranz von wenigen Kilometern auf den Planeten niedergebracht, was äußerste Zielgenauigkeit im Anflug erforderte. Die Sonde wurde, durch einen Hitzeschild geschützt, zunächst in der Atmosphäre bis auf Schallgeschwindigkeit abgebremst. Dann entfaltete sich ein Fallschirm, an dessen Leinen ein Raketensystem oberhalb der Sonde angebracht war, das horizontale Bewegungen in der Atmosphäre ausgleichen sollte. Kurz vor dem Aufsetzen wurden schlagartig schützend das um die Sonde gelegte, von ILC Dover entwickelte, Airbaglandesystem aufgeblasen. Nach dem Aufsetzen hüpfte der Lander auf den Airbags noch etliche Male über die Oberfläche, bis er in einem kleinen Krater zum Stillstand kam. Nach Entleeren der Airbags und Öffnen der Landekapsel offenbarten die ersten Fotos des Rovers nie gesehene Strukturen am Rand des kleinen Kraters, die eines der wichtigsten Beobachtungsobjekte für Opportunity werden sollten. Sie zeigten, dass die Sonde in denkbar günstiger Position nur wenige Meter neben einem offen zutage liegenden Anschnitt der anvisierten hellen Gesteinsformation gelandet war., Erstes Halbjahr 2004 (Sol 0 bis 153) – Primärmission., Nach mehreren Tagen wurde der Rover auf seiner Landeplattform (inzwischen benannt als \\"Challenger Memorial station\\") entfaltet und konnte diese über eine heruntergeklappte Rampe verlassen. Der Boden des Kraters, der \\"Eagle\\"-Krater benannt wurde, war übersät mit kleinen Kügelchen, \\"Blueberries\\" genannt. Im Krater waren auch noch die Abdrücke der Landeairbags deutlich zu sehen. Eine Aufnahme des Infrarotspektrometers MiniTES zeigte die Hämatitverteilung innerhalb des Kraters. Dort, wo der Airbag aufgetroffen war, wurde kein Hämatit gefunden. Anscheinend wurden die Blueberries von den Airbags in den Boden gedrückt und konnten so vom MiniTES nicht gefunden werden. Eine spätere Untersuchung einer Ansammlung von Blueberries mit dem Mößbauer-Spektrometer ergab ebenfalls, dass diese Kügelchen aus Hämatit bestehen., In nur wenigen Metern Entfernung wurde am Kraterrand geschichtetes Gestein gefunden, bei der die einzelnen Lagen nur wenige Millimeter dick waren. Dies bedeutete für Geologen den Vorteil, Gestein dort zu untersuchen, wo es auch entstanden war. Die Blueberries waren teilweise in diese Gesteinsschichten eingebettet oder lagen davor verstreut. Dies deutet auf die Bildung der Blueberries innerhalb des Gesteins hin. Bei der Untersuchung des Gesteins mit dem APXS und dem Mößbauer-Spektrometer wurden Hinweise darauf gefunden, dass es Jarosit enthält. Dieses Kalium-Eisen-Sulfat-Hydroxid bildet sich meist in einer wasserreichen Umgebung. Bei einigen der Schichten konnte man geriffelte und sich überkreuzende (cross-bedding) Strukturen ausmachen, die sich üblicherweise in fließendem Wasser bilden. In einem Aufschluss namens \\"El Capitain\\" wurden schmale längliche Hohlräume gefunden. Diese Räume entstehen, wenn sich Kristalle im Gestein bilden und dann herauserodiert werden. Zudem wurde, um den Boden zu untersuchen, mit dem rechten Vorderrad ein 50cm langer und 10cm tiefer Graben gegraben; auch hier wurden die Blueberries gefunden. Zudem wurde festgestellt, dass der Boden eine sehr klumpige Struktur hat., Nach einer zweimonatigen Untersuchung verließ Opportunity den Krater. Um herauszufinden, ob die gefundenen Belege für flüssiges Wasser nur lokal oder in der ganzen Region zu finden waren, wurde als nächstes Ziel ein 750m entfernter Krater bestimmt. Dieser wurde nach dem Forschungsschiff \\"Endurance\\" benannt, das bei der Imperialen Transantarktis-Expedition unter der Leitung des britischen Polarforschers Ernest Shackleton zum Einsatz kam. Auch andere untersuchte Krater erhielten Namen berühmter Forschungsschiffe., Auf der Fahrt dorthin konnte ein Stein namens \\"Bounce Rock\\" untersucht werden. Dieser war zufälligerweise durch den Aufprall des Landeairbags getroffen worden und wurde dabei aufgebrochen. Der Stein hat eine vulkanische Natur und starke Ähnlichkeit zu den Shergottiten, einer Untergruppe der sogenannten Marsmeteoriten. Man nahm an, dass er durch einen Einschlag aus einem relativ frischen Einschlagkrater 75km südwestlich vom Eagle-Krater herausgeschleudert wurde., Der Rover konnte teilweise Strecken bis zu 100m pro Marstag zurücklegen und kam so in der flachen Ebene sehr gut voran. Unterwegs wurden an einer Stelle namens \\"Anatolia\\" Spalten oder Risse entdeckt, die entweder tektonisch entstanden sein konnten oder durch eine Serie von Einschlagkratern gebildet wurden. Auch bei einem kleineren Krater namens \\"Fram\\" konnte schwefel-, chlor- und bromreiches anstehendes Gestein entdeckt werden. Dies gab einen Hinweis darauf, dass es einmal sehr viel Oberflächenwasser gegeben haben muss, welches die gesamte Meridiani-Ebene bedeckte., Ende April 2004 erreichte Opportunity den Endurance-Krater. Um das Kraterinnere zu beobachten und eine eventuelle Einfahrstelle zu entdecken, fuhr der Rover zuerst am Kraterrand entlang. Im Innern zeigten sich die erhofften tieferen Schichtungen, der Boden selbst war durch Sanddünen bedeckt. Deshalb entschied man bei der NASA, den Rover in den Krater hineinz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Astrobiologie, Astronomische Beobachtungseinrichtung, Mars Exploration Rover Mission, Marsrover, Marssonde, NASA, Raumfahrtmission, Opportunity, Geologische Erforschung, Marsboden"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Konflikt 1941, Konflikt 1942, Konflikt 1943, Konflikt 1944, Luftkriegsoperation der Royal Air Force im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Luftkriegsoperation der United States Army Air Forces, Luftkriegsoperation im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Ploiești, Rumänien im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Rumänische Militärgeschichte], Die Luftangriffe auf Ploiești der alliierten Mächte im Zweiten Weltkrieg fanden zwischen dem 13. Juli 1941 und dem 19. August 1944 statt. Im Umland der Stadt Ploiești im Königreich Rumänien befanden sich vom Deutschen Reich kontrollierte Ölförderanlagen. Die mittels unterschiedlicher Taktiken durchgeführten Luftangriffe sollten die elf ansässigen Erdölraffinerien zerstören und damit die Produktion von kriegswichtigen Gütern wie Treibstoff verhindern oder zumindest beeinträchtigen. Diese hatten für das „Dritte Reich“ militärstrategische Bedeutung., Nach dem ersten US-Angriff am 6. Juni 1942 etablierte sich in Ploiești eine starke rumänisch-deutsche Flugabwehr; die Stadt erhielt den Beinamen Festung Ploiești. Die Operation Tidal Wave („Flutwelle“) am 1.

Erst die 1944 folgenden Flächenbombardements der United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) und der Royal Air Force (RAF) beschädigten die Ölanlagen zeitweise schwer und verringerten die Gesamtproduktionskapazität erheblich. Beide Kriegsparteien erlitten durch die Luftangriffe starke Verluste. Auch viele rumänische Zivilisten starben. Der letzte Luftangriff fand am 19. August 1944 statt., Am 23. August 1944 führte der Königliche Staatsstreich in Rumänien zur Beendigung der Militärdiktatur von Marschall Ion Antonescu und des Militärbündnisses mit dem Deutschen Reich. Tags darauf wurden die Ölanlagen von der Roten Armee eingenommen, worauf die deutsche Heeresmission in Rumänien das Land verließ., Zusammen mit den Angriffen auf Leuna und andere Hydrierwerke in Deutschland wurde 1944 die Treibstoffversorgung der Achsenmächte und insbesondere die Versorgung mit Flugbenzin entscheidend geschwächt. Als Reaktion darauf entstand 1944 der Mineralölsicherungsplan, das sogenannte \\"Geilenberg-Programm\\", womit der schwächste Punkt der deutschen Rüstungsindustrie stabilisiert werden sollte, was letztendlich misslang., Geschichte., Politische Situation., Ploiești war seit dem 19. Jahrhundert bekannt für seine Ölfelder. Unter amerikanischer Mitwirkung wurde im nahegelegenen Rîfov zwischen 1856 und 1857 die erste rumänische und weltweit dritte Ölraffinerie erbaut. Ploiești stellte für das Deutsche Reich im Zweiten Weltkrieg eine der wichtigsten Rohölquellen dar. Die Ölindustrie der Stadt entwickelte sich zu einer unter deutscher Vorherrschaft stehenden Kriegsindustrie, die hauptsächlich der Treibstoffversorgung der Wehrmacht diente., Deutsches Reich., Bereits für den Vierjahresplan von 1936 legten die Wehrmacht und das Reichsamt für Wirtschaftsausbau umfassende Denkschriften vor, in denen sie die Beschaffung von Öl als Kriegsziel beschrieben:, Der Leiter des Reichsamtes, Carl Krauch, gleichzeitig Wehrwirtschaftsführer und Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender der I.G. Farben, stellte fest, dass Rumänien und ganz Südosteuropa ein „wehrmachtmäßig zu sichernder Raum“ sei, dessen Öl ausschließlich für Deutschland „politisch und militärisch sichergestellt“ werden müsse. Er bezifferte bereits den Materialbedarf für eine Pipeline von etwa 2000 Kilometer Länge von Ploiești nach Regensburg., Adolf Hitler äußerte bei seinem Besuch im verbündeten Finnland im Juni 1942:, Der Schutz der rumänischen Ölressourcen spielte im Verlauf des Zweiten Weltkrieges eine strategisch bedeutende Rolle. Aus Sicht des Deutschen Reiches bedrohte das britische Engagement in Griechenland diese Ressourcen, da sie hierdurch in den Aktionsradius britischer Bomber gelangten. Besonders Kreta eröffnete als militärische Basis Großbritannien die Möglichkeit, den Zugang zur Ägäis zu kontrollieren und die Ölfelder in Rumänien zu bombardieren. Diese Überlegungen führten unter anderem im Verlauf des Balkanfeldzuges 1941 zur Einnahme Griechenlands und zur Luftlandeschlacht um Kreta. Die Insel verblieb bis 1945 unter deutscher Okkupation., Nach den Erinnerungen von Heinz Guderian wies Adolf Hitler am 23. August 1941 bei der Diskussion in der „Wolfsschanze“ zur Entscheidung für die Schlacht um Kiew erneut auf die Wichtigkeit der Krim hin, die „\\"als Flugzeugträger der Sowjetunion im Kampfe gegen die rumänischen Ölfelder\\"“ ausgeschaltet werden müsse. In diesem Zusammenhang äußerte Hitler: „\\"Meine Generäle verstehen nichts von Kriegswirtschaft.\\"“, Rumänien., Der ehemalige Verbündete Frankreich spielte nach dem Waffenstillstand von Compiègne (1940) vorerst keine politische und militärische Rolle mehr., Wie in den \\"Geheimen Zusatzprotokollen\\" des Deutsch-sowjetischen Nichtangriffspakts von 1939 verabredet, erfolgte die sowjetische Besetzung Bessarabiens, der (Nord-)Bukowina und des Herța-Gebietes. 1940 sah Rumänien im nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Reich trotz des Zweiten Wiener Schiedsspruchs (1940) die einzige, die dem Land beim Zusammenhalt des verbleibenden Gebietes und beim Wiedererhalt des verlorenen Gebietes helfen konnte. Der ein faschistisches Regime errichtende rumänische „Staatsführer“ Marschall Ion Antonescu umriss seine Politik mit den Worten:, Nach anfänglicher Neutralität trat Rumänien am 23. November 1940 dem Bündnis der Achsenmächte bei und stellte an der Seite des Deutschen Reiches im Juni 1941 das stärkste nicht-deutsche Truppenkontingent im mit dem Unternehmen Barbarossa begonnenen und zunächst erfolgreichen Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieg, in dessen Verlauf die an die Sowjetunion verlorenen Großrumänischen Gebiete wieder zurückerobert werden konnten. Ab Dezember 1941 befand sich Rumänien mit dem Vereinigten Königreich und ab Juni 1942 mit den Vereinigten Staaten im Kriegszustand. Militärische Erfolge wurden nun seltener; schließlich wurden Ende 1942 bedeutende Teile der rumänischen Armee in die Schlacht von Stalingrad verwickelt. Ab 1943 befanden sich die rumänischen Einheiten – wie auch die deutsche Wehrmacht – überwiegend im Rückzug, worauf Rumänien sein Engagement als Verbündeter verringerte. Bis zum November 1943 hatte das Land Verluste von etwa 250.000 Soldaten zu beklagen. Der für die Achsenmächte an der Ostfront ungünstig verlaufende Krieg führte zu Beginn des Jahres 1944 sowohl in der rumänischen Führung als auch in deren Opposition zu Überlegungen, den Bündnispartner zu wechseln., Die deutschen Verbündeten wurden von der rumänischen Bevölkerung oft als arrogant und grausam empfunden. Gegenüber der Sowjetunion bestand die Furcht vor der „Roten Gefahr“, die von der rumänischen Regierungspropaganda auch als „jüdisch-bolschewistische Plage“ bezeichnet wurde. Den ehemaligen Verbündeten aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg Frankreich und Großbritannien hingegen gehörten Sympathien, auch gingen die Zivilbevölkerung Ploieștis und das rumänische Militär mit amerikanischen Gefangenen trotz der Luftangriffe respektvoll um., Ploiești., In den Anfängen der Ölförderung im Prahova-Tal () hatte die Stadt eine starke Bevölkerungszuwanderung von Menschen aus ländlichen Gebieten. Auf industrielle Entwicklung ausgelegte Strategien transformierten die Region in eines der größten Ölförderungszentren. Die Produktion in Rumänien lag in der Zwischenkriegszeit auf dem zweiten Platz der Liste der Öl produzierenden Länder in Europa. Nur die Sowjetunion produzierte mehr. Rumänien lag mit einem Anteil von 2,2Prozent auf dem sechsten Platz der Weltrangliste. In der Gegend siedelten sich zahlreiche Raffinerien zur Weiterverarbeitung an, was im Kontrast zur Agrarwirtschaft in großen Teilen des Landes stand. Die gute Anbindung an das Straßen- und Eisenbahnnetz bescherte der Stadt eine verkehrsgünstige Lage. Die Donau ist zudem ein leistungsfähiger Wasserweg zum Schwarzen Meer., Die städtebauliche Struktur von Ploiești unterschied sich von derjenigen der meisten deutschen Städte. Die Innenstadt bestand aus zwei- beziehungsweise dreistöckigen Verwaltungsgebäuden, die übrige Stadt aus eingeschossigen und in der Regel von Gärten umgebenen kleinen Häusern. Im Gegensatz zu den oftmals wegen ihrer baulichen Struktur brandgefährdeten Innenstädten Deutschlands konnten Phosphorbomben ihr Potential mangels brennbarem Material in der hier gegebenen Architektur kaum entfalten, wohl hingegen in den Ölanlagen., Die Gesamtzahl der Einwohner der Stadt lag 1930 bei 77.341, 1941 bei etwa 90.000 und 1948 bei 96.229 Menschen, damit hatte Ploiești zeitweise das größte Bevölkerungswachstum im Land. 1940 arbeiteten fast 18.500 Menschen in der Ölindustrie, die auch oft in der deutschen Sprache unterwiesen wurden. Viele Menschen arbeiteten im Papier- und Druckbereich, im Handel, in der Landwirtschaft, im Transport und in Produktionsbetrieben. Metallverarbeitende Betriebe (zum Beispiel \\"Concordia\\") stellten auch Kriegsmaterial wie Geschütze und Munition sowie Hangars für die rumänischen Luftstreitkräfte her., Etwa fünfProzent der Bevölkerung gehörten Minderheiten an, darunter Magyaren, Rumäniendeutsche und Roma. 34Prozent der Juden der Stadt, deren Anteil an der Bevölkerung bei fünfProzent lag, waren im Handel tätig. Der übrige Teil übte freie Berufe aus oder arbeitete im Bankwesen, im medizinischen Bereich oder in der Industrie. Die Juden galten als ein wichtiges Bevölkerungssegment der Mittelschicht der Stadt. Die antisemitischen Repressalien erreichten mit dem Abtransport vieler Juden aus Ploiești wegen der „\\"Gefahr der Sabotage\\"“ ihren Höhepunkt., Das in die Industrie der Stadt investierte Kapital stammte zu 26 Prozent aus Rumänien und zu 20 Prozent von britischen, zu 16 Prozent von anglo-holländischen, zu zehn Prozent von amerikanischen, zu sechs Prozent von belgischen, zu drei Prozent zu italienischen und zu weniger als einem Prozent von deutschen und anderen Investoren., Der erfolgreiche Abschluss des Westfeldzugs gegen Frankreich versetzte das Deutsche Reich in die Lage, die Kapitalpositionen der Westmächte in der rumänischen Erdölindustrie zu beeinflussen. Am 23. Mai 1940 ließ das Reichswirtschaftsministerium die Zielgabe verlauten „\\"den in den Niederlanden und Belgien befindlichen Wertpapierbesitz sicherzustellen, um, besonders bei Holdinggesellschaften, über diesen Besitz hinweg gegebenenfalls auf die beherrschten Gesellschaften (beispielsweise in Rumänien ansässige Erdölgesellschaften) Einfluß zu gewinnen\\"“., Die Deutsche Bank führte Verhand: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Konflikt 1941, Konflikt 1942, Konflikt 1943, Konflikt 1944, Luftkriegsoperation, Royal Air Force, United States Army Air Forces, Ploiești, Rumänien, Zweiter Weltkrieg"},{"prompt":"how can i have a OpenAI API Key","completion":"To obtain an OpenAI API key, you need to follow these steps: 1.

Sie besteht aus zwei maßgeblich von Albert Einstein entwickelten physikalischen Theorien: der 1905 veröffentlichten speziellen Relativitätstheorie und der 1916 abgeschlossenen allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie. Die spezielle Relativitätstheorie beschreibt das Verhalten von Raum und Zeit aus der Sicht von Beobachtern, die sich relativ zueinander bewegen, und die damit verbundenen Phänomene. Darauf aufbauend führt die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie die Gravitation auf eine Krümmung von Raum und Zeit zurück, die unter anderem durch die beteiligten Massen verursacht wird., Der in der physikalischen Fachsprache häufige Ausdruck \\"relativistisch\\" bedeutet üblicherweise, dass eine Geschwindigkeit nicht vernachlässigbar klein gegenüber der Lichtgeschwindigkeit ist; die Grenze wird oft bei zehn Prozent gezogen. Bei relativistischen Geschwindigkeiten gewinnen die von der speziellen Relativitätstheorie beschriebenen Effekte zunehmende Bedeutung, die Abweichungen von der klassischen Mechanik können dann nicht mehr vernachlässigt werden., In diesem Artikel werden die grundlegenden Strukturen und Phänomene lediglich zusammenfassend aufgeführt. Für Erläuterungen und Details siehe die Artikel \\"Spezielle Relativitätstheorie\\" und \\"Allgemeine Relativitätstheorie\\" sowie die Verweise im Text. Zum Begriff der Relativität als solcher siehe \\"Relativität\\"., Bedeutung., Die Relativitätstheorie hat das Verständnis von Raum und Zeit revolutioniert und Zusammenhänge aufgedeckt, die sich der anschaulichen Vorstellung entziehen. Diese lassen sich jedoch mathematisch präzise in Formeln fassen und durch Experimente bestätigen. Die Relativitätstheorie enthält die newtonsche Physik als Grenzfall. Sie erfüllt damit das Korrespondenzprinzip., Das Standardmodell der Teilchenphysik beruht auf der Vereinigung der speziellen Relativitätstheorie mit der Quantentheorie zu einer relativistischen Quantenfeldtheorie., Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie ist neben der Quantenphysik eine der beiden Säulen des Theoriengebäudes Physik. Es wird allgemein angenommen, dass eine Vereinigung dieser beiden Säulen zu einer Theory of Everything (Theorie von allem) im Prinzip möglich ist. Trotz großer Anstrengungen ist solch eine Vereinigung jedoch noch nicht vollständig gelungen. Sie zählt zu den großen Herausforderungen der physikalischen Grundlagenforschung., Die spezielle Relativitätstheorie., Das Relativitätsprinzip., Die beiden folgenden Feststellungen lassen sich als Axiome der Relativitätstheorie interpretieren, aus denen alles Weitere hergeleitet werden kann:, Das Relativitätsprinzip an sich ist wenig spektakulär, denn es gilt auch für die newtonsche Mechanik. Aus ihm folgt unmittelbar, dass es keine Möglichkeit gibt, eine absolute Geschwindigkeit eines Beobachters im Raum zu ermitteln und damit ein absolut ruhendes Bezugssystem zu definieren. Ein solches Ruhesystem müsste sich in irgendeiner Form von allen anderen unterscheiden– es würde damit aber im Widerspruch zum Relativitätsprinzip stehen, wonach die Gesetze der Physik in allen Bezugssystemen dieselbe Gestalt haben. Nun beruhte vor der Entwicklung der Relativitätstheorie die Elektrodynamik auf der Annahme des Äthers als Träger elektromagnetischer Wellen. Würde ein solcher Äther als starres Gebilde den Raum füllen, dann würde er ein Bezugssystem definieren, in dem im Widerspruch zum Relativitätsprinzip die physikalischen Gesetze eine besonders einfache Form hätten und welches überdies das einzige System wäre, in dem die Lichtgeschwindigkeit konstant ist. Jedoch scheiterten alle Versuche, die Existenz des Äthers nachzuweisen, wie beispielsweise das berühmte Michelson-Morley-Experiment von 1887., Durch die Aufgabe der konventionellen Vorstellungen von Raum und Zeit und die Verwerfung der Ätherhypothese gelang es Einstein, den scheinbaren Widerspruch zwischen dem Relativitätsprinzip und der aus der Elektrodynamik folgenden Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit aufzulösen. Nicht zufällig waren es Experimente und Überlegungen zur Elektrodynamik, die zur Entdeckung der Relativitätstheorie führten. So lautete der unscheinbare Titel der einsteinschen Publikation von 1905, die die spezielle Relativitätstheorie begründete, \\"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\\"., Relativität von Raum und Zeit., Raum- und Zeitangaben sind in der Relativitätstheorie keine universell gültigen Ordnungsstrukturen. Vielmehr werden der räumliche und zeitliche Abstand zweier Ereignisse oder auch deren Gleichzeitigkeit von Beobachtern mit verschiedenen Bewegungszuständen unterschiedlich beurteilt. Bewegte Objekte erweisen sich im Vergleich zum Ruhezustand in Bewegungsrichtung als verkürzt und bewegte Uhren als verlangsamt. Da jedoch alle relativ zueinander gleichförmig bewegten Beobachter gleichermaßen den Standpunkt vertreten können, sich in Ruhe zu befinden, beruhen diese Beobachtungen auf Gegenseitigkeit, das heißt, zwei relativ zueinander bewegte Beobachter sehen die Uhren des jeweils anderen langsamer gehen. Außerdem sind aus ihrer Sicht die Meterstäbe des jeweils anderen kürzer als ein Meter, wenn sie längs der Bewegungsrichtung ausgerichtet sind. Die Frage, wer die Situation korrekter beschreibt, ist hierbei prinzipiell nicht zu beantworten und daher sinnlos., Diese Längenkontraktion und Zeitdilatation lassen sich vergleichsweise anschaulich anhand von Minkowski-Diagrammen nachvollziehen. In der mathematischen Formulierung ergeben sie sich aus der Lorentz-Transformation, die den Zusammenhang zwischen den Raum- und Zeitkoordinaten der verschiedenen Beobachter beschreibt. Diese Transformation lässt sich direkt aus den beiden obigen Axiomen und der Annahme, dass sie linear ist, herleiten., Die meisten dieser relativistisch erklärbaren Phänomene machen sich erst bei Geschwindigkeiten bemerkbar, die im Vergleich zur Lichtgeschwindigkeit nennenswert groß sind. Solche Geschwindigkeiten werden von massebehafteten Körpern im Alltag nicht annähernd erreicht., Lichtgeschwindigkeit als Grenze., Kein Objekt und keine Information kann sich schneller bewegen als das Licht im Vakuum. Nähert sich die Geschwindigkeit eines materiellen Objektes der Lichtgeschwindigkeit, so strebt der Energieaufwand für eine weitere Beschleunigung über alle Grenzen, weil die kinetische Energie mit zunehmender Annäherung an die Lichtgeschwindigkeit immer steiler ansteigt. Zum Erreichen der Lichtgeschwindigkeit müsste unendlich viel Energie aufgebracht werden., Dieser Umstand ist eine Folge der Struktur von Raum und Zeit und keine Eigenschaft des Objekts, wie beispielsweise eines lediglich unvollkommenen Raumschiffes. Würde sich ein Objekt mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit von A nach B bewegen, so gäbe es immer einen relativ zu ihm bewegten Beobachter, der eine Bewegung von B nach A wahrnehmen würde, wiederum ohne dass die Frage, wer die Situation korrekter beschreibt, einen Sinn gäbe. Das Kausalitätsprinzip wäre dann verletzt, da die Reihenfolge von Ursache und Wirkung nicht mehr definiert wäre. Ein solches Objekt würde sich übrigens für jeden Beobachter mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit bewegen., Vereinigung von Raum und Zeit zur Raumzeit., Raum und Zeit erscheinen in den Grundgleichungen der Relativitätstheorie formal fast gleichwertig nebeneinander und lassen sich daher zu einer vierdimensionalen Raumzeit vereinigen. Dass Raum und Zeit auf verschiedene Weise in Erscheinung treten, ist eine Eigenheit der menschlichen Wahrnehmung. Mathematisch lässt der Unterschied sich auf ein einziges Vorzeichen zurückführen, durch das sich die Definition eines Abstandes im euklidischen Raum von der Definition des Abstands in der vierdimensionalen Raumzeit unterscheidet. Aus gewöhnlichen Vektoren im dreidimensionalen Raum werden dabei sogenannte Vierervektoren., In der Raumzeit gibt es aufgrund der Relativität von Längen und Zeitspannen drei klar unterscheidbare Bereiche für jeden Beobachter:, Praktische Anwendung finden die Raumzeit-Vierervektoren beispielsweise in Berechnungen der Kinematik schneller Teilchen., Äquivalenz von Masse und Energie., Einem System mit der Masse \\"m\\" lässt sich auch im unbewegten Zustand eine Energie \\"E\\" zuordnen, und zwar nach, wobei \\"c\\" die Geschwindigkeit des Lichtes ist. Diese Formel ist eine der berühmtesten in der Physik. Oft wird irreführend behauptet, sie habe die Entwicklung der Atombombe ermöglicht. Die \\"Wirkungsweise\\" der Atombombe kann jedoch mit ihr nicht erklärt werden. Allerdings konnte schon 1939 kurz nach der Entdeckung der Kernspaltung mit dieser Formel und den schon bekannten Massen der Atome durch Lise Meitner die enorme Freisetzung von Energie abgeschätzt werden. Diese Massenabnahme tritt auch schon bei chemischen Reaktionen auf, war jedoch dort wegen ihrer Kleinheit mit den damaligen Messmethoden nicht bestimmbar, anders als im Fall von Kernreaktionen., Magnetfelder in der Relativitätstheorie., Die Existenz magnetischer Kräfte ist untrennbar mit der Relativitätstheorie verknüpft. Eine isolierte Existenz des coulombschen Gesetzes für elektrische Kräfte wäre nicht mit der Struktur von Raum und Zeit verträglich. So sieht ein Beobachter, der relativ zu einem System statischer elektrischer Ladungen ruht, kein Magnetfeld, anders als ein Beobachter, der sich relativ zu ihm bewegt. Übersetzt man die Beobachtungen des ruhenden Beobachters über eine Lorentz-Transformation in die des Bewegten, so stellt sich heraus, dass dieser neben der elektrischen Kraft eine weitere, magnetische Kraft wahrnimmt. Die Existenz des Magnetfeldes in diesem Beispiel lässt sich daher auf die Struktur von Raum und Zeit zurückführen. Unter diesem Gesichtspunkt wirkt auch die im Vergleich zum Coulombgesetz komplizierte und auf den ersten Blick wenig plausible Struktur des vergleichbaren biot-savartschen Gesetzes für Magnetfelder weniger verwunderlich. Im mathematischen Formalismus der Relativitätstheorie werden das elektrische und das magnetische Feld zu einer Einheit, dem vierdimensionalen elektromagnetischen Feldstärketensor, zusammengefasst, ganz analog zur Vereinigung von Raum und Zeit zur vierdimensionalen Raumzeit., Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie., Gravitation und die Krümmung der Raumzeit., Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie führt die Gravitation auf das geometrische Phänomen der gekrümmten Raumzeit zurück, indem sie feststellt:, Entzieht sich bereits die vierdimensionale Raumzeit der speziellen Relativitätstheorie einer anschaulichen Vorstellbarkeit, so g: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Albert Einstein, Relativitätstheorie, Raum, Zeit, Gravitation, spezielle Relativitätstheorie, allgemeine Relativitätstheorie, Relativität, Raumzeit, Geschwindigkeit"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Opuntia (Kakteen)], Die Opuntien (\\"Opuntia\\") sind eine Pflanzengattung aus der Familie der Kakteengewächse (Cactaceae). Mit etwa 190 Arten ist sie eine der artenreichsten Gattungen innerhalb der Kakteengewächse. Ihr Verbreitungsgebiet umfasst weite Teile Nord- und Südamerikas einschließlich der Karibik. Mit knapp der Hälfte der Arten befindet sich der Schwerpunkt der Verbreitung in Mexiko. Die aztekische Legende von der Gründung Tenochtitláns, die beschreibt, wie ein Adler auf einer Opuntie sitzt und mit einer Schlange kämpft, spiegelt sich noch heute im mexikanischen Wappen wider., Die Nutzung einiger Opuntienarten lässt sich bis in die Zeit der Paracas-Kultur zurückverfolgen. Neben der Nutzung der Triebe und Früchte als Nahrungsmittel wurden Opuntien insbesondere zur Gewinnung des Farbstoffes Cochenille-Rot kultiviert. In den letzten Jahren werden Opuntien in mehreren Ländern verstärkt als Futtermittel angebaut. Als invasive Neophyten verbreiteten sich einige Opuntienarten in verschiedenen Gebieten derart stark, dass sie mit biologischen Mitteln bekämpft werden mussten., Beschreibung., Vegetative Merkmale., Opuntien wachsen strauchig bis baumähnlich, sind aufrecht oder kriechend und bilden gelegentlich Haufen oder Matten. Sie sind häufig reich verzweigt und können Wuchshöhen von 10Metern und mehr erreichen. Einige Arten besitzen einen gut ausgebildeten, länglich runden Stamm, der zu Beginn erkennbar gegliedert ist und im Alter durchgehend erscheint. Die einzelnen Triebabschnitte, häufig Glieder genannt, sind merklich miteinander verbunden. Die grünen oder manchmal rötlich bis violetten Triebe bestehen aus abgeflachten, blattähnlichen Segmenten (Platykladien), die rund, eiförmig, elliptisch, zylindrisch oder rhomboid geformt sind. Ihre kahle oder fein behaarte Oberfläche ist nahezu glatt bis höckrig. Sie sind 2 bis 60 (selten 120) Zentimeter lang und 1,2 bis 40Zentimeter breit., Die gewöhnlich elliptischen, runden oder umgekehrt-eiförmigen Areolen in den Blattachseln (Axillen) sind 3 bis 8 (selten 10) Millimeter lang und 1 bis 7 (selten 10) Millimeter breit. Sie sind weiß, grau oder gelbbraun bis braun bewollt. Die Areolenwolle wird im Alter weiß oder grau bis schwarz. Die von den Areolen gebildeten kleinen, ungestielten, fleischigen Laubblätter sind zylindrisch bis konisch und fallen frühzeitig ab. Glochiden entspringen entweder nur am Rand einer Areole oder bilden Büschel. Sie sind anfangs weiß, gelb bis braun oder rotbraun und werden später weiß bis braun oder rotbraun. Die bis 15 (oder mehr) nadelförmigen bis pfriemlichen Dornen, die auch fehlen können, sind im Querschnitt länglich rund bis eckig-abgeflacht und werden bis 75 (selten 170) Millimeter lang. Die Dornen sind weiß, gelb bis braun, rotbraun bis grau oder schwarz gefärbt und werden mit zunehmendem Alter grau bis dunkelbraun bis schwarz. Manchmal sind sie an den Spitzen gelb oder blasser gefärbt., Blüten., Die mit wenigen Ausnahmen (beispielsweise \\"Opuntia stenopetala\\" und \\"Opuntia quimilo\\") zweigeschlechtigen und radiärsymmetrischen Blüten entspringen an den Rändern der Triebabschnitte. Sie stehen für gewöhnlich einzeln und sind von variabler Farbe. Die äußeren Tepalen sind grün bis gelb und an den Rändern mit der Farbe der inneren Tepalen getönt, die blass gelb bis orange und rosa bis rot bzw. violett gefärbt sind. Selten sind die Blüten weiß oder weisen an der Basis eine andere Farbe auf. Das Perikarpell ist kugel- bis kreiselförmig und mit Areolen sowie blattähnlichen Schuppen besetzt. Eine Blütenröhre fehlt., Die Staubblätter sind für gewöhnlich gelb oder grün und kreisförmig oder spiralförmig um den Griffel angeordnet. Sie zeigen eine ausgeprägte Thigmotaxis. Als Reaktion auf einen Berührungsreiz krümmen sie sich in Richtung des Griffels und umschließen diesen. Der Griffel ist einfach, hohl und normalerweise grün oder gelb, kann aber auch rosa, rot oder orange sein. Die breitblättrige Narbe ragt über die Staubblätter hinaus. Der einfächrige Fruchtknoten enthält mehrere hundert Samenanlagen., Früchte und Samen., Die nicht aufplatzenden, gelegentlich gestielten Früchte stehen einzeln, manchmal auch in Büscheln und sind keulenförmig bis zylindrisch, eiförmig oder verkehrt-eiförmig bis fast kugelig geformt. Sie sind 10 bis 120Millimeter lang und 8 bis 120Millimeter breit. Sie bestehen aus dem geschlossenen Hypanthium, das die Pulpe (Pericarp) und die vielen darin eingebetteten Samen enthält (Acrosarcum, Scheinfrucht)., Die Früchte weisen eine glatte oder höckrige Oberfläche auf und können, manchmal auch stark, bedornt sein und Glochiden tragen. Sie sind fleischig bis saftig oder trocken. Fleischige Früchte sind grün, gelb oder rot bis violett, trockene Früchte gelblich braun bis grau gefärbt., Die Früchte enthalten wenige bis viele, weiße bis braune Samen, die seitlich merklich abgeplattet sind. Die Samen sind kreis- bis nierenförmig. Sie sind 3 bis 10Millimeter lang. Der kleine Samenmantel ist kahl oder fein behaart., Genetik und Alter., Die Basischromosomenzahl der Gattung entspricht mit formula_1 der aller Kakteengewächse. Polyploidie ist bei den Opuntien, wie bei allen Gattungen der Unterfamilie der Opuntioideae, häufig anzutreffen., In Rattenabfallhaufen der Amerikanischen Buschratten wurden die bisher einzigen fossilen Überreste der Kakteengewächse entdeckt. Die mittels der C-14-Methode auf ein Alter von etwa 24.000Jahre datierten Reste stammen von einer zylindrischen Opuntie., Lebenszyklus., Die Samen von Opuntien, beispielsweise \\"Opuntia stricta\\", sind bis zu 15Jahre keimfähig. Für eine erfolgreiche Keimung benötigen die Samen eine Keimruhe von in der Regel mindestens einem Jahr. Um diese zu umgehen und auch die Aussaat frisch gesammelter Samen zu ermöglichen, wurden mehr oder weniger erfolgreiche Versuche unternommen, die Samen mechanisch oder mit Säuren zu behandeln. Von der Aussaat bis zur Keimung vergehen wenige Tage bis mehrere Wochen. Die Sämlinge können ein beachtliches Längenwachstum aufweisen, so wachsen Sämlinge von \\"Opuntia echios\\" im ersten Jahr bis zu 25Zentimeter. Die Sämlinge der Opuntien gehören zu Nahrung vieler Pflanzenfresser und bedürfen zum Überleben des Schutzes anderer Opuntien oder ausdauernder Pflanzen, unter denen sie heranwachsen können., Im Gegensatz zu allen anderen Gattungen der Kakteengewächse können sich aus dem Meristem einer Areole entweder Kladien oder Blüten entwickeln. Die Entwicklung einer Blütenknospe bis zum Blühen dauert zwischen 21 und 47Tagen (maximal 75Tage). Für das Heranreifen der Früchte werden zwischen 45 und 154Tage benötigt. Die längste Reifezeit wurde bei \\"Opuntia joconostle\\" beobachtet und betrug 224Tage. Die Früchte werden von Tieren gefressen, die die Samen mit ihren Ausscheidungen verbreiten., Ökologie., Bestäubung., Die Blüten der Opuntien werden von zahlreichen Hautflüglern, einigen Käfern, zwei Arten der Schmetterlinge und zehn Vogelarten aufgesucht, die jedoch nicht alle zur Bestäubung beitragen. Bei den meisten Opuntien erfolgt die Bestäubung durch Bienen, da die Blüten der Opuntien an diese Bestäuber besonders gut angepasst sind (Melittophilie). Um Pollen von den unteren Staubbeuteln zu sammeln, laufen die Bienen den Griffel entlang und nehmen dadurch die Bestäubung vor., Die Mehrheit der bestäubenden Hautflügler sind polylektisch und daher nicht auf eine Pflanzenfamilie spezialisiert. Die Gattungen \\"Ashmeadiella\\", \\"Diadasia\\", \\"Melissodes\\" und \\"Lithurge\\" sind hingegen ausschließlich auf Opuntien spezialisierte Hautflügler (oligolektisch). Von den Gattungen \\"Diadasia\\" und \\"Lithurge\\" nimmt man an, dass sie sich stammesgeschichtlich gemeinsam mit den Opuntien entwickelt haben (Koevolution)., Einige der auf den Galápagos-Inseln verbreiteten Opuntienarten werden durch die zu den Darwinfinken gehörenden Grundfinken Opuntien-Grundfink, Spitzschnabel-Grundfink und Kaktus-Grundfink (\\"Geospiza scandens\\") bestäubt. Für die Bestäubung von \\"Opuntia quimilo\\" und \\"Opuntia stenopetala\\" sind Kolibris verantwortlich., Bei den Opuntien wurde sowohl Selbstbestäubung (mit dem Pollen der eigenen Blüte) als auch Fremdbestäubung (mit dem Pollen einer anderen Blüte der gleichen Pflanze) und Xenogamie (mit dem Pollen von einer anderen Pflanze) nachgewiesen., Agamospermie., Opuntien bilden häufig Samen ohne vorherige Befruchtung aus (Agamospermie). Meistens handelt es sich dabei um aus Nucellus-Gewebe gebildete Adventivembryonen (Sporophytische Agamospermie). Bei \\"Opuntia streptacantha\\" konnte Diplosporie nachgewiesen werden, bei der sich ein Embryo aus einer unreduzierten Eizelle bildet., Ausbreitung., Opuntien sind bei ihrer Ausbreitung nicht auf bestimmte Tierarten angewiesen. Je nach Verbreitungsgebiet können dies kleine oder größere Säugetiere, Vögel, Eidechsen oder Schildkröten sein, die die Früchte der Opuntien fressen. Im südafrikanischen Kruger-Nationalpark wurden beispielsweise Paviane und Elefanten als Verbreiter von \\"Opuntia stricta\\" nachgewiesen. Die auf den Galápagos-Inseln heimischen Opuntien werden unter anderem von der Galápagos-Ratte (\\"Oryzomys bauri\\") verbreitet. Im Magen der Tiere wird die harte Samenschale durch die Verdauungssäfte angegriffen und so die Keimfähigkeit der Samen erhöht (Verdauungsausbreitung). Im mexikanischen Hochland von San Luis Potosí ist einer der Hauptverbreiter der dort beheimateten Opuntien die Ameisengattung \\"Pogonomyrmex\\" (Ameisenausbreitung)., Opuntien breiten sich nicht nur durch Samen, sondern auch durch vegetative Vermehrung aus. Die Flachsprosse vieler Opuntienarten lassen sich relativ leicht voneinander trennen.

Sein Bau erfolgte auf persönliche Anordnung des sächsischen Kurfürsten. Später diente er bis zur Einstellung der Schifffahrt im Jahre 1942 in erster Linie als Transportweg für das Gröditzer Eisenwerk. Zum Transport wurden von Bomätschern gezogene Kähne eingesetzt. Ab den 1960er Jahren bis zur Wende wurde er als Bewässerungskanal genutzt., Geografische Lage, Naturraum, Flora und Fauna., Der Elsterwerda-Grödel-Floßkanal befindet sich im östlichen Elbe-Elster-Gebiet. Beginnend an einem unmittelbar bei der Elbe gelegenen künstlich angelegten Bassin im sächsischen Grödel, verläuft der Kanal in nordöstliche Richtung durch die westliche Großenhainer Pflege bis in den Schraden zum Holzhof im brandenburgischen Elsterwerda., Zwischen Pulsen und Gröditz kreuzt der Kanal die drei Mündungsarme der Großen Röder, von denen er gespeist wird. Im Bereich der Stadt Gröditz wurde der Kanal inzwischen auf etwa einem Kilometer Länge verfüllt, wodurch er sich heute in zwei Teilstücke gliedert. Während das südliche Teilstück in Gröditz über eine Rohrleitung in die Große Röder mündet, wird der nördliche Teil über eine weitere Rohrleitung aus der Großen Röder mit Wasser versorgt. In Elsterwerda gibt es eine Verbindung in die Pulsnitz, kurz bevor diese wenig später in die Schwarze Elster fließt., Seine Breite liegt durchschnittlich bei etwa7 bis 9Metern. Die Länge beträgt 21,4Kilometer, wovon 15,45Kilometer auf sächsischen Territorium liegen. Auf der gesamten Strecke wurden sechs verbreiterte Ausweichstellen angelegt, an denen sich Lastkähne begegnen konnten. Er berührt in seinem Verlauf die Orte Glaubitz, Radewitz, Marksiedlitz, Streumen, Wülknitz, Koselitz, Tiefenau, Pulsen, Gröditz, Prösen und schließlich Elsterwerda. Dabei unterquert er unter anderem die Bahnstrecke Riesa–Dresden und die Bundesstraße 98 in Glaubitz, die Bundesstraße 169 in Prösen sowie in Elsterwerda die Bahnstrecke Berlin–Dresden., In Elsterwerda befindet sich ein kleiner Abschnitt des Floßkanals im Gebiet des 484Quadratkilometer umfassenden Naturparks Niederlausitzer Heidelandschaft, dessen Kernstück, das Naturschutzgebiet Forsthaus Prösa, einen der größten zusammenhängenden Traubeneichenwälder Mitteleuropas beherbergt. Der Kanal selbst besitzt einen reichen Fischbestand. Außerdem gibt es am Kanal Vorkommen des vom Aussterben bedrohten Elbebibers, einer seltenen Unterart des Europäischen Bibers. Des Weiteren bildet er Lebensraum und Brutgebiet verschiedener Wasservögel., An Flora sind im Wasser zahlreiche Schwimm- und Tauchpflanzen, wie unter anderem Hornblatt, Tausendblatt, Wasser- und Teichlinsen, Teichrosen und Laichkräuter zu finden. In den Uferzonen konnten bisher neben dem stellenweise sehr reichlich vorhandenen Schilf auch Busch-Nelken, Alpen-Vermeinkraut und Lungenenzian nachgewiesen werden., Name., Der Name des im Volksmund der Anliegergemeinden umgangssprachlich meist einfach nur \\"Kanal\\" genannten Gewässers war in der Vergangenheit und ist in der Gegenwart sehr variantenreich. In historischen Kartenwerken, Schriften und Dokumenten gibt es neben der Bezeichnung \\"Elsterwerda-Grödel-Floßkanal\\" eine ganze Reihe verschiedener Bezeichnungen für das Bauwerk., Während der 1997 erschienene Jubiläumsband der Heimatvereine Elsterwerda und Gröditz unter dem Namen \\"250Jahre Floßkanal Grödel-Elsterwerda\\" herausgegeben wurde, nannte man das Gewässer 1912 im Neuen Archiv für sächsische Geschichte und Altertumskunde, einer Fachzeitschrift für sächsische Landesgeschichte, wiederum \\"Floßkanal Elsterwerda – Grödel\\". In der im Jahre 1907 bei Perthes in Gotha erschienenen Karte des Deutschen Reiches und im Wiener Friedensvertrag von 1815 (Artikel 17) wird der Kanal als \\"Elsterwerdaer-Floßgraben\\" bezeichnet. Alfred Hettners \\"Geographische Zeitschrift\\" aus dem Jahre 1898 nennt ihn \\"Grödel-Elsterwerdaer Floßkanal\\". Unter diesem Namen wird er auch im 2001 erschienenen Band 63 \\"Der Schraden\\" der Publikationsreihe Werte der deutschen Heimat beschrieben. Die Flussmeisterei Riesa nennt den Kanal noch in der Gegenwart so. \\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\\" von 1885 und die 1902 erschienenen \\"Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen\\" beschrieben ihn mit \\"Grödel-Elsterwerdaer Kanal\\"., Weitere gebräuchliche Varianten waren und sind unter anderem \\"Floßkanal Grödel-Elsterwerda\\", \\"Elsterwerda-Grödeler Floßkanal\\", \\"Elbe-Elster-Floßkanal\\", \\"Elster-Elbe-Canal\\", \\"Elbe-Elster-Kanal\\" und auch \\"Floßkanal\\"., Historische Entwicklung und Nutzung des Floßkanals., Eine Residenzstadt braucht Holz., Unter dem sächsischen Kurfürsten Friedrich AugustI., auch August der Starke genannt, war im Raum Dresden/Meißen eine rege Bautätigkeit in Gang gekommen. August ließ seine Residenzstadt an der Elbe zu einer der prächtigsten Europas ausbauen. Neben der Dresdner Neustadt entstanden zahlreiche weitere Bauten und in Meißen die Porzellanmanufaktur. Des Weiteren verzeichnete die Stadt Dresden ein starkes Bevölkerungswachstum. Allein in den Jahren von 1648 bis 1699 stieg die Einwohnerzahl von 16.000 um ein Drittel auf 21.298. Bis zum Jahr 1755 sollte sie sich auf dann 63.209 Einwohnern noch einmal verdreifachen. Es gab deshalb einen stetig steigenden Bedarf an Holz. Da das Erzgebirge bereits weitgehend ausgebeutet und das böhmische Holz teuer war, besann man sich auf die riesigen Waldgebiete im Norden des Kurfürstentums. Hier lagen der südlich von Finsterwalde gelegene Grünhauser Forst, die Liebenwerdaer Heide, die Plessaer Heide und der Schradenwald. Diese befanden sich zwar zu einem Großteil in staatlichem Besitz, wurden bisher aber hauptsächlich zur Jagd genutzt und waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt deshalb weitgehend unberührt., Durch dieses Gebiet flossen als größte Gewässer die Schwarze Elster und die Pulsnitz. Zwar war die Pulsnitz durch die Anlage des neuen Pulsnitzgrabens schon seit dem 16. Jahrhundert im unteren Verlauf zu Meliorationszwecken weitgehend begradigt worden, die Schwarze Elster aber floss in zahlreichen kleinen kurvenreichen Nebenarmen durch die Niederung. Ein geregelter Flößereibetrieb war hier deshalb erst unterhalb der Stadt Liebenwerda möglich, was es wiederum notwendig machte, das Holz mit insgesamt hohem Aufwand erst bis zur Elstermündung bei Jessen zu flößen und anschließend wieder die Elbe stromaufwärts zu transportieren., Am besten geeignet, den begehrten Rohstoff auf kürzestem Weg in die Residenzstadt zu bringen, schien eine noch anzulegende Verbindung zwischen der Schwarzen Elster und der Elbe. Erste Planungen für das Projekt, die beiden Flüsse zu verbinden, wurden auf den persönlichen Befehl des Kurfürsten hin bereits im Jahre 1702 unternommen. Jedoch sollten die Vorplanungen und Untersuchungen noch mehrere Jahrzehnte in Anspruch nehmen., Nach ersten Bauprüfungen eines Floßgrabens wurde einige Zeit später der sogenannte Hauptfloßgraben mit einer Länge von 26 Kilometern realisiert. Der Hauptfloßgraben wurde von drei Zuflüssen gespeist. Sie begannen in den südlich von Finsterwalde gelegenen Wäldern, beim inzwischen devastierten Ort Gohra, südlich von Lichterfeld und am Mahlenzteich bei Nehesdorf. Die Zuflüsse vereinigten sich anschließend bei Sorno. Von hier aus verlief der Hauptfloßgraben über Oppelhain quer durch die östliche Liebenwerdaer und die Plessaer Heide bis an die Schwarze Elster bei Plessa und weiter bis Elsterwerda. Dieses Bauvorhaben verlief relativ unkompliziert, denn die Baumeister hatten in der Vergangenheit schon bei ähnlichen Projekten in Sachsen Erfahrungen gesammelt. Der Floßgraben wurde schließlich bereits 1743 fertig gestellt und im darauf folgenden Jahr in Betrieb genommen., Heikler wurde das Projekt im Abschnitt zwischen der Schwarzen Elster und Elbe. Der Wasserspiegel am geplanten Ausmündungsbereich in der Elbe lag höher als in Elsterwerda. In einfachen Floßgräben wurde das Holz aber in der Fließrichtung des Gewässers bewegt beziehungsweise getriftet. Deshalb musste stattdessen ein Kanal angelegt werden, der die Höhenunterschiede mittels Schleusen überwand. Erste Entwürfe dafür legte Ingenieur Johannes Müller, der mit den Voruntersuchungen beauftragt war, im Jahre 1727 vor. Wegen der zahlreichen Untersuchungen, Berechnungen und Prüfungen verschob sich der Baubeginn letztlich wieder um über ein Jahrzehnt, weil der Bau rentabel werden sollte. Außerdem gab es heftige Diskussionen über die Streckenführung; eine Linie von Prieschka nach Stehla war ebenfalls erwogen worden, stieß aber auf heftige Gegenwehr seitens nicht näher genannter \\"einflussreicher Persönlichkeiten\\", die diese Strecke unter anderem für zu kostspielig hielten. Auch wurde die Streckenführung zwischen Elsterwerda und Grödel mehrmals verändert. Der Bau des Kanals begann schließlich erst, nachdem August der Starke im Jahre 1733 verstorben war, im Jahre 1742 unter dem Kurfürsten Friedrich AugustII., Mit der Durchführung des Baus wurde Müller selbst beauftragt, der zuvor schon mit dem Bau des Hauptfloßgrabens betraut worden war. Die Fertigstellung des Kanals war für das Jahr 1744 vorgesehen. Die Ausführung stieß allerdings auf zahlreiche Hindernisse. Die Aushubarbeiten waren sehr aufwendig, ausreichend zuverlässige Arbeitskräfte zu finden erwies sich als schwierig, die Anbindung zur Elbe und die Prösener Schleuse machten Probleme. Wegen des ungünstigen Baugrundes– die Konstrukteure hatten dort vor allem mit Schwemmsand zu kämpfen– musste diese Schleuse mehrfach erneuert werden und erst im Jahre 1767 funktionierte sie zufriedenstellend. Auf die direkte Anbindung an die Elbe verzichtete man letztlich., Nach sechs Jahren Bauzeit und nachdem er kurz zuvor geflutet worden war: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Elsterwerda, Grödel-Floßkanal, Wasserstraße, Holztransport, Naherholung, Schifffahrt, Kanal, Wasserweg, Floßgraben, Schwarze Elster"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flugmeteorologie, Klimatologie, Meteorologische Größe, Wasser (Hydrologie)], Die Luftfeuchtigkeit oder Luftfeuchte ist der Gewichtsanteil des gasförmigen Wasserdampfs in Luft. In der Luft schwebendes flüssiges Wasser (zum Beispiel Regentropfen, Nebeltröpfchen) oder Eis (zum Beispiel Schneekristalle) werden der Luftfeuchtigkeit folglich nicht zugerechnet. Die Luftfeuchtigkeit ist eine wichtige Kenngröße für zahlreiche technische und meteorologische Vorgänge, für viele Lebensvorgänge bei Lebewesen sowie für Gesundheit und Behaglichkeit der Menschen., In Abhängigkeit von Temperatur und Druck kann ein gegebenes Luftvolumen nur eine gewisse Höchstmenge Wasserdampf enthalten. Die \\"relative Luftfeuchtigkeit\\", die das geläufigste Maß für die Luftfeuchtigkeit ist, beträgt dann 100 %. Allgemein gibt die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit, ausgedrückt in Prozent (%), das Gewichtsverhältnis des momentanen Wasserdampfgehalts zu dem Wasserdampfgehalt an, der für die aktuelle Temperatur und den aktuellen Druck maximal möglich ist. Durch die Aufnahme von Wasserdampf wird die Luftdichte verringert, da bei gleich bleibendem Gesamtdruck eine hinzugefügte Anzahl von H2O-Molekülen dieselbe Anzahl von schwereren N2- und O2-Molekülen verdrängt., Luftfeuchtigkeit., Absolute Luftfeuchtigkeit: Ist die in einem bestimmten Luftvolumen \\"V\\" enthaltene Wasserdampfmasse \\"m\\"W. Übliche Einheit: g/m3., Maximale Luftfeuchtigkeit: Ist die bei einer bestimmten Temperatur maximal mögliche absolute Luftfeuchtigkeit (\\"f\\"max). Sie wird erreicht, wenn der Wasserdampfpartialdruck in der Luft so groß wie der Sättigungsdampfdruck des Wassers bei der entsprechenden Temperatur ist. Bei diesem Zustand ist die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit 100 %. Übliche Einheit: g/m3., Relative Luftfeuchtigkeit: Ist das Verhältnis der tatsächlich enthaltenen zur maximal möglichen Masse an Wasserdampf in der Luft; oder anders ausgedrückt das Verhältnis zwischen der absoluten Luftfeuchte und der maximalen Luftfeuchte. Als Quotient zweier Größen mit derselben Einheit ist dies eine Größe der Dimension Zahl; sie wird meistens in der Hilfsmaßeinheit Prozent angegeben:, Allgemeines., Ein wasserdampffreies Luftgemisch bezeichnet man als trockene Luft. Tabellen zur Zusammensetzung der Luft beziehen sich in der Regel auf trockene Luft, da der Wasserdampfanteil feuchter Luft mit 0 bis 4 Volumenprozent vergleichsweise sehr stark schwankt. Beeinflusst wird die Luftfeuchtigkeit vor allem durch die Verfügbarkeit von Wasser, die Temperatur und den Grad der Durchmischung der Atmosphäre. Höhere Lufttemperaturen ermöglichen eine höhere Wasserdampfkonzentration in der Luft. Bei sehr geringen Konzentrationen von Wasserdampf in der Luft bezeichnet man die Luftfeuchtigkeit auch als Spurenfeuchtigkeit bzw. Spurenfeuchte., Physikalische Grundlagen., Verdunstung und Kondensation., An einer freien Wasseroberfläche, die flüssiges Wasser vom darüberliegenden Luftvolumen trennt, treten stets einzelne Wassermoleküle vom Wasservolumen in das Luftvolumen über. Im flüssigen Wasser sind die Wassermoleküle durch molekulare Kräfte, vor allem durch die Wasserstoffbrückenbindungen, vergleichsweise stark aneinander gebunden, wodurch sich der zusammenhängende Flüssigkeitsverbund erst ausbilden kann. Infolge ihrer thermischen Bewegung tragen die Wassermoleküle jedoch jeweils gewisse Beträge an kinetischer Energie, die um einen temperaturabhängigen Mittelwert herum streuen (Maxwell-Boltzmann-Verteilung). Ein kleiner Anteil von Wassermolekülen hat daher stets genügend thermische Energie, um die Bindungskräfte der umgebenden Moleküle zu überwinden, die Wasseroberfläche zu verlassen und in das Luftvolumen überzugehen, also zu verdunsten. Die Verdunstungsrate, das ist die Menge an verdunstendem Wasser je Zeitspanne, hängt vom Anteil derjenigen Moleküle ab, deren kinetische Energie die Bindungsenergie des Flüssigkeitsverbundes überschreitet, und wird unter anderem von der herrschenden Temperatur bestimmt., Umgekehrt treffen verdunstete Wassermoleküle aus der Luft auch wieder auf die Wasseroberfläche und können dort je nach ihrer kinetischen Energie mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit vom Molekülverbund eingefangen werden, also kondensieren. Die Kondensationsrate ist nur vom Partialdruck des Wasserdampfes in der Luft abhängig, nicht aber von dem Anteil des Luftdrucks, den die anderen Bestandteile der Luft liefern., Vier Größen beeinflussen die Menge dieses Stoffaustauschs:, Sättigung., Betrachtet man einen Verdunstungsvorgang bei konstanter Temperatur und anfangs trockener Luft, so stellt sich die der Temperatur entsprechende Verdunstungsrate ein, während die Kondensationsrate mangels Wassermolekülen in der Luft zunächst gleich null ist. Die Verdunstungsrate ist also größer als die Kondensationsrate, und die Anzahl von Wassermolekülen in der Luft steigt daher an. Damit wächst auch die Kondensationsrate, und die Nettoverdunstung (Verdunstungsrate minus Kondensationsrate) beginnt zu sinken. Die Dichte der Wassermoleküle in der Luft und damit die Kondensationsrate steigen so lange an, bis Kondensationsrate und Verdunstungsrate gleich sind, pro Zeitspanne also ebenso viele Wassermoleküle vom Wasser in die Luft übertreten wie von der Luft ins Wasser. Dann ist der Gleichgewichtszustand erreicht, in dem die Nettoverdunstung null ist, obwohl ein ständiger Teilchenaustausch zwischen Luft und Wasser stattfindet., Die im Gleichgewichtszustand vorliegende Konzentration von Wassermolekülen in der Luft ist die \\"Sättigungsxadkonzentration\\". Steigt die Temperatur, wird sich auch eine höhere Sättigungskonzentration einstellen, da die nun ebenfalls erhöhte Verdunstungsrate zur Erreichung eines neuen Gleichgewichts durch eine höhere Kondensationsrate wieder kompensiert werden muss, was eine höhere Teilchendichte in der Luft voraussetzt. Die Höhe der Sättigungskonzentration hängt also von der Temperatur ab., Die Sättigungskonzentration wird fast allein durch die Eigenschaften der Wassermoleküle und ihre Wechselwirkung mit der Wasseroberfläche bestimmt, es besteht keine wesentliche Wechselwirkung mit den anderen Atmosphärengasen. Wären jene Gase nicht vorhanden, so würde sich über dem Wasser praktisch dieselbe Sättigungskonzentration einstellen. Die umgangssprachlich gebräuchliche und wegen der Einfachheit auch in Fachkreisen weit verbreitete Ausdrucksweise, \\"die Luft\\" könne bei gegebener Temperatur maximal eine bestimmte Menge an Wasserdampf \\"aufnehmen\\", ist irreführend. Die Luft nimmt die Feuchtigkeit nicht analog zu einem Schwamm auf, und auch der Begriff der Sättigung darf hier nicht analog zur Sättigung einer Lösung verstanden werden. Die Luft besteht aus selbstständig agierenden Gasteilchen, die im Wesentlichen nur über Stöße wechselwirken. Weder ist also Sauerstoff im Stickstoff, noch Wasserdampf in den anderen Luftbestandteilen gelöst., Die Sättigungskonzentration ist somit von der kinetischen Energie der Wasserteilchen abhängig., Aus demselben Grund wird die Sättigungskonzentration nicht von der Temperatur der Luft bestimmt, sondern von der Temperatur der verdunstenden Oberfläche. Der Bezug auf die Temperatur der Luft ist in der Alltagspraxis oft gerechtfertigt, da verdunstende Flächen geringer thermischer Trägheit meist näherungsweise Lufttemperatur annehmen (zum Beispiel an der Luft trocknende Wäsche). Ist jedoch die verdunstende Oberfläche deutlich wärmer als die Luft, so verdunsten die Wassermoleküle mit einer der Oberflächentemperatur entsprechenden Verdunstungsrate in die kühlere Luft hinein (heiße Herdplatte), auch wenn deren Sättigungskonzentration dabei überschritten wird. Ein Teil der Feuchtigkeit kondensiert dann in der Luft an den kühleren Aerosolen, welche Lufttemperatur angenommen haben, und wird als Dampf- oder Nebelschwaden sichtbar (zum Beispiel Dunstschwaden über einem herbstlichen See). Ist die Oberfläche wesentlich kühler als die Luft, so kann unter Umständen auch der Feuchtigkeitsgehalt teilgesättigter Luft dort zu Übersättigung und Kondensation an der Oberfläche führen (zum Beispiel beschlagene Fenster in Küche oder Bad oder die Wasserzunahme in einem Tauteich). Genauer gesagt kondensiert der Wasserdampf zu Wasser (zu Tau, wenn die Oberflächentemperatur unter dem Taupunkt, oder zu Reif, wenn sie unter dem Reifpunkt liegt, siehe dazu auch unten)., Übersättigung., Erhöht man durch eine Zufuhr von Wassermolekülen deren Konzentration über die Sättigungskonzentration (Übersättigung), so steigt wegen der größeren Dichte an Wassermolekülen in der Luft die Kondensationsrate vorübergehend über die Verdunstungsrate hinaus an und die Konzentration an Wassermolekülen sinkt daher wieder auf den Gleichgewichtswert., Auch hier ist zu beachten, dass es sich nicht etwa um ein \\"Unvermögen der Luft\\" handelt, den überschüssigen Wasserdampf \\"zu halten\\". Vielmehr nutzt der Wasserdampf unter diesen Bedingungen eine sich darbietende Kondensationsfläche, um seine Konzentration durch heterogene Kondensation auf die Sättigungskonzentration zu senken. Fehlen solche Kondensationsflächen oder Kondensationskerne, so kann die Luft dauerhaft erhebliche Mengen von Wasserdampf aufnehmen, bis es schließlich zu einer spontanen Entstehung von Wassertröpfchen (homogene Kondensation) kommt; siehe dazu auch den Abschnitt \\"Oberflächenkrümmung des Wassers.\\" Dies ist zum Beispiel in großen Volumina möglichst reiner Luft, also bei einer geringen Aerosolkonzentration, und bei großer Entfernung von etwaigen Umschließungsflächen der Fall (siehe Nebelkammer). Spontane Kondensation von Wasserdampf zu Wassertröpfchen findet ohne Kondensationskeime erst bei extremer Übersättigung von mehreren hundert Prozent relativer Feuchtigkeit statt. In der Praxis ist jedoch fast immer eine ausreichend große Menge von Aerosolen in der Luft vorhanden, sodass es in der Atmosphäre kaum zu Übersättigungen von mehreren Prozentpunkten kommt., Teilsättigung., Die Verdunstungsrate des Wassers kann bestimmte Maximalwerte nicht überschreiten. Es dauert daher längere Zeit, bis sich das Gleichgewicht nach einer Störung wieder eingestellt hat. Wurde zum Beispiel durch nächtliche Abkühlung ein Teil des Feuchtigkeitsgehalts auskondensiert, so ist die Luft nach einer Erwärmung zunächst ungesättigt und kann den Sättigungszustand nur langsam wieder erreichen. Diese Teilsättigung ist: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Flugmeteorologie, Klimatologie, Meteorologische Größe, Wasser (Hydrologie), Luftfeuchtigkeit, Temperatur, Druck, relative Luftfeuchtigkeit, absolute Luftfeuchtigkeit, maximale Luftfeuchtigkeit, physikalische Grundlagen"},{"prompt":"poem: a girl i met on class 12 which is final year of schooling, meeting her was unexpected, she gave so much love always and i could not understand why, she stands by my side all the time when i am happy when i am sad even when i don't feel like talking to anyone, no matter for how many days we don't talk our reamins the same that is why she is my best friend i wish her happiness and success, i wanna in her wedding it's like a dream to me, i want to grow old with her as her life partner but in a besst friend's face","completion":"In the final year of schooling, fate did intervene, A girl so unexpected, became a beautiful scene.

Juli 1606 in Leiden; † 4. Oktober 1669 in Amsterdam), bekannt unter seinem Vornamen Rembrandt, gilt als einer der bedeutendsten und bekanntesten niederländischen Künstler des Barock. Sein Schaffen fiel in die Epoche des Goldenen Zeitalters, als die Niederlande eine politische, wirtschaftliche und künstlerische Blütezeit erlebten. Rembrandt studierte bei Pieter Lastman, eröffnete 1625 in Leiden sein erstes Atelier und zog bald Aufmerksamkeit auf sich. 1631 siedelte er nach Amsterdam um, wo er sich zu einem gefeierten Künstler entwickelte. Trotzdem litt er zeitweise unter erheblichen finanziellen Problemen, ging 1656 in Insolvenz und starb in Armut., Rembrandt betätigte sich als Maler, Radierer und Zeichner, führte eine Werkstatt und bildete Künstler aus. Sein Gesamtwerk umfasst unter anderem Porträts, Landschaften sowie biblische und mythologische Themen. Zu seinen bekanntesten Arbeiten zählen \\"Die Blendung Simsons\\", \\"Die Nachtwache\\", \\"Die Anatomie des Dr. Tulp\\" und \\"Das Hundertguldenblatt\\". In seinen Historiendarstellungen griff Rembrandt zahlreiche Motive auf, die bis dahin nicht künstlerisch bearbeitet worden waren, oder er suchte nach neuen Darstellungsmöglichkeiten traditioneller Motive. Viele dieser Werke zeichnen sich durch starke Hell-Dunkel-Kontraste aus, weshalb er als ein Meister des Chiaroscuro gilt., Rembrandt wurde bereits zu Lebzeiten durch Nachstiche und Kopien seiner Bilder rezipiert. Nach seinem Tod wurde seine koloristische Malweise in der Kunstkritik und Kunstliteratur des Klassizismus negativ bewertet, während sich seine Werke bei Sammlern großer Beliebtheit erfreuten und hohe Preise erzielten. Im 18.Jahrhundert fand Rembrandt Nachfolger unter deutschen und englischen Künstlern. Sein Leben wurde in dieser Zeit mystifiziert und mit Legenden ausgeschmückt. Erst in der Mitte des 19.Jahrhunderts wurde aus diesem Rembrandt-Bild durch Quellenforschung seine reale Biographie extrahiert. Seit den 1970er Jahren erforscht das \\"Rembrandt Research Project\\" Rembrandts Werke und untersucht diese auf ihre Authentizität hin. Von einst über 700 Rembrandt zugeschriebenen Bildern, gelten heute nur noch etwa 350 tatsächlich als Werke von seiner Hand., Leben., Kindheit und Ausbildung., Rembrandt wurde am 15. Juli 1606 in Leiden als achtes von neun Kindern geboren. Die Eltern waren der Müller Harmen Gerritszoon van Rijn und dessen Frau Neeltgen Willemsdochter van Zuytbrouck, eine Bäckerstochter. Wie viele andere Kinder der Stadt besuchte Rembrandt zwischen 1612 und 1616 die Grundschule und anschließend, von 1616 bis 1620, die streng calvinistische Lateinschule. Dort wurde er in Biblischer Geschichte und den Klassikern unterrichtet. Zudem erhielt Rembrandt Rhetorikunterricht, der möglicherweise seine Malerei beeinflusste. Nach der achtjährigen Schulzeit schrieb er sich an der philosophischen Fakultät der Universität Leiden ein., Dieses Studium brach er nach kurzer Zeit ab, um eine Ausbildung zum Maler zu beginnen. Von 1620 bis 1624 war er Schüler von Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburgh. Der in Italien geschulte Lehrer hatte sich auf Architekturmalerei und die szenische Darstellung der Hölle spezialisiert und vermittelte seinem Schüler die Grundlagen der Malerei. Die Gestaltung des Feuers in den Bildnissen der Hölle hat möglicherweise Rembrandts Interesse an der Darstellung des Lichtes geweckt. Im Anschluss absolvierte er 1624 eine sechsmonatige Lehrzeit bei dem Historienmaler Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam, die ihn stärker prägte als die vorherige Ausbildung. Lastman führte ihn in die Historienmalerei ein, die in der damals gültigen Rangordnung der Malereigattungen die höchste Position innehatte. Die Ausbildung bei zwei Meistern war zu der damaligen Zeit nicht ungewöhnlich., Beginn des Berufslebens., 1625 kehrte Rembrandt nach Leiden zurück. Dort gründete er mit seinem Freund Jan Lievens eine eigene Werkstatt. Er widmete sich vor allem der Historienmalerei nach dem Vorbild seines Lehrers Lastman und physiognomischen Studien. Drei Jahre später fertigte er erstmals eine Radierung an und begann, Schüler aufzunehmen. Im selben Jahr zeigte der Sekretär des Statthalters Friedrich Heinrich, Constantijn Huygens, der im November 1628 Leiden besuchte, Interesse an der Kunst Rembrandts. In der Folge unterstützte er den Künstler und vermittelte ihm Aufträge. So konnte Rembrandt in den Jahren 1629 und 1630 zwei Bilder an die englische Krone veräußern. \\"Die Auferweckung des Lazarus\\" und \\"Judas bringt die dreißig Silberlinge zurück\\" wurden mehrmals durch andere Künstler kopiert. Am 27. April 1630 starb Rembrandts Vater., Nach seinen ersten Erfolgen und angezogen von der steigenden Bedeutung der niederländischen Hauptstadt, gab Rembrandt 1631 das gemeinsam mit Lievens betriebene Leidener Atelier auf und zog nach Amsterdam. Dort kaufte er sich bei dem Kunsthändler Hendrick van Uylenburgh ein, der eine große Werkstatt besaß, in der Kopien hergestellt und Restaurierungen durchgeführt wurden. Schon nach kurzer Zeit erhielt Rembrandt von reichen Kaufleuten Porträtaufträge. Im folgenden Jahr kaufte Statthalter Friedrich Heinrich auf Vermittlung von Constantijn Huygens einige Gemälde Rembrandts und gab einen Passionszyklus in Auftrag. Ebenfalls im Jahr 1632 erhielt Rembrandt den Auftrag für das Bild \\"Die Anatomie des Dr.Tulp\\", das er im selben Jahr fertigstellte. Insgesamt entstanden in diesem Jahr 30 Gemälde. Rembrandt arbeitete wohl als Werkstattleiter für Uylenburgh, denn vor der Aufnahme in die Amsterdamer Gilde und der damit verbundenen Selbständigkeit musste er zunächst bei einem anderen Meister oder in einer Werkstatt tätig gewesen sein., Selbständigkeit und Ehe., Am 2. Juli 1634 heiratete Rembrandt Saskia van Uylenburgh, die Nichte seines Kunsthändlers und Tochter eines wohlhabenden Patriziers. Im selben Jahr trat er der Lukasgilde bei. Dies ermöglichte ihm, als selbstständiger Meister Lehrlinge und Schüler auszubilden. Im Jahr 1635 arbeitete er unter anderem an den Bildern \\"Die Opferung Isaaks\\" und \\"Simson bedroht seinen Schwiegervater\\". Rembrandts erster Sohn, am 15. Dezember 1635 auf den Namen Rombertus (andere Schreibweise Rombartus) getauft, starb nach wenigen Monaten. 1636 zog das Ehepaar, das bis dahin immer noch beim Kunsthändler Uylenburgh gewohnt hatte, in die \\"Nieuwe Doelenstraat\\" um. Neben seiner künstlerischen Tätigkeit handelte Rembrandt dort mit Kunstwerken und baute eine Sammlung von historischen und wissenschaftlichen Objekten, Pflanzen und Tieren sowie Exotika (Gegenständen aus fernen Ländern wie Indien) auf. 1638 verklagte Rembrandt die Verwandten seiner Frau in einem Beleidigungsprozess, weil diese ihr Verschwendung vorgeworfen hatten. Diesen Vorwurf begründeten die Verwandten Saskias damit, dass ihr Erbe von etwa 40.000 Gulden nahezu aufgebraucht war. Ebenfalls in diesem Jahr wurde seine erste Tochter namens Cornelia geboren, die kurze Zeit später verstarb., Rembrandt kaufte am 5.Januar 1639 ein neues Haus in der \\"Breestraat\\", in dem sich heute das Museum Het Rembrandthuis befindet. Dazu nahm er einen Kredit auf, den er in fünf bis sechs Jahren abzahlen wollte. In das Jahr 1639 fiel auch die Fertigstellung des letzten Bildes des Passionszyklus. Das Jahr 1640 war für Rembrandt durch zwei Schicksalsschläge gekennzeichnet: Seine zweite Tochter, die am 29.Juli auf den Namen Cornelia getauft worden war, verstarb kurz darauf. Einen Monat später starb auch die Mutter Rembrandts., Künstlerisch vollzog sich bei ihm eine Wende, als er begann, sich auch der Landschaftsmalerei und dem Radieren von Landschaften zu widmen. Sein zweiter Sohn Titus wurde am 22.September 1641 getauft. Im folgenden Jahr stellte Rembrandt das Bild \\"Die Nachtwache\\" fertig. Am 14.Juni 1642 verstarb seine Ehefrau Saskia. Dieses Ereignis bedeutete einen tiefen Einschnitt in Rembrandts Leben. Waren die Jahre zuvor von hoher Produktivität gekennzeichnet, ließ seine künstlerische Aktivität nun deutlich nach. Er schuf nur wenige Gemälde und Radierungen, wie das zu seinen bekanntesten Werken gehörende \\"Hundertguldenblatt\\". Zudem identifizierte er sich stark mit seiner Vaterrolle und kümmerte sich in besonderem Maße um seinen Sohn Titus. Seine familiäre Situation griff Rembrandt auch in Kunstwerken auf, wie etwa in der Zeichnung, die einen Mann beim Füttern eines Kindes zeigt. Damit sie ihn im Haushalt entlastete, holte er Geertje Dircx zu sich, die ein besonders enges Verhältnis zu Titus entwickelte. So bedachte sie ihn als Haupterben in ihrem Testament, als sie 1648 schwer erkrankte. 1649 stellte Rembrandt die wesentlich jüngere Hendrickje Stoffels ein., Finanzielle Probleme und letzte Lebensjahre., Nachdem Hendrickje Rembrandts neue Partnerin geworden war, kam es zum Streit mit Geertje Dircx. 1649 verklagte sie ihn vor Gericht auf Unterhalt und erreichte, dass Rembrandt zu einer höheren Zahlung verurteilt wurde. Als sie im darauffolgenden Jahr entgegen der vor Gericht getroffenen Absprache weiteren Schmuck verpfändete, den sie von Rembrandt bekommen hatte, sammelte dieser zusammen mit ihrem Bruder belastende Aussagen gegen sie und setzte durch, dass sie fünf Jahre in einer Besserungsanstalt (dem \\"Spinhuis\\" in Gouda) verbringen musste., Von dem sizilianischen Mäzen Antonio Ruffo erhielt Rembrandt im Jahr 1652 den Auftrag, das Bild \\"Aristoteles mit der Büste Homers\\" zu malen. Trotz der guten Auftragslage, den Erlösen aus dem Verkauf von Radierungen und den Honoraren aus seiner Lehrtätigkeit konnte er seine Schulden nicht abtragen und musste sich weiterhin Geld leihen. 1654 wurde Hendrickje Stoffels vor den Amsterdamer Kirchenrat geladen, der sie wegen unzüchtigen Zusammenlebens mit Rembrandt rügte. Sie gebar die dritte Tochter Rembrandts, die ebenfalls Cornelia genannt und am 30.Oktober 1654 getauft wurde., Rembrandt überschrieb am 17.Mai 1656 sein Haus auf seinen Sohn Titus, bevor er kurz darauf für zahlungsunfähig erklärt wurde. In den beiden darauffolgenden Jahren wurden das Haus und seine Sammlung versteigert. Mit dem Erlös konnten die Schulden nicht vollständig beglichen werden. Rembrandt zog daraufhin in die \\"Rozengracht\\" um, wo vor allem sozial schwächere Schichten wohnten.

Der Text stammt von Pierre Delanoë, die Musik schrieb Bécaud wie üblich selbst. Begleitet wird er dabei, wie es in dieser Zeit häufig der Fall war, vom Orchester Raymond Bernard; eine besondere Rolle spielt hierin der Wechselgesang zwischen dem Solisten und einem (namenlosen) Chor., Hinter dem „schlichten, harmlos klingenden Titel“ verbirgt sich „eine starke, zeitlose Botschaft“: Das Lied wendet sich mit künstlerischen Mitteln gegen Vorurteile, Xenophobie und Lynchjustiz, und es appelliert an die Akzeptanz des Andersartigen, Vielfältigen. Jérôme Pintoux nennt das Chanson „ein Psychodrama über Sündenböcke, Hass auf Einzelgänger und Hexenjagd (kollektive Hysterie)“., Mittlerweile gilt das Lied als eines der prägnantesten Stücke aus Bécauds Karriere und ist auch auf den meisten neueren Zusammenstellungen seiner größten Erfolge enthalten., Text und Musik., Handlung und Inszenierung., Das Lied beschreibt einen Dialog zwischen einer anonymen Gruppe von Menschen und einem Einzelnen (Motiv des „alle gegen einen“), den diese des Diebstahls einer Orange bei einem Kaufmann bezichtigen., Wie es für viele Chansons von Gilbert Bécaud typisch ist, wird auch hier eine eher alltägliche Situation mit prägnanten Beteiligten dargestellt. Dabei wird der Hörer aber durch eine dichte Stimmung angesprochen, die der Sänger mit seinem Hang zum theatralischen Vortrag bei seinen Bühnen- und Filmauftritten noch verstärkte. Das Thema von \\"L’Orange\\" war „für eine dramatische Inszenierung wie geschaffen“. Durch den Wechselgesang zwischen einem gemischten Chor –in den ersten beiden Strophen nur die Männer-, danach auch die Frauenstimmen– und dem Solisten wird eine Atmosphäre erzeugt, die beim Zuhörer aufgrund ihrer sich steigernden Aggressivität ein Gefühl der Beklemmung hervorruft. Dieser akustische Eindruck wird in einem französischen Schwarz-Weiß-TV-Videoclip aus den 1960er Jahren auch bildlich unterstrichen und für den Betrachter sichtbar gemacht, denn die anonyme Menschenmenge, in deren Mitte der Sänger sich wie ein Tier in einem Käfig hin und her bewegt, ist lediglich zu hören, wird aber nie von der Kamera erfasst., Für die Menschengruppe steht von vorneherein fest, dass dieser junge Mann der Dieb ist \\"(„Tu as volé l’orange“ – „Du hast die Orange gestohlen“)\\", wobei sich durch das in den ersten beiden Strophen insgesamt 18-malige Wiederholen von \\"as volé\\" (was der textlichen Entsprechung eines Ostinato nahe kommt) schon gleich zu Beginn eine für den Bezichtigten bedrohliche Situation entwickelt, weil er bis auf ein kurzes, gerufenes \\"„Nein!“\\" zunächst überhaupt nicht zu Wort kommt. Und als er das dann ab der dritten Strophe doch tut, singt er teilweise gegen den Chor an, was als ein Ausdruck des Ignorierens von Seiten der Gruppe beziehungsweise des Aneinander-vorbei-Redens verstanden werden kann., Auf seine Erwiderung, er habe das Obst nicht gestohlen und selbst viel zu viel Angst vor Dieben \\"(„trop peur des voleurs“)\\", hält ihm der Chor entgegen, nur er könne es gewesen sein, denn er sei böse und hässlich \\"(„méchant et laid“)\\", außerdem klebe doch Fruchtsaft wie Blut an seinen Langfingern \\"(„comme du sang sur tes doigts“ … „avec tes mains crochues“)\\"– und schließlich habe ihn auch noch jemand bei der Tat gesehen. Dabei werden die einzelnen Vorwürfe jeweils im Wechsel von einer Frauen- oder einer Männerstimme vorgebracht; die Sopranstimme steigert sich hier punktuell bis in einen Bereich, der von Tonhöhe und Klangfarbe her den Eindruck einer heulenden Furie oder Rachegöttin hervorruft. Der Beschuldigte entgegnet, er sei gar nicht bei dem Kaufmann gewesen, sondern, die Augen zum Himmel gewandt, auf der Suche nach einem blauen Vogel durch die umliegenden Berge gewandert \\"(„je cherchais dans la montagne, les étoiles dans les yeux, l’oiseau bleu“)\\". Der blaue Vogel ist in der französischen Literatur ein der blauen Blume der Romantik verwandtes Symbol für Sehnsucht und Liebe, seit Marie-Catherine d’Aulnoy 1697 ein gleichnamiges Märchen veröffentlichte. Auch in Chansontexten taucht dieser Begriff wiederholt auf, nicht selten sogar ebenfalls in Kombination mit der Redewendung \\"„avoir des étoiles\\" (oder \\"la lumière\\") \\"dans les yeux“\\" (auf Deutsch „vor Glück oder Erstaunen strahlende Augen haben“), beispielsweise in Marie Myriams Siegertitel \\"L’oiseau et l’enfant\\" beim Eurovision Song Contest 1977. Damit werden Kinder oder erwachsene Träumer beschrieben., Diese vergleichsweise Naivität der Replik des Beschuldigten auf einen handfesten Vorwurf trägt ebenfalls zur Dramatik der Handlung bei; hier prallen gleichsam zwei Welten aufeinander. Zudem ändern seine Rechtfertigungsversuche nichts daran, dass alle anderen von seiner Täterschaft überzeugt sind, anscheinend auch unabhängig davon, was immer er noch an Argumenten anführen könnte. Letzteres tut er allerdings nicht, sondern wiederholt lediglich die beiden Strophen mit seiner Erklärung. Stattdessen kulminiert die Situation durch das „Verdikt“ der Menge: Man habe den Mann mit seinen Wolfszähnen schon länger beobachtet, und nun ziehe sich der Strick um seinen Hals zu \\"(„longtemps qu’on te guettait avec tes dents de loup … t’auras la corde au cou!“)\\". Dies sei sein letzter Tag, und überhaupt sei er bloß ein dreckiger Dieb, außerdem ein Fremder, der Unglück bringe \\"(„tu n’es qu’un sale voleur … D’abord tu n’es qu’un étranger et tu portes malheur“)\\". Die Häufung von Stereotypen beziehungsweise Klischees in den vom Chor vorgetragenen Anschuldigungen und Aussagen unterstreicht die Feststellung, dass der Mann für die Menge von vorneherein als Täter feststand. Zu diesem Eindruck wie zur Bedrohlichkeit des Szenarios trägt auch der Kontrast zwischen dem vermeintlichen Anlass und der möglichen Strafe bei; der Wert einer einzelnen Orange (Mundraub, in Frankreich schon damals aber kein eigenständiger Straftatbestand) steht in keiner vernünftigen Relation zu den übersteigerten Charakterisierungen des möglichen Delinquenten durch Volkes Stimme und den ihm drohenden Konsequenzen., Das Lied endet, wie es begonnen hat– mit der vielfach wiederholten Feststellung \\"„Tu as volé as volé as volé … l’orange“\\" durch den Chor, in die der von der Menge Verurteilte ein abschließendes, eher hilfloses \\"„Vous êtes fous!“\\" („Ihr seid verrückt!“) hineinruft., Die fehlende Strophe., Der Originaltext von Delanoë enthält noch eine letzte Strophe, die zwar auf der offiziellen Webseite des Texters, aber weder auf der Original-Schallplatte noch in den filmischen Darbietungen des Chansons aus den 1960er Jahren enthalten ist. Darin wird aus der bedrohlichen Andeutung, dass er den Strick um seinen Hals tragen werde, Gewissheit:, Die Frage, wer diese Kürzung veranlasst hat –denkbar wäre beispielsweise die Plattenfirma– und aus welchem Grund dies geschah, lässt sich aus den vorliegenden Quellen nicht beantworten. Ob dies beabsichtigt war oder nicht– im Ergebnis dient auch dieses Nichtaussprechen oder in Unsicherheit schweben lassen hinsichtlich des letzten Schritts der Ereignisse dazu, dass der Zuhörer im Sinne der psychologischen Suspenseforschung zum „teilnehmenden, mitfühlenden Beobachter“ werden kann., Musik., Musikalisch ist die in g-Moll und im Viervierteltakt gehaltene Melodie durch ein schnelles, straffes, abschnittsweise mitreißendes Tempo geprägt, bei dem der Sänger kaum am Piano sitzen bleiben kann, wie eine etwas spätere Filmaufnahme veranschaulicht. In dieser ist das Lied zudem um ein vierzig Sekunden langes instrumentales Intro ergänzt, in dem Bécaud am Klavier –ausschließlich begleitet von einer Rhythmusgruppe aus Schlagzeug, Standbass und E-Gitarre– einen jazzigen Auftakt präsentiert, der starke Ähnlichkeiten mit Hit the Road Jack von Ray Charles aufweist. Insbesondere am Ende dieser Filmaufnahme bearbeitet Bécaud sein Instrument auf eine höchst aggressive Weise –so schlägt er beispielsweise den Tastaturdeckel mehrfach gegen den Klangkasten, eine Spielweise, der insbesondere Jerry Lee Lewis im Rock ’n’ Roll zur Popularität verholfen hat–, die zugleich deutlich macht, weshalb der Franzose verbreitet als „Monsieur 100.000 Volts“ bezeichnet wurde.Über die Identität der Chorsänger, die hier ja einen unüblich hohen Gesangsanteil aufweisen, keineswegs nur im Hintergrund, sondern gleichberechtigt mit dem Solisten agieren, ist nichts bekannt. Die Namen von \\"Background Vocalists\\" und Studiomusikern wurden Mitte der 1960er Jahre in der Unterhaltungsmusik allerdings auch nur selten dokumentiert., Entstehung., Die Entstehung dieses Chansons ist für die Arbeitsweise des langjährigen Duos Delanoë/Bécaud nicht untypisch: Bécaud benötigte im September 1963 für einen bevorstehenden Auftritt im Olympia noch etwas neues Material, aber der Texter hatte gerade nichts vorrätig. Darauf forderte der Sänger ihn auf, ihm das erste Wort, das ihm spontan einfiele, mitzuteilen– das war das Wort Orange. Etwas Simples wie das Pflücken, Schälen oder Verkaufen dieser Frucht kam für beide nicht in Frage, stattdessen landeten sie beim Diebstahl, was laut Delanoë „eine dramatische Dimension ergab. Der antirassistische Aspekt kam dann ganz zwangsläufig hinein.“, Die beiden hatte zwischenzeitlich auch die Frage beschäftigt, welchen Titel dieses Lied bekommen sollte. Im Gespräch war anfangs \\"L’étranger\\" \\"(Der Fremde)\\", aber auch Ironischeres wie \\"La belle et douce ville\\" \\"(Die schöne, liebliche Stadt)\\" oder \\"Plein d’hônnetes gens\\" \\"(Voller ehrenwerter Leute)\\", ehe sie sich für \\"L’Orange\\" entschieden.Schon vor dem Entstehen des Texts hatte Bécaud offenbar einen ganz bestimmten Musikstil im Kopf gehabt– es sollte etwas in Richtung Gospel werden. Nachdem er dazu die Musik einschließlich der Chorstimmen komponiert hatte, empfand der Texter das Ergebnis als ein „besonders starkes Stück“., Rezeption, Erfolge und Coverversionen., Gilles Verlant weist darauf hin, dass \\"L’Orange\\" beileibe nicht das einz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Chanson, Lied, Gilbert Bécaud, Orange, Vorurteile, Lynchjustiz, Botschaft, Chor, Musik, Diebstahl."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Biologiegeschichte, Ernst Haeckel, Evolution, Wissenschaftliche Kontroverse, Wissenschaftstheorie der Biologie], Die Embryonenkontroverse war ein Streit um Fälschungsvorwürfe gegenüber dem Evolutionsbiologen Ernst Haeckel. In der 1868 publizierten \\"Natürlichen Schöpfungsgeschichte\\" versuchte Haeckel, die noch junge Evolutionsbiologie durch eine laienverständliche Darstellung zu popularisieren. Dabei wurde die Embryologie als zentrales Argument präsentiert: Die Individualentwicklung eines Lebewesens, die Ontogenese, rekapituliere dessen stammesgeschichtliche Entwicklung, dessen Phylogenese (Biogenetische Grundregel), und sei daher nur im Rahmen eines evolutionären Modells zu erklären., Dieses Argument wurde durch Abbildungen gestützt, die die Ähnlichkeiten zwischen Embryonen verschiedener Arten belegen sollten. Einige Zeichnungen unterschlugen jedoch bekannte Unterschiede. Andere Darstellungen waren identische Kopien eines Embryo-Holzschnitts und wurden ohne entsprechende Angabe zur Illustration verschiedener Arten verwendet. Derartige Manipulationen trugen Haeckel Kritik und Fälschungsvorwürfe von wissenschaftlichen Kollegen und Öffentlichkeit ein., Haeckels herausgehobene Stellung in den Debatten um die Evolutionstheorie führte zu einer breiten Rezeption der Kontroverse. Haeckel war nicht nur der bekannteste Vertreter der Evolutionstheorie in Deutschland, er erklärte sein Eintreten für den Darwinismus zudem zu einem allgemeinen Weltanschauungskampf gegen die traditionelle Biologie, „Kirchen-Weisheit und […] After-Philosophie“. In diesem Kontext verstand Haeckel die Embryologie als ein „schwere[s] Geschütz im Kampf um die Wahrheit“, was zu einer häufig feindlichen Rezeption seiner Schriften beitrug., Die embryologische Argumentation für die Evolutionstheorie., Haeckels Argumentation für die Evolutionstheorie beruhte wesentlich auf Überlegungen zur Ontogenese, also der biologischen Entwicklung individueller Organismen von der befruchteten Eizelle zum erwachsenen Lebewesen. Zwei Beobachtungen überzeugten ihn von der überragenden Bedeutung der embryologischen Forschung. Zum einen fänden sich bei Embryonen Merkmale, die bei erwachsenen Lebewesen allenfalls rudimentär vorhanden seien. So habe etwa ein menschlicher Embryo in den ersten zwei Monaten einen frei hervorstehenden Schwanz, von dem nach der Geburt lediglich drei bis fünf Schwanzwirbel übrig blieben. „Dieses verkümmerte Schwänzchen des Menschen ist ein unwiderlegbarer Zeuge für die unleugbare Thatsache, daß er von geschwänzten Voreltern abstammt.“, Haeckels zweite Beobachtung bezog sich auf die allgemeine Ähnlichkeit zwischen Embryonen von Wirbeltieren. Er argumentierte, dass die Embryonen aller Wirbeltiere zu Beginn ununterscheidbar seien und sich erst allmählich verschiedene Merkmale herausdifferenzierten. Dabei erschienen Unterschiede umso später, je näher die Arten miteinander verwandt seien. In der \\"Anthropogenie\\" aus dem Jahre 1874 illustrierte Haeckel diesen Gedanken mit einer Abbildung von acht Wirbeltierembryonen in jeweils drei Entwicklungsstadien. Auf der ersten Stufe sind die Embryonen aller Arten nahezu ununterscheidbar. In der zweiten Spalte kann man spezifische Merkmale des Fisch- und Amphibienembryos bereits klar erkennen, während die übrigen Embryonen lediglich in Details voneinander abweichen. Auf der letzten Stufe sind schließlich alle Arten klar unterscheidbar. Dennoch teilen die vier Säugetierembryonen viele morphologische Merkmale, die sie deutlich von den vier anderen Wirbeltierembryonen abgrenzen., Diese bereits von Karl Ernst von Baer beschriebenen Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den Embryonen der Wirbeltiere sind nach Haeckel jedoch nur ein Oberflächenphänomen, das auf einen grundlegenderen Zusammenhang zwischen Evolution und Individualentwicklung hinweist. Zu Beginn seien sich die Embryonen nämlich nicht nur ähnlich, vielmehr wiesen sie alle die typischen Merkmale der stammesgeschichtlich älteren Wirbeltiere auf: Selbst die gebildeten Kreise „wissen nicht, dass [der menschliche] Embryo zu einer gewissen Zeit im Wesentlichen den anatomischen Bau eines Fisches, später den Bau von Amphibien-Formen und Säugethier-Formen besitzt, und daß bei weiterer Entwicklung dieser letzteren zunächst die Formen erscheinen, welche auf der tiefsten Stufe der Säugethiere stehen“., Diese Beobachtungen kulminierten in Haeckels Formulierung des biogenetischen Grundgesetzes, nach dem die Ontogenese eine Rekapitulation der Phylogenese ist. Der menschliche Embryo soll in seiner Entwicklung also auf kurze und unvollständige Weise die Stadien der Evolution der Wirbeltiere durchlaufen. Zu Beginn fänden sich etwa beim menschlichen Embryo typische Merkmale von Fischen wie Kiemenanlagen, die im Laufe der ontogenetischen Entwicklung verschwänden. Dieser Zusammenhang wurde von Haeckel als einer der „wichtigsten und unwiderlegbaren Beweise“ der Evolutionstheorie betrachtet, da nichtevolutionäre Ansätze keine plausible Erklärung dieses Phänomens anbieten könnten., Illustrationen der \\"Natürlichen Schöpfungsgeschichte\\"., Haeckels embryologische Argumentation für die Evolutionstheorie wurde erstmals in der \\"Natürlichen Schöpfungsgeschichte\\" einer breiten Leserschaft zugänglich gemacht. Die Darstellung des biogenetischen Grundgesetzes stützte sich auf eine Reihe von Abbildungen, die als Illustrationen und Belege des Gedankengangs konzipiert waren., So zeigten drei Abbildungen angeblich die Embryonen eines Hundes, eines Huhns und einer Schildkröte. Die identische Gestalt der Darstellungen sollte den Leser davon überzeugen, dass die Embryonen der Wirbeltiere tatsächlich ein gemeinsames Entwicklungsstadium teilen: „Wenn Sie die jungen Embryonen des Hundes, des Huhns und der Schildkröte in Fig. 9, 10 und 11 vergleichen, werden Sie nicht im Stande sein, einen Unterschied wahrzunehmen.“ Die bis ins kleinste Detail gehende Übereinstimmung der Illustrationen ergab sich allerdings nur dadurch, dass die drei Abbildungen mit Hilfe desselben Druckstocks erstellt wurden. Während die Leser also die identischen Erscheinungen als Evidenz für Haeckels embryologische Thesen akzeptieren sollten, wurde der scheinbare Nachweis durch identische Kopien einer Abbildung erzeugt. In späteren Auflagen wurde als Reaktion auf Kritik nur noch eine Abbildung verwendet. Allerdings wies Haeckel darauf hin, dass die Zeichnung gleichermaßen einen Vogel- oder Säugetierembryo darstellen könnte., Eine andere Abbildung diente der Darstellung des biogenetischen Grundgesetzes auf späteren Entwicklungsstufen. Die Figuren A und B zeigen die Embryonen eines Hundes und eines Menschen in der vierten Woche. Die Figuren C–F stellen die Embryonen von Hund, Mensch, Schildkröte und Huhn in der sechsten Woche dar. Auch hier ist der Bezug zu Haeckels Argumentationsgang offensichtlich: In der vierten Woche sind die Embryonen nahezu ununterscheidbar. Selbst in der sechsten Woche ähneln sich die Säugetierembryonen stark, sind jedoch leicht von Reptilien und Vögeln zu unterscheiden., Haeckel hatte seine Zeichnungen nicht anhand echter Embryonen erstellt, sondern Illustrationen anderer Lehrbücher als Vorlagen verwendet. Da er keine Quellen für seine Zeichnungen angab, wurde schnell von Kritikern über die Herkunft der Bilder spekuliert. Ludwig Rütimeyer erklärte sie zu verfremdeten Kopien von Illustrationen Theodor von Bischoffs, Alexander Eckers und Louis Agassiz’ und warf Haeckel vor, die Darstellungen im Interesse seiner Theorie verfremdet zu haben. Haeckel wollte an dieser Stelle keinen Fehler einräumen, in einem Brief erklärte er: „Im Übrigen sind die Formen derselben ganz genau theils nach der Natur copirt, theils aus allen, bisher über diese Stadien bekannt gewordenen Abbildungen zusammengestellt.“, Die Kontroverse., Frühe Reaktionen., Bereits kurz nach der Publikation der \\"Natürlichen Schöpfungsgeschichte\\" gab es unter Fachwissenschaftlern Diskussionen um Haeckels Illustrationen. Von Bischoff beschwerte sich bei seinem Kollegen Carl von Siebold über die seines Erachtens zu freien Zeichnungen. Dieser verteidigte zunächst Haeckel und wandte sich noch 1868 per Brief an Haeckel und bat um Quellenangaben für die Zeichnungen., Derartige Zweifel wurden in den ersten Jahren jedoch nicht in der Öffentlichkeit geäußert und zeigten bei weitem nicht die Schärfe der ab 1874 geführten Kontroverse. Eine Ausnahme bildet der Basler Anatom Ludwig Rütimeyer, der seine Kritik im \\"Archiv für Anthropologie\\" publik machte. Rütimeyer empörte sich, dass Haeckels Zeichnungen als Belege und nicht als schematische Illustrationen präsentiert wurden. Dies könne „nicht anders genannt werden als Spieltreiben mit dem Publicum und der Wissenschaft“. Haeckel reagierte äußerst gereizt auf diese Vorwürfe Rütimeyers. In einem Brief an Charles Darwin interpretierte er die Kritik als eine Anbiederung an das „klerikale Basel“, das nun mal für Rütimeyers Gehalt aufkommen würde., Derweil kamen von Darwin und anderen Wissenschaftlern äußerst positive Reaktionen auf die \\"Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte\\". In der Einleitung zur 1871 erschienenen \\"Abstammung des Menschen\\" schrieb Darwin mit Bezug auf Haeckels Werk: „Wäre dieses Buch erschienen, ehe meine Arbeit niedergeschrieben war, würde ich sie vermutlich nie zu Ende geführt haben.“ Auch im Konflikt mit Rütimeyer kamen von Darwin aufbauende Worte. In einem Brief an Haeckel heißt es: „Es hat mich betrübt, vor ein oder zwei Jahren Rütimeyers Rezension gelesen zu haben. Es tut mir leid, dass er so rückschrittlich ist, auch da ich ihn sehr respektiert habe.“, Von der Evolution zur evolutionären Weltanschauung., Die \\"Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte\\" erwies sich als publizistischer Erfolg, 1874 erschien bereits die fünfte Auflage. Auch Darwins Anerkennung und positive Rezensionen in Zeitschriften wie \\"Nature\\" und \\"Das Ausland\\" trugen dazu bei, dass sich Haeckel als führender Vertreter des Darwinismus im deutschsprachigen Raum etablieren konnte. Haeckel nutzte diese Aufmerksamkeit, um neben der biologischen Evolutionstheorie eine evolutionäre Weltanschauung zu propagieren. Der Darwinismus müsse nicht nur alle biologischen Disziplinen revolutionieren, sondern erscheine als Grundlage, auf der „alle wahre Wissenschaft in Zukunft weiter bauen wird“., Haeckels Anspruch einer allgemeinen Geltung evolutionären Denkens bezog sich auch auf die Ethik und Politik. In den 1870er Jahren äußerte sich dies in Haeckels Verknüpfung der Evolutionstheorie mit dem Kulturkampf Bismarcks gegen den Katholizismus. In diesem Sinne kontrastierte Haeckel in der 1874 erschienenen \\"Anthropogenie\\" die aufkl: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Biologiegeschichte, Ernst Haeckel, Evolution, Wissenschaftliche Kontroverse, Wissenschaftstheorie der Biologie, Embryonenkontroverse, Ontogenese, Phylogenese, Embryologie, biogenetisches Grundgesetz"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Hirsche, Schwedische Phrase, Vieh], Das Ren [], [] oder Rentier (\\"Rangifer tarandus\\"), vormals \\"Renntier\\", ist eine Säugetierart aus der Familie der Hirsche (Cervidae). Es lebt zirkumpolar im Sommer in den Tundren und im Winter in der Taiga Nordeurasiens und Nordamerikas sowie auf Grönland und anderen arktischen Inseln. Es ist die einzige Hirschart, die domestiziert wurde. Der nordamerikanische Vertreter heißt Karibu., Namen., Das deutsche Wort \\"Ren\\" ist entlehnt aus schwedisch \\"ren\\", das wie norwegisch \\"rein\\" und isländisch \\"hreyn(dýr)\\" auf altnordisch \\"hreinn\\" zurückgeht. Frühe deutsche Formen lauten \\"rein\\", \\"reyner\\", \\"rainger\\". Neuenglisch \\"rein(deer)\\" aus altenglisch \\"hrān\\" und neufranzösisch \\"renne\\" aus mittelfranzösisch \\"reen\\" sind ebenfalls aus dem Nordgermanischen entlehnt, \\"reen\\" über deutsche Vermittlung 1552 aus der Kosmographie von Sebastian Münster. Das altnordische Ausgangswort gehört zu einer Gruppe von Bezeichnungen für horntragende Tiere wie \\"Hirsch\\" oder \\"Hornisse\\". Vielleicht stellt sich \\"hreinn\\" wie griechisch \\"krīós\\" „Widder“ zu einer indoeuropäischen Wurzel \\"*k̂er(ə)-\\" „das Oberste am Körper, Kopf, Horn“. Das Kompositum \\"Rentier\\" (wie schwedisch \\"rendjur\\", englisch \\"reindeer\\" und altnordisch \\"hreyndýri\\") entstand später zur Verdeutlichung; deutsch \\"Rennthier\\", seit der 2. Hälfte des 17. Jahrhunderts belegt, ist eine volksetymologische Anlehnung an \\"rennen.\\" Als Pluralformen von \\"Ren\\" sind \\"Rens\\" und \\"Rene\\" möglich. Fachsprachlich ist die Form \\"Rener\\" üblich., Zoologischen Bezeichnungen gehen auf neulateinisch \\"rangifer\\" und altgriechisch \\"tárandos\\", beides „Ren“, zurück. Bei \\"rangifer\\" ist eine Herkunft aus \\"ramus\\" „Ast“ und \\"ferre\\" „tragen“ möglich. Albertus Magnus führt ihn in \\"De Animalibus\\" um 1260 auf, Aristoteles im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. den „tárandos“ in \\"De partibus animalium\\"., Das deutsche \\"Karibu\\" stammt vom Wort \\"Qualipu\\", sprich „hal-lay-boo“, aus der Sprache des indigenen Volkes der Mi’kmaq in Ostkanada und dem US-Bundesstaat Maine. Es ist im Französischen als \\"caribou\\" erstmals 1606 belegt, im Englischen als cariboo erstmals 1665. Eingedeutscht führte Brehms Tierleben den Karibu 1865 an., Merkmale., Die Größe schwankt mit dem Verbreitungsgebiet. Die Kopf-Rumpf-Länge kann 120 bis 220 Zentimeter betragen, die Schulterhöhe 90 bis 140 Zentimeter, das Gewicht 60 bis 300 Kilogramm. Das Fell ist dicht und lang, dunkel-graubraun oder, besonders bei domestizierten Tieren, hell; im Winter ist es generell heller als im Sommer. Die auf hocharktischen Inseln Kanadas, vor allem auf der Ellesmere-Insel lebenden „Peary-Karibus“ tragen ganzjährig ein fast rein weißes Fell. Die Färbung dient als Tarnung vor Fressfeinden; die dichte Unterwolle schützt im arktischen Klima vor Kälte., Die Geweihe sind stangenförmig, verzweigt und charakteristisch nach vorne gebogen; nur die tiefste Sprosse der männlichen, unkastrierten Tiere bildet am Ende eine Verbreiterung, auch als „Schneeschaufel“ bezeichnet, da man früher annahm, das Ren räume mit ihr den Schnee beiseite. Die Formgebung der Geweihe ist unregelmäßig, asymmetrisch und bei jedem Tier unterschiedlich. Das Ren ist die einzige Hirschart, bei der auch das Weibchen regelmäßig ein Geweih trägt. Das des Männchens ist mit einer Länge von 50 bis 130 Zentimeter ausladender gegenüber nur 20 bis 50 Zentimetern beim Weibchen. Männliche Tiere werfen ihr Geweih im Herbst ab, Weibchen erst im Frühjahr. Das Abwerfen erfolgt gewöhnlich nicht zugleich beidseitig, so dass das Ren vorübergehend eine Geweihstange trägt., Die Hufe der Rentiere sind breit und durch eine Spannhaut weit spreizbar. Außerdem sind lange Afterklauen ausgebildet. Dies ermöglicht den Tieren im oft steinigen oder schlammigen Gelände sicheren Tritt., Verbreitung., Rentiere zählen zu den am weitesten nördlich lebenden Großsäugern. Sie bewohnen große Teile des nördlichen Nordamerika und Eurasien. Selbst auf hocharktischen Inseln wie Spitzbergen, der Ellesmere-Insel und Grönland kommen Rentiere vor. Um dem arktischen Winter zu entgehen, unternehmen die Renherden, wo dies möglich ist, große Wanderungen, manche bis zu 5000 Kilometern – die längste regelmäßige Wanderung von Landsäugern überhaupt., Auf dem europäischen Festland gibt es in Südnorwegen noch etwa 25.000 wildlebende Rentiere in 23 getrennten Populationen, davon 10 bis 11.000 auf der Hardangervidda. Gut die Hälfte der Populationen sind aber gemischt mit teil-domestizierten Rentieren (laut IUCN-Angaben leben dort insgesamt rund 6000 reinrassige Wild-Rentiere). Bei den großen Rentierherden Lapplands und Nordostrusslands handelt es sich ausschließlich um (geringfügig) domestizierte, „halbwilde“ Rentiere, die etwa unter der Obhut der Samen stehen., In Nordkanada reicht das Verbreitungsgebiet der Rentiere (Karibus genannt) weiter in den Süden, also in die boreale Zone. Die weiteste Verbreitung hatte das Ren in der letzten Kaltzeit; damals drang es bis zu den Pyrenäen und an die heutige mexikanische Nordgrenze vor. Mit der Erwärmung am Ende der letzten Kaltzeit begann eine Habitatverlagerung nach Norden, wobei sich das Rentier noch lange in gemäßigteren Zonen aufhielt. Vermutlich waren Menschen für das Verschwinden der Tiere aus den gemäßigten Zonen mitverantwortlich; allerdings waren die Bestände ohnehin im Abnehmen begriffen., Auf den britischen Inseln starb das Rentier vor rund 10.000 Jahren aus. 1952 wilderte der Same Mikel Utsi 29 Tiere in der schottischen Berggruppe Cairngorms aus; heute leben dort etwa 130 Rentiere. Eine Herde von rund 80 Tieren lebt auf dem Gelände der Glenlivet-Brennerei., Als Neozoon wurde das Rentier auf den Kerguelen eingeführt. Dies war auch in Südgeorgien der Fall, wo die Tierart 2014 durch norwegische Scharfschützen, die von der südgeorgischen Verwaltung unterstützt wurden, jedoch erfolgreich wieder ausgerottet werden konnte, nachdem sie viel Schaden an der Pflanzendecke angerichtet hatte., Lebensweise., Rentiere sind Herdentiere. Sie finden sich zu den jahreszeitlichen Wanderungen zusammen und können gebietsweise mehrere 100.000 Tiere umfassen; aus Alaska ist eine Herde mit 500.000 Tieren bekannt. Die weltweit größte Rentierherde war zeitweise die George-River-Herde im Osten Kanadas, die inzwischen von ehemals rund 900.000 Tieren (1980er Jahre) auf 70.000 (2011) geschrumpft ist. Nach den Wanderungen lösen sich die Herden in kleinere Verbände zu zehn bis hundert Tieren auf. Diese Gruppen mit einer Hierarchie, die sich nach der Geweihgröße richtet, bestehen meistens entweder nur aus Männchen oder nur aus Weibchen. Gelegentlich wird die Hierarchie durch ritualisierte Kämpfe entschieden., Zur Zeit der Paarung im Oktober versuchen Männchen, einen Harem um sich zu sammeln. Sie paaren sich mit so vielen Weibchen wie möglich. Nach einer Tragezeit von ungefähr 230 Tagen bringt das Weibchen ein einziges Junges zur Welt. Die Geburt erfolgt im Mai oder Juni. Das Jungtier ist, anders als die meisten Hirschkälber, nicht gefleckt und schon kurz nach der Geburt selbständig. So kann es bereits nach einer Stunde laufen. Sofern es trocken bleibt, wird das Junge durch sein aus luftgefüllten Haaren bestehendes Fell vor Kälte geschützt. Bei nasskaltem Wetter ist die Sterblichkeit der Kälber hoch, obwohl Rentierkälber ihre Wärmeerzeugung um das Fünffache beschleunigen können und damit über außergewöhnliche thermoregulatorische Fähigkeiten verfügen. Geschlechtsreif werden die Tiere nach zwei Jahren. Durchschnittlich werden sie etwa 12 bis 15 Jahre alt, gelegentlich auch mehr als 20 Jahre., Rentiere sind vor allem Grasfresser; im Sommer nehmen sie fast jede pflanzliche Kost zu sich, die sie finden können. Im Winter sind sie durch Schnee und Eis überwiegend auf Rentierflechten, Moose und Pilze beschränkt., Die natürlichen Feinde des Rens sind Wölfe, Vielfraße, Luchse und Bären. Gesunde Tiere wissen sich allerdings diesen Feinden durch ihre Laufstärke zu entziehen; so fallen den Raubtieren gewöhnlich nur kranke und geschwächte Rentiere zum Opfer. Die größte Plage stellen Innen- und Außenparasiten dar, vor allem die Myriaden von arktischen Stechmücken. Darüber hinaus hat auch die industrielle Erschließung ihres Weidelandes Auswirkungen auf ihr Überleben, wie am Beispiel der George-River-Herde vermutet., Unterarten., In verschiedenen Teilen der Welt ist das Ren durch die Bejagung zwischenzeitlich selten geworden. Heute gibt es weltweit etwa 4 Millionen wilde und 3 Millionen domestizierte Rentiere. Die Art gilt damit nicht als gefährdet. Drei Viertel der wilden Rentiere leben in Nordamerika, mehr als drei Viertel der domestizierten Rentiere in Sibirien., Man unterscheidet je nach Lehrmeinung zehn bis zwanzig Unterarten des Rentiers. Traditionell unterscheidet man zwei Hauptformen, zum einen die Tundrarentiere, zum anderen die sogenannten Waldrentiere. Unter den Tundrarentieren unterscheidet man drei kleine hocharktische Inselformen, die aber nicht alle nah verwandt sind, sowie drei Festlandformen, die aber teilweise auch auf Inseln vorkommen. Eine weitere Inselform, das ausgestorbene Queen-Charlotte-Karibu, scheint genetischen Befunden zufolge keine eigene Unterart zu repräsentieren, sondern stand den Formen des Kanadischen Festlands nahe. Die Eurasischen Waldrentiere werden traditionell in drei Formen unterteilt., Waldrentiere., Die Unterarten unterscheiden sich in Fellfärbung und Größe. Beispielsweise ist das Kanadische Waldkaribu dunkelbraun, das Europäische Rentier eher graubraun. Die kleinsten Rentiere sind die inselbewohnenden Unterarten. So ist das Spitzbergen-Ren im Durchschnitt um 15 % kleiner als das Europäische Ren., Menschen und Rentiere., Nutzung der Wildtiere., Schon auf Höhlenzeichnungen der Steinzeit findet man Rentiere dargestellt. Sie waren schon den Neandertalern eine begehrte Jagdbeute. Bis heute werden Rentiere in vielen Teilen der Welt gehalten und gejagt, da man ihr mageres Wildbret und ihr Fell schätzt. In den Regionen, in denen Großwild, Faserpflanzen und Baustoffe spärlich sind oder fehlen, haben Menschen beinahe jeden Körperteil des Rentiers genutzt: die Haut für Pelze und Leder, das Blut als Heilmittel („Saina tjalem“), Geweih und Knochen zur Werkze: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Hirsche, Schwedische Phrase, Vieh, Ren, Rentier, Rangifer tarandus, domestiziert, Karibu, Namen, Rentiergeweih"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Nach seinen Skizzen fertigten die Architekten Friedrich August Stüler und Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse Entwürfe für ein Gebäude im Stil der italienischen Renaissance. Das Orangerieschloss beherbergt einen Gemäldesaal mit Werkekopien des Renaissancemalers Raffael, ehemalige Gästeappartements und Bedienstetenwohnungen, die zum Teil musealen Zwecken zur Verfügung stehen und Hallen zur Überwinterung der exotischen Kübelpflanzen aus der Parkanlage Sanssouci. Das Orangerieschloss wird von der Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg (SPSG) verwaltet und steht seit 1990 als Weltkulturerbe unter dem Schutz der UNESCO., Das Höhenstraßenprojekt., Der Bau des Orangerieschlosses steht in enger Verbindung mit der Planung einer etwa zwei Kilometer langen Höhenstraße oder auch Triumphstraße, ähnlich einer römischen \\"via triumphalis\\". Sie sollte östlich der Parkanlage Sanssouci, am Triumphtor unterhalb des Mühlenbergs an der heutigen Schopenhauerstraße beginnen, als Serpentine die Höhe des Mühlenbergs erreichen, dann nach Westen durch den Ehrenhof an der Nordseite des Schlosses Sanssouci führen und vorbei an der Historischen Mühle am Belvedere auf dem Klausberg, nordwestlich des Parks, enden. Neben den bereits vorhandenen Gebäuden aus friderizianischer Zeit waren als Neubauten eine Tempelanlage zu Ehren FriedrichsII. auf dem Mühlenberg vorgesehen, beziehungsweise seit etwa 1848 ein Amphitheater, zudem Viadukte zum Ausgleich der Höhenunterschiede, Terrassenanlagen und italienisierende Bauten sowie als architektonischer Höhepunkt das Orangerieschloss auf dem Bornstedter Höhenzug., Schon in der Kronprinzenzeit studierte Friedrich WilhelmIV. Entwürfe italienischer Renaissanceanlagen. Er fand sie unter anderem in den Publikationen \\"Choix des plus célèbres maisons de plaisance de Rome et de ses environs\\" (Auswahl der berühmten Landhäuser von Rom und der Umgebung), Paris 1809, der französischen Architekten Charles Percier und Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, wie auch in dem 1815 in Paris herausgegebenen Stichwerk \\"Architecture Toscane\\" (Architektur der Toscana) von Auguste Henri Victor Grandjean de Montigny und Auguste Pierre Sainte Marie Famin. Auf seiner ersten Italienreise im Jahr 1828 entstanden zahlreiche Zeichnungen und Reiseeindrücke, die den Wunsch erweckten, Sanssouci und die Potsdamer Landschaft mit italienisierenden Bauwerken zu verschönern., Nach der Regierungsübernahme 1840 beschloss er, Sanssouci in tiefer Verbundenheit zu seinem Vorfahren ebenfalls als Sommerresidenz zu nutzen. Damit sie den Bedürfnissen einer königlichen Residenz entsprachen, ließ der König Modernisierungs- und Restaurierungsarbeiten an den Gebäuden durchführen und die Parkanlage mit funktionierenden Fontänenanlagen und neuen Skulpturenkopien ausstatten. Den Auftrag für die architektonische Planung erhielten der Schinkel-Schüler Ludwig Persius und nach dessen Tod 1845 Friedrich August Stüler und Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse. Mit den gartenkünstlerischen Arbeiten wurde der Gartenarchitekt Peter Joseph Lenné betraut. Die Projektarbeiten an der Höhenstraße verzögerten sich zunächst wegen überhöhter Preisforderungen und langwieriger Verhandlungen mit den Eigentümern der Grundstücke auf dem Bornstedter Höhenzug, die sich von 1842 bis 1847 hinzogen. Hinzu kamen politische Unruhen, die 1848 in den Aufständen der Märzrevolution endeten. Fehlende finanzielle Mittel für ein Projekt dieser Größenordnung und die Erkrankung des Königs 1858 ließen das Vorhaben nur in Teilbereichen realisieren. Zur Ausführung kamen neben kleineren Baumaßnahmen das Triumphtor und ein dahinterliegendes Winzerhaus, ein Mühlenhaus an der Historischen Mühle, der Sizilianische und der Nordische Garten und das Orangerieschloss mit Terrassenanlage., Orangerieschloss., Planungsphase., Bei den Bauten entlang der Höhenstraße sollte neben einer repräsentativen Außenwirkung auch die praktische Nutzung einzelner Gebäude berücksichtigt werden. Dazu gehörten vor allem neue Pflanzenhallen für die Überwinterung der zahlreichen im Sommer in den Gartenanlagen aufgestellten Kübelpflanzen; denn die alten Treibhäuser aus friderizianischer Zeit waren nicht mehr zeitgemäß und reparaturbedürftig. Schon in der Kronprinzenzeit beschäftigte sich Friedrich WilhelmIV. bei der Planung des Schlosses Charlottenhof mit dem Bau einer größeren Orangerie, wie eine Zeichnung von 1826 belegt. Das Gebäude auf dem Bornstedter Höhenzug sollte eine Kombination von Pflanzenhalle und Gemäldesaal zur Unterbringung der Raffael-Sammlung seines Vaters Friedrich WilhelmIII. sein. Für die weiteren Räume gab es zunächst keine Nutzungsbestimmung. \\"Eine Vielzahl eigener Skizzen und Zeichnungen nehmen Vorbilder der Villa Pamphili, Villa Madama und Villa Borghese auf.\\" Nach den Vorgaben des Königs fertigte Ludwig Persius ab 1840 erste Entwürfe für ein Gebäude mit klassizistischen Stilelementen. Da die meisten Zeichnungen unsigniert sind, können sie ihm nur anhand seiner Tagebucheintragungen vom 12. Oktober 1840 bis 25. September 1843 in etwa zugeordnet werden. Persius entwarf einen langgestreckten Bau mit Säulenfront und vorgelagertem Podest auf der Südwestseite sowie einen halbkreisförmig nach außen springenden Mittelteil auf der Nordostseite. Eine Doppelturmanlage in der Mitte war von Pflanzenhallen flankiert, an deren Enden sich unterschiedlich gestaltete Flügelbauten anschlossen. Den Baubeginn der Orangerie erlebte Persius nicht mehr. Er starb 1845 noch vor Beginn der Bauarbeiten. Aufgrund von Änderungswünschen des Königs wurde die Außengestaltung später von Stüler und Hesse wieder verworfen., Baugeschichte., Nach Abschluss der Grundstücksverhandlungen ließ Peter Joseph Lenné mit den Erdarbeiten beginnen, deren Leitung Gustav Meyer übernahm. Im Winter 1848/49 wurde das Areal auf dem Höhenzug planiert, ein Wasserbassin auf der Nordostseite des geplanten Gebäudes ausgehoben und der Südhang terrassiert. 1850 erhielt Friedrich August Stüler und unter dessen Leitung Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse den Auftrag zur Projektierung des Orangeriegebäudes. 1851 wurde die sich nach Westen erstreckende Pflanzenhalle errichtet, obwohl wegen der Unentschlossenheit des Königs immer noch kein endgültiger Gesamtplan vorlag. Im Winter 1852/53 konnte die 1854 fertiggestellte Halle bereits zur Überwinterung der Pflanzen genutzt werden. Nachdem sich Friedrich WilhelmIV. für einen Entwurf entschieden hatte, begannen 1853 die Arbeiten am Mittelbau, die 1858 im Außenbereich ihren Abschluss fanden. Zwischen 1854 und 1856 folgten die Baumaßnahmen an der nach Osten angrenzenden Pflanzenhalle. \\"Vorbild für die Doppelturmanlage des Mittelbaus […] war die Villa Medici in Rom, für die Fassadengliederung der Pflanzenhallen mit dem Mezzaningeschoss und den Pavillons sowie den Mitteltrakt war die zum Arno gerichtete Fassade der Uffizien in Florenz.\\" Stüler, der mit den Umbauten am Schweriner Schloss, dem Bau des Neuen Museums in Berlin und weiteren Aufträgen ausgelastet war, folgte mit seinem Entwurf den Skizzen des Königs und überließ die dekorativen Details sowie die Innenraumgestaltung weitgehend Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse., Krankheitsbedingt übergab Friedrich WilhelmIV. die Regentschaft im Oktober 1858 an seinen Bruder Wilhelm und verbrachte den folgenden Winter in Italien, wo er von Malern und Bildhauern weitere Kunstwerke zur Ausgestaltung des Orangerieschlosses erwarb. Für die Zeit seiner Abwesenheit gab er schriftliche Anweisungen zum weiteren Ausbau. Beim Tod des Königs 1861 war der östliche Eckpavillon erst im Rohbau fertiggestellt und der im Westen noch nicht begonnen. Der Bau wurde 1864 unter seinem Nachfolger König WilhelmI. abgeschlossen. Die Fassaden- und Terrassengestaltung mit Bildwerken dauerte noch bis in die 1870er Jahre. Mit einer Gesamtlänge von rund 304 Metern wurde das Orangerieschloss das längste Gebäude in der Parkanlage Sanssouci., Architektur., Mittelbau., Im neuen Entwurf Stülers nach Skizzen Friedrich WilhelmsIV. fand sich die Grundidee der Baukörperanordnung von Persius weitgehend wieder, die jedoch durch Bauelemente aus der Renaissance eine andere Stilrichtung bekam. Der Doppelturmanlage des Mittelbaus wurde auf der Südwestseite ein Säulenhof mit Portalbau vorgelagert, von dessen drei hohen Rundbogenöffnungen die mittlere das Palladiomotiv zeigt. Eine Wiederholung des Motivs findet sich auf der Südwestseite der Doppelturmanlage und auf der Nordostseite an einer mit der Gebäudeflucht abschließenden zweigeschossigen Loggia, der sogenannten Teehalle, wieder. Im Erdgeschoss liegt der über zwei Stockwerke reichende Raffaelsaal, um den sich fünf großzügig ausgestattete Wohnräume gruppieren. Die Türme der Anlage, mit je einem Belvedere im obersten Geschoss und flachen Zeltdächern aus Zinkblech, verbindet eine begehbare Kolonnade. Von hier geht ein weiter Blick nach Süden in den Park Sanssouci, nach Bornstedt im Norden und in die weitere Umgebung. An die Doppelturmanlage und den Portalbau schließen sich zu beiden Seiten dreiachsige Baukuben mit einem Erd- und einem Mezzaningeschoss an. Im südlichen Bereich sind die Erdgeschosse bereits Teil der Pflanzenhallen. Türen in den über zwei Stockwerke reichenden gusseisernen Sprossenfenstern ermöglichen den Zugang vom Säulenhof aus. In den Sprossenfenstern findet sich ebenfalls das Palladiomotiv wieder. In der nördlichen Hälfte des Mittelbaus liegen die Appartements. Den gesamten Mittelbau umgibt eine mit Vasen und Figurenkopien nach antiken Vorbildern aus Zink und Terrakotta geschmückte Dachbalustrade. Die nach 1862 aufgestellten Bildwerke stammen aus der Werkstatt des Bildhauers Ernst March und der Potsdamer Zinkgießerei Friedrich Kahle., Die Gestaltung der Fassaden mit bauplastischem Schmuck erfolgte erst nach dem Tod Friedrich Wilhelms IV. und wurde weitgehend von seinem Bruder WilhelmI. entschieden. In der Südwand der Doppelturmanlage führen drei hohe Türen in das Gebäude. Der mittlere Eingang zum Raffaelsaal wird von zwei Wandaufbauten im Stil einer Ädikula flankiert, in deren Nischen weibliche Figuren stehen.

Sie liegt an der Emsmündung am Nordufer des Dollarts. Mit Einwohnern (Stand ) ist Emden die kleinste der kreisfreien Städte des Bundeslandes, steht auf Platz 21 der Städte in Niedersachsen und ist damit nach Wilhelmshaven die zweitgrößte Stadt an der niedersächsischen Küste. Raumplanerisch ist die Stadt als Mittelzentrum mit Teilfunktionen eines Oberzentrums eingestuft. Die Einwohner heißen \\"Emder,\\" das Adjektiv lautet ebenso., Die Stadt ist als friesischer Handelsort um das Jahr 800 entstanden und bis heute wesentlich durch ihren Seehafen geprägt, der im 20. Jahrhundert die Basis für die Ansiedlung größerer Industriebetriebe wie die Werft Nordseewerke und das Volkswagenwerk war. Als Wirtschaftsstandort hat die einzige kreisfreie Stadt Ostfrieslands für die Region eine überragende Bedeutung. Seit 1973 ist die Stadt Hochschulstandort. Die Landesplanung des Landes Niedersachsen weist Emden seit 2007 als Mittelzentrum mit oberzentralen Teilfunktionen aus., Im 16. Jahrhundert gehörte Emden neben Genf und Wittenberg zu den bedeutendsten Stätten der Reformation. Unter anderem wirkten Johannes a Lasco, Albert Ritzaeus Hardenberg und Menso Alting in Emden. Die Taufe von 300 Erwachsenen in einem Vorraum der Großen Kirche durch Melchior Hofmann 1530 war der Beginn der Täuferbewegung in Nordwestdeutschland und den Niederlanden. Die Große Kirche war während der Reformation zudem religiöser Zufluchtsort für Flüchtlinge aus den Niederlanden. Die Synode von Emden (1571) war die erste Nationalsynode der niederländischen Reformierten. Aufgrund dieser Bedeutung verlieh der Rat der Gemeinschaft Evangelischer Kirchen in Europa (GEKE) mit Sitz in Wien Emden im Dezember 2013 als erstem Ort auf dem Kontinent den Titel „Reformationsstadt Europas“., Bekannt ist Emden zudem als Geburtsort der Komiker Otto Waalkes und Karl Dall, die durch ihr Wirken den Ostfriesenwitz geprägt haben. Insbesondere „Otto“ hat seiner Heimatstadt durch Filme und Musikalben zu größerer Bekanntheit verholfen. Überregionale Bedeutung hat auch die Kunsthalle Emden., Geografie., Geografische Lage., Emden liegt im Nordwesten Deutschlands in der historischen Landschaft Ostfriesland und ist die westlichste Seehafenstadt Deutschlands. Sie befindet sich am nördlichen Rand des Mündungsgebietes der Ems in die Nordsee, südlich der Stadt liegt zudem die Bucht Dollart. Der Emder Hafen liegt 38Seemeilen von der Emsmündung bei Borkum entfernt. An der Knock, die den westlichsten Punkt des Emder Stadtgebietes bildet, befindet sich der südwestlichste Punkt der ostfriesischen Halbinsel., Nahe gelegene größere Städte sind Oldenburg (gut 70 Kilometer ostsüdöstlich), Bremen (gut 110 Kilometer ostsüdöstlich), Groningen (gut 50 Kilometer westsüdwestlich – die Strecke per Bahn oder Auto ist allerdings deutlich länger, da der Dollart umfahren werden muss) sowie Wilhelmshaven (gut 60 Kilometer ostnordöstlich)., Die Landesplanung des Landes Niedersachsen weist Emden als Mittelzentrum mit oberzentralen Teilfunktionen aus. Das Einzugsgebiet variiert je nach der zu beobachtenden Funktion. Als Einkaufsstadt versorgt Emden im Wesentlichen die umliegenden Gemeinden, einige davon nur teilweise, da hier eine Konkurrenz zu den Städten Aurich und Leer besteht. Letztgenannte haben den Vorteil, dass ihr Einzugsgebiet in alle Himmelsrichtungen reicht, während im Süden und im Westen von Emden die Ems und der Dollart die natürliche Grenze des Einzugsgebietes bilden. Ähnliches gilt für weitere Dienstleistungen. Als größte Stadt Ostfrieslands hat Emden trotz seiner (als Einkaufsstadt) ungünstigen Lage dennoch eine wichtige Funktion im Einzelhandel Ostfrieslands., Als Arbeitsort hingegen hat die Stadt eine überragende Bedeutung für die gesamte Region Ostfriesland und teilweise darüber hinaus. Das kulturelle Programm wird – zumindest bei einzelnen Veranstaltungen, etwa manchen Konzerten in der Nordseehalle – von Gästen besucht, die im Umland von Oldenburg, im mittleren bis südlichen Emsland oder im Nordosten der Niederlande wohnen. Zudem ist Emden oft Ziel von Touristen, die ihren Urlaub an der Küste verbringen und sich die kulturellen Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt anschauen., Flächennutzung., Nach umfangreichen Eingemeindungen in den Jahren 1945/46 (Larrelt, Harsweg, Uphusen) sowie 1972 (Twixlum, Wybelsum, Logumer Vorwerk, Widdelswehr, Jarßum, Petkum) machen Landwirtschaftsflächen mittlerweile 52 Prozent des Stadtgebietes aus (s. Tabelle; inzwischen 61,1 Prozent, Stand: 31. Dezember 2014). Damit liegt Emden zwar ziemlich genau im Bundesdurchschnitt, hat für eine kreisfreie Stadt jedoch überdurchschnittlich viel Agrarfläche. Innerhalb Ostfrieslands in seiner Gesamtheit hingegen (Landwirtschaftsflächen von rund 75Prozent) weist Emden einen unterdurchschnittlichen Anteil aus. Der Wasserflächenanteil von 6,85 Prozent (7,7 Prozent, Stand: 31. Dezember 2014) liegt angesichts des Hafens und der Vielzahl an Kanälen deutlich über dem Bundesdurchschnitt von zwei Prozent. Wie alle Kommunen in der Marsch ist Emden hingegen weit unterdurchschnittlich bewaldet (1,24 Prozent, Stand: 31. Dezember 2014). Größtes zusammenhängendes Waldgebiet ist der Emder Wall, ein in den 1990er-Jahren angelegter Stadtwald im äußersten Norden Emdens ist noch im Entstehen begriffen. Bislang sind 71 Hektar mit etwa 450.000 Bäumen bepflanzt worden, zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt sollen die Baum- und Strauchreihen gelichtet werden., Geologie und Böden., Der geologische Untergrund der Stadt wird durch Sedimente aus dem Holozän bestimmt. Emden ist aufgrund seiner Lage an Ems und Dollart eine der wenigen Gemeinden des ostfriesischen Festlands, die keinerlei Anteil an der Geest hat und daher oberflächennah auch keine pleistozänen Schichten aufweist. Die vorherrschende Landschaftsform ist die Marsch., Weite Teile der Stadtfläche im Westen Emdens wurden erst im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert eingedeicht und gelten als sehr fruchtbar. Auch darüber hinaus wurden viele landwirtschaftliche Flächen im Osten wie im Westen der Stadt im 20. Jahrhundert mit Schlick überspült, der bei Ausbaggerungen der Ems und des Emder Hafens gewonnen wurde. Nach Trocknung dieser Flächen erfuhren diese nochmals eine Aufwertung, da der Schlick als wertvoller Bodenbestandteil gilt. Diese Praxis wird auch heute noch fortgesetzt, derzeit (Stand: 2013) im Bereich Wybelsum., Die Marschen Emdens bedecken das gesamte Stadtgebiet mit Ausnahme einiger östlicher Gebiete bei Marienwehr und Uphusen sowie im Borssumer bis Petkumer Hammrich, wo sie in vergesellschafteter Form mit anderen Bodentypen vorkommen. Nordöstlich von Uphusen und südlich des Ems-Jade-Kanals sowie im Borssumer Hammrich findet sich Pseudogley unterlagert von Kleimarsch. Der südliche Teil der Uphuser Gemarkung rund um das Uphuser Meer und das Bansmeer sowie der Petkumer Hammrich (in etwa nördlich des Fehntjer Tiefs) besteht aus Niedermoor mit Rohmarschauflage. Nahe Uphusen sind von 1954 an über mehrere Jahrzehnte Flächen mit Schlick überspült, im Anschluss dräniert und – solchermaßen in der Bodengüte verbessert – wieder einer landwirtschaftlichen Nutzung zugeführt worden. Nordöstlich von Marienwehr, nahe dem Kleinen Meer, findet sich Niedermoor mit Knickmarschauflage. Eine Ausnahme bildet ebenfalls der im frühen 20. Jahrhundert eingepolderte und anschließend künstlich erhöhte östliche Teil des Emder Hafens: Er wird als Gley-Regosol bezeichnet, da bei der Erhöhung des Geländes auf Gley zurückgegriffen wurde., Das restliche Stadtgebiet besteht aus Altmarschen und Jungmarschen. Die jüngsten Marschböden befinden sich im Petkumer Deichvorland, wo Salzwiesen nur noch bei besonders ausgeprägten Sturmfluten überspült werden und ansonsten die Pedogenese (Bodenbildung) bereits eingesetzt hat. Das Areal ist Naturschutzgebiet. Es ist ebenso der Rohmarsch (also der jüngsten Marschform) zuzurechnen wie der in den 1970er-Jahren aufgespülte Rysumer Nacken an der Knock, der 1976 eingemeindet wurde., Ebenfalls zu den Jungmarschen werden Kalkmarsch und Kleimarsch gerechnet, wobei die erstgenannten die bodenkundlich jüngeren sind. Kalkmarschen finden sich in Emden zumeist in jenen Gebieten, die erst in den vergangenen Jahrhunderten eingedeicht wurden. Abgesehen von einem schmalen Streifen Kalkmarsch, der sich von Borssum bis Petkum unmittelbar hinter dem Emsdeich befindet, liegen sämtliche Kalkmarschböden im Westen der Stadt, vor allem im erst zwischen 1912 und 1923 eingedeichten Larrelter und Wybelsumer Polder sowie in dem im späten 19. Jahrhundert dem Dollart abgerungenen Kaiser-Wilhelm-Polder, auf dem die Stadtteile Constantia und Port Arthur/Transvaal entstanden. Darüber hinaus findet sich Kalkmarsch zwischen Larrelt und Twixlum sowie in Verlängerung nördlich des letztgenannten Stadtteils. Die Kleimarsch ist im Emder Stadtgebiet deutlich weniger vertreten, sie tritt im Stadtwesten vor allem als schmaler „Anschlussstreifen“ an die südlicher gelegene Kalkmarsch auf. Der größte zusammenhängende Streifen von Kleimarsch zieht sich in etwa von Petkum über Borssum durch die Innenstadt und folgt von dort dem Hinter Tief nach Norden. Stellenweise ist dieser Streifen jedoch nur kaum mehr als hundert Meter breit., Zu den Altmarschen wird die Knickmarsch gerechnet, die weite Teile des nördlichen und östlichen Stadtgebietes ausmacht – mithin also der Teil der Marsch, die das Reifestadium der Bodenentwicklung darstellt. Die Böden gehören zu den ältesten Marschböden, liegen (wie auch in Emden ersichtlich) am weitesten von der Küste entfernt und sind im Laufe der Bodenbildung abgesunken. In Teilen des Stadtgebietes, etwa bei den Höfen Bartshausen bei Wybelsum und Rote Scheune bei Twixlum, liegt das Areal unter Normalhöhennull. Knickmarsch findet sich zudem in den Meeden nördlich von Larrelt und östlich von Conrebbersweg, im letztgenannten Stadtteil selbst, vor allem aber im gesamten Osten des Stadtgebietes ab einer (in etwa) gedachten Linie Barenburg-Herrentor-Borssum – sofern es sich nicht um jene eingangs erwähnten vergesellschafteten (Misch-)Formen bei Marienwehr sowie im Uphuser, Borssumer und Petk: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Cette hypothèse se base sur l'idée que l'entrepreneuriat féminin peut stimuler la croissance économique d'un pays de plusieurs manières : 1. Création d'emplois : Les femmes entrepreneures peuvent créer de nouveaux emplois, réduisant ainsi le chômage et augmentant le pouvoir d'achat des individus, ce qui contribue à la croissance économique globale. 2. Innovation : Les femmes entrepreneurs peuvent apporter de nouvelles idées et solutions aux problèmes économiques, ce qui peut stimuler l'innovation et favoriser le développement de nouveaux secteurs d'activité. 3. Autonomisation économique des femmes : L'entrepreneuriat féminin peut contribuer à l'autonomisation économique des femmes en leur permettant de créer et de diriger leurs propres entreprises, ce qui peut réduire les inégalités de genre et promouvoir l'inclusion sociale. 4. Augmentation de la productivité : Les femmes entrepreneurs peuvent apporter une nouvelle dynamique dans l'économie en augmentant la productivité, en adoptant de nouvelles technologies et en encourageant une concurrence saine sur le marché. 5. Expansion des marchés : L'entrepreneuriat féminin peut contribuer à l'expansion des marchés en créant des produits et services adaptés aux besoins spécifiques des femmes et en contribuant ainsi à la diversification de l'offre économique. En résumé, l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'entrepreneuriat féminin a une contribution positive à la croissance économique d'un pays est basée sur le potentiel des femmes entrepreneurs à créer des emplois, à stimuler l'innovation, à favoriser l'autonomisation économique des femmes, à augmenter la productivité et à étendre les marchés.
