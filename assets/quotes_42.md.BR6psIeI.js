Problem:Review: I've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to Henry Fool, and even though it technically is, I think that Fay Grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film. Just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first, and I enjoyed that so much about it. The whole point of the film was to change direction from the first, which makes sense because the movie isn't called Henry Fool 2, it's Fay Grim. All that aside, the film, I thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me. I was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line (aka parker's last direct to video feature the Oh in Ohio) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so, which I absolutely loved. There are so many nuances in the film making and writing that I crave to see in films, but never do. The cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'Grim' throughout - in terms of setting. The writing was so well put together as well, whoever said this movie isn't as witty as Henry Fool needs to watch again and actually listen; I almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was, and pertinent. And well, Parker Posey, who could complain? The scene in which Fool and Jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. And I thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on (in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost). The main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film, and i believe the point of the film, was Parker's love and naivety about Fool, which was so endearing and turned, yes very quickly, from denial to outright passion. The last five minutes of the film were perfect. Obviously there were things that weren't excellent, but nothing is perfect; some of the acting was poor, and at times I did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand, but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension. (This may also have to do with Goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast) On the whole I would say that it was probably one of the best films I've seen this year; stylistically pleasing, clever and witty writing, performances that were so impressive I now have gained new respect for some of the actors, and a truly touching film, and don't forget, a complete departure from Fool.

Movie plot title: Harakiri Movie plot: Edo, 1630. Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome. Despite HanshirÅ's pleas, his Lord forbade him to kill himself. In order to... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Ii clan should uphold the code of Bushido, also known as the Samurai code. This code encompasses a set of moral principles and values that were meant to guide the behavior of samurai warriors in feudal Japan. The principles of Bushido include loyalty, honor, integrity, courage, compassion, and self-discipline. In the movie plot of Harakiri, the Ii clan is shown to have failed in upholding these principles. They forced Chijiiwa Motome, a rōnin, to commit seppuku with a bamboo blade, causing a slow, painful, and humiliating death. Their actions demonstrate a lack of compassion and understanding of the difficulties faced by many samurai in the period of instability. By adhering to the Bushido code, the Ii clan should have exercised good judgment in understanding Motome's circumstances, as well as demonstrating compassion towards the displaced samurai people. The clan should also have defended their honor by treating their fellow samurai with respect and dignity. In revealing his association with Motome, Tsugumo Hanshirō exposes the Ii clan's disregard for the Bushido code, illustrating that their actions were not aligned with the historically-accepted principles of samurai culture. As a result, the Ii clan should prioritize restoring their adherence to the Bushido code and rectifying the injustices they have committed against those who sought their assistance. This includes treating the rōnin and other samurai with compassion and understanding and honoring their traditions and the sacrifices they have made as protectors of their people."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They go to great lengths to keep their affair a secret, but Ned carelessly propositions an old school friend of Matty, Mary Ann Simpson (Kim Zimmer), thinking she was Matty. Matty soon makes it clear to Ned that she wants to leave Edmund but also wants his money, explaining that a divorce would leave her with very little due to their prenuptial agreement. Racine suggests the only option is to kill Edmund. While planning the murder, Ned consults one of his shadier clients, Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke), an expert on incendiary devices, who supplies him with a bomb. Racine drives to the Walker estate at night to kill Edmund. He places the body in an abandoned building in which Edmund had a business interest, and uses the incendiary device to make it look like he died during a botched arson job. Ned is contacted by Edmund's lawyer about a new will that Racine supposedly drew up on Edmund's behalf, which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson. The new will is so poorly prepared it is declared null and void, resulting in Matty inheriting the entire fortune. Matty later admits to Ned that she forged the will.

Q: Peptide based-vaccines are becoming one of the most widely investigated prophylactic and therapeutic health care interventions against a variety of diseases, including cancer. However, the lack of a safe and highly efficient adjuvant (immune stimulant) is regarded as the biggest obstacle to vaccine development. The incorporation of a peptide antigen in a nanostructure-based delivery system was recently shown to overcome this obstacle. Nanostructures are often formed from antigens conjugated to molecules such as polymers, lipids, and peptide, with the help of selfassembly phenomenon. This review describes the application of self-assembly process for the production of peptide-based vaccine candidates and the ability of these nanostructures to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses. T stimulate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to eliminate cells that are already infected [8] [9] [10] . Therapeutic vaccines are a growing pharmaceutical sector. Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for prostate cancer [11, 12] and talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (Imlygic™) was introduced against metastatic melanoma in 2015 [13] [14] [15] . Despite their advantages, vaccines also have some drawbacks. Traditional vaccines based on attenuated and inactivated pathogens may revert to virulent form [16, 17] , cause autoimmunity or strong allergic responses [18, 19] . Additionally, the production and stability of this type of vaccine is often challenging. Subunit vaccines contain a small fragment of the whole pathogenic organism, for instance a recombinant protein, peptide, carbohydrate [20] [21] [22] [23] . Recombinant protein-based vaccines cause fewer adverse effects, but the difficulty with protein extraction and possible contamination during production are significant disadvantages. Recombinant vaccine can also trigger undesired immune responses. To avoid these obstacles minimal fragment of protein caring immunological information (peptide epitope) can be used for vaccine design [3] . However, peptide-based vaccines still have their own Achilles' heel. Peptides themselves are usually not immunogenic [3, 24] ; therefore, the use of immunostimulating agents (adjuvants) are essential for the success of this vaccine formulation [25] . Adjuvants are compounds that are able to evoke or enhance the immune response against co-delivered antigens [26] [27] [28] . A number of adjuvants have already been developed, for example Freund's adjuvant, lipid A, cholera toxin, aluminum salts, cytokines, liposomes, saponins, and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides [29] [30] [31] . However, the immunostimulating properties of these adjuvants are often poor or their toxicity is significant, therefore most of them are not suitable for human treatment. Thus, safer and more efficient adjuvants are urgently required [27] . Nanotechnology is one of the most quickly growing fields of science and engineering. It has been widely applied in materials, electronics, manufacturing, agricultural science, chemistry and bioscience [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In bioscience, nanotechnology is used to create sensors, medical imaging and diagnostic tools, and for drug delivery. The most widely used nanostructures in this field are nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are often defined as particles with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 nm [24, 38] , while particles with diameter within the range of 100 to 1000 nm are considered sub-micro particles. However, following common understanding of \\"nano-size\\" range, nanostructures in this article are defined as any nanometer-sized object ranging from 1 to 1000 nm [39, 40] . Nanoparticles are especially useful in vaccine design. Many pathogens are within the nanometer range, nanoparticles are usually taken up efficiently by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [41] . APCs are the key element of the primary innate immune system [42] and are responsible for triggering further adaptive immune responses. Therefore nanostructures often have immunostimulating properties and help to trigger immune reactions against the antigens they delivered (Fig. 1) [24, 43, 44] . Moreover, the surface of nanostructures can be modified with a specific targeting moiety for better APC recognition and uptake [45] [46] [47] . There are two main approaches to creating nanostructures: (1) mechanically breaking a large material into nanostructures, or (2) building up nanostructures from basic segments, often via a self-assembly process [48] . The first approach uses external forces like grinding, milling, or high pressure to break down the original material [49] [50] [51] . This process adds additional complexity to producing a nanostructure and the harsh conditions used to break down the initial component may damage the antigen. Nanostructures produced by this method typically have a low loading capacity and are often not biodegradable and thus may accumulate in the human tissues. Meanwhile, self-assembly-based strategies for production of nanoparticle vaccines can overcome these problems. Here, we highlight how the use of carrier-antigen conjugates forming self-assembling nanostructures can be effectively combined with the rational vaccine design. The formation of self-assembled nanoparticles from carrier-antigen (peptide epitopes) conjugates, and their ability to generate humoral/cellular immune responses are discussed (Fig. 1) . Extensive reviews on non-conjugated selfassembled antigen carrier, such as liposomes, can be found in the recent literature [52] [53] [54] [55] . Similarly, virus-like particles (VLPs), which are formed by self-assembly processes, have been reviewed extensively in the recent literature [56-58] and therefore are Fig. 1.

Gloves and eye protection and it cut small trees like butter- I am a 120 lb. woman (single mom) and had a blast with it! Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy- but don't get this! It was very disappointing and if I can handle the 16 amp, being a slender unused to power tools mom, which is about 15.00 more buy that!

The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the French Revolution of 1789. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the \\"consent of the governed\\" philosophy as delineated by Locke in Two Treatises of Government (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the \\"divine right of kings\\". In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully, and therefore violent revolution was the result. Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government.

When efforts to reconcile these conflicting ideas through peaceful means failed, it resulted in violent revolutions, such as the French Revolution of 1789, as people sought to establish a new system of governance based on Enlightenment principles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - garage - big house - movie - restaurant - tuxedo Explain why a human would choose \\"big house\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"big house\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most relevant and logical option among the given choices. Here's a breakdown of why other options are less suitable: 1. Garage: Although a gentleman might own a garage, it's not the primary structure or property they would typically reside in or go inside of regularly. A garage is more suitable for parking vehicles or storing items, which makes it a less fitting choice for this question. 2. Movie: A gentleman might go to watch a movie, but they do not own a movie as a tangible property. A movie is a form of media entertainment, which doesn't provide a space in which a person can physically go inside. 3. Restaurant: While a gentleman might go inside and even own a restaurant, this option is less likely than \\"big house\\" because the possession of a restaurant by an individual is rather uncommon and typically linked to a professional business activity rather than personal living arrangements. 4. Tuxedo: A gentleman might own a tuxedo and wear it, but they don't physically go inside of it. A tuxedo is a piece of clothing, and although a person can wear it, it doesn't envelop or encompass them in the same way a house does. Given these explanations, a human would choose \\"big house\\" as the most logical answer to the question. A gentleman might own a big house, and it is this kind of property where they would reside and go inside of on a regular basis. A big house also usually implies a degree of wealth and success, which might be associated with the term \\"gentleman.\\" Additionally, a house is a fundamental type of personal property; it not only provides shelter and comfort but also serves as a gathering place for family and friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\"? , can you please find it? Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for Esquire, Gary Giddins hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional polyphony and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and \\"let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center\\". Giddins also highlighted the melody of \\"Sleep Talk\\", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the Detroit Metro Times wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record \\"a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness\\". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in African-American music over the previous century. Robert Christgau called its \\"warm, listenable harmolodic funk\\" an artistic \\"breakthrough if not a miracle\\". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in The Village Voice, \\"the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian.\\"Purist critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In Stereo Review, Chris Albertson deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the Los Angeles Times believed the album's supporters in \\"hip rock circles\\" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique \\"beacon of clarity\\" amid an incessant background.

About 50,000 Iraqi security forces personnel, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen are involved in the offensive, which began more than two weeks ago, to drive IS militants out of their last major urban stronghold in the country.

Please answer the following question: This article: In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert... contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who travelled extensively in Europe?, what is it ?

If \\"A skateboarder is jumping from a ramp.\\", does this mean that \\"A skateboarder is in the middle of his jump routine on the ramp.\\"?","completion":"Not necessarily. The statement, \\"A skateboarder is jumping from a ramp,\\" describes a specific moment or action within a skateboarder's performance. It implies that the skateboarder has successfully launched themselves into the air after riding up the ramp, and they are now in mid-air after having left the ramp's surface. On the other hand, the statement \\"A skateboarder is in the middle of his jump routine on the ramp,\\" suggests a broader context for the skateboarder's performance. It indicates that the skateboarder is currently engaged in a series of jumps or maneuvers that are part of a larger routine, which is taking place on the ramp. This could include various tricks, combinations, or moves that the skateboarder performs while using the ramp's features to gain height, speed, and momentum. While it is possible that the former statement could fit within the context of the latter, they are not precisely the same thing. The first statement describes a single action, while the second statement describes an ongoing series of actions. The skateboarder jumping from the ramp could be one of the actions that occur in the middle of the skateboarder's jump routine on the ramp. However, without more information, it is not possible to definitively say that the skateboarder launching from the ramp is in the middle of his jump routine. The skateboarder might have just started their routine or could be at the end of their performance. The first statement could also be an isolated event where the skateboarder is not performing a full routine, but simply using the ramp to showcase that single jump. In conclusion, while the two statements might be related to a certain extent, they are not the same thing. The first statement focuses on a specific action, and the second statement provides a broader context for the skateboarder's performance on the ramp. To connect the two ideas, more information would be needed about the skateboarder's actions and intentions during their time on the ramp."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Knowing that \\"as dryness increases in an environment , the available water in that environment will decrease\\", how would one answer \\"as dryness increases in an environment, biodiversity\\"","completion":"As dryness increases in an environment, biodiversity will generally decline. Biodiversity is the variety of life at all levels of biological organization, including the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. It is crucial for the health and resilience of ecosystems to disturbances and contributes greatly to the overall productivity and stability of ecosystems. There are several reasons why increased dryness may lead to decreased biodiversity including factors such as resource availability, physiological stress, and ecosystem shifts. 1. Resource Availability: Water is a fundamental resource for all living organisms. As dryness increases, the availability of water decreases, thereby limiting the overall abundance and distribution of plant and animal species. Water availability can dictate primary productivity and directly influence the abundance of primary consumers (e.g., herbivores) and higher trophic levels like predators and decomposers. This decreased availability of food resources for wildlife species can reduce biodiversity in these communities. 2. Physiological Stress: Increased dryness can cause physiological stress on plants and animals that are not well-adapted to these conditions. For plants, this could mean reduced photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction rates as they struggle to maintain internal water balance and acquire water from the soil. Many animals also rely on certain levels of environmental moisture to survive and reproduce, so an increase in dryness can diminish their overall fitness. Species that cannot tolerate this stress may decline in populations or even become extinct, which in turn would reduce biodiversity. 3. Ecosystem Shifts: Increased dryness can lead to shifts in ecosystems: it can convert a region from a wetland into a grassland, or a forest to a desert or savanna. These ecosystem transitions can have cascading effects on the composition of plant and animal species in an area. For instance, the transition from a forest to a savanna due to increased dryness can result in a decline or loss of tree-dwelling species, a decrease in forest-dwelling herbivores, and a loss of habitat for many other species dependent on forest structures. This ecosystem shift can be particularly pronounced if there is a sudden or irreversible change in environmental conditions, effectively forcing whole ecosystems to collapse or transition to a different state, with biodiversity decreasing as a consequence. 4. Species Interactions and Keystone Species: Dryness also affects the interactions between species within an ecosystem. For example, an increase in dryness may limit pollinator services, as reduced water availability can affect the distribution and abundance of pollinator species, leading to plant species decline. Additionally, if a particular species is sensitive to dryness, it may experience rapid population decline or extinction, disrupting its role within the ecosystem. This could specifically result in the loss of a keystone species - a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance - leading to a cascading effect on the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. 5. Increased Competition: With a decrease in resource availability, the competition for limited resources will increase among the species that persist in the environment. This increased competition can potentially lead to the exclusion of some species from their habitats and exacerbate the decline in overall biodiversity. In conclusion, increased dryness in an environment typically leads to decreased biodiversity, as species face challenges adapting and coping with resource limitations, physiological stress, and changes within their ecosystems. This decline in biodiversity further impacts ecosystem functioning and resilience, affecting a multitude of ecological processes and other environmental systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores. Question: suppose more mold forms into a colony happens, how will it affect more Sporangiophores grow upward. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More effect. To address this question, let's first understand the process of mold growth and the role of sporangiophores in this process. Mold, a type of fungi, reproduces through the release of spores, which are microscopic structures containing the genetic material required for new mold growth. When a mold spore encounters a suitable environment, such as the surface of a piece of bread with sufficient moisture and nutrients, it germinates and begins to grow hyphae. These hyphae penetrate the bread, allowing the mold to absorb nutrients and continue growing. As mold growth progresses, additional spores may land on the bread and begin germinating, leading to the formation of a mold colony. This colony, consisting of many interconnected hyphae networks, may contain several different types of molds. Each mold type produces specific structures known as sporangiophores, which grow upward from the main body of the mold. The main function of sporangiophores is to produce and release new spores into the environment, further facilitating the spread and growth of mold. Now, let's consider the scenario where more mold forms into a colony. This essentially implies an increase in the number of mold spores that have germinated and grown hyphae, leading to the expansion of the overall mold colony. With more mold present, there is a greater demand for sporangiophores to reproduce and disperse new spores. This increased demand will drive the mold colony to produce more sporangiophores, ultimately resulting in a higher overall rate of upward sporangiophore growth. The perturbation mentioned in the question essentially refers to the increased mold growth within the colony. This perturbation will have a direct influence on the number of sporangiophores that grow upward. The more mold growth that occurs within the colony, whether through the germination of new spores or the expansion of existing hyphae networks, the greater the need for sporangiophores to facilitate reproduction and spore dispersal. Consequently, the increased mold growth will have a more significant effect on the growth of the sporangiophores. In summary, the presence of more mold forming into a colony will have a more substantial effect on the growth of sporangiophores. This is because the increased mold growth within the colony demands the production of additional sporangiophores to accommodate the need for reproduction and spore dispersal. This, in turn, leads to a more significant increase in the rate of upward sporangiophore growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Sumer.","completion":"What were the key factors that contributed to the development and success of the Sumerian civilization? Located in modern-day southern Iraq, Sumer was one of the earliest cradles of civilization, dating back to around 4500 BCE. A collection of powerful city-states, it boasted immense cultural, technological, and economic advancements. The key factors that contributed to the growth and success of the Sumerian civilization can be seen through its geography, agricultural advancements, societal organization, trade networks, and technological innovations. 1. Geography: Sumer was situated in the fertile crescent area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This surrounding environment provided the civilization with essential resources for agriculture and socioeconomic development. Sumer's location allowed easy access to water for irrigating crops, and it also was benefited from the mineral-rich alluvial soil brought by floods. 2. Agricultural advancements: The development of advanced agricultural techniques allowed the Sumerians to take full advantage of the fertile surroundings. They constructed extensive irrigation systems using canals and dikes to manage water distribution effectively. By regulating the water supply, they were able to grow an abundance of crops like barley, wheat, dates, melons, and several other fruits and vegetables. The stable food supply facilitated population growth and enabled the people to focus on other aspects of societal development. 3. Societal organization: The creation of a complex and efficient societal structure was vital to the success of the Sumerian civilization. Over time, the Sumerians developed a hierarchical society, which included rulers, scribes, priests, merchants, farmers, and slaves. This social structure created a sense of order and stability, which facilitated effective governance and efficient distribution of labor. The Sumerians were also pioneers in the creation of the first known system of writing, cuneiform, which laid the foundation for record-keeping, law, and administration. 4. Trade networks: Sumer's thriving agriculture led to a surplus of food and other resources. These surpluses allowed for the growth of extensive trade networks with neighboring regions, such as Anatolia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley. The Sumerians were skilled artisans, producing many exquisitely-crafted goods, including pottery, textiles, weapons, and jewelry, which were exchanged for valuable materials such as timber, stone, and metals not available in their region. The trade system eventually developed into a complex economic network, further fueling Sumer's prosperity. 5. Technological innovations: The Sumerians were pioneers of various groundbreaking technologies that facilitated the progress and success of the civilization. Some of their most transformative inventions included the wheel, the plow, the sailboat, and the development of the first known system of writing, cuneiform. These innovations allowed the Sumerians to streamline agriculture, improve transportation, maintain records, and communicate with neighboring regions more efficiently. In conclusion, the success of the Sumerian civilization was built upon a combination of advantageous geography, advanced agriculture, complex societal organization, extensive trade networks, and technological innovations. These factors collectively allowed the Sumerians to not only sustain their civilization but also to make lasting impacts on human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Now, I have a new situation: Greg is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health. Answer this question please: Which patient would more likely risk cardiovascular disease, patient A or patient B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, Patient A, who maintains a high-fat diet, would more likely be at risk for cardiovascular disease compared to Patient B, who does not maintain a high-fat diet. This is because a diet high in lipids, particularly saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol, can lead to an increase in blood lipid levels, potentially resulting in health problems such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

Question: Why were scientific academies considered more valuable than universities? Context: Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.

Prepare a cash flow statement: A cash flow statement lists all the inflows (money coming in) and outflows (money going out) during a specific period.

Monitor your bank account regularly: As you mentioned, check your business's bank account at the beginning of each month to know how much cash you have on hand. This helps you plan your expenses and avoid any unexpected cash shortfalls. 3. Create a cash flow forecast: Estimate your business's future inflows and outflows based on historical data and expected changes in the market, customer base, or expenses. A cash flow forecast allows you to anticipate cash shortages and helps in making informed financial decisions. 4. Collect receivables promptly: Encourage your customers to pay you as soon as possible by offering discounts for early payments or by setting up recurring billing options. 5. Control spending: Review your expenses carefully and prioritize essential ones. Eliminate unnecessary expenses and negotiate better terms with vendors to improve cash flow. 6. Maintain an emergency fund: Set aside some cash reserves for unforeseen situations. Having an emergency fund can be a lifeline during difficult times. 7. Adjust payment terms: You can also improve cash flow management by reassessing your payment terms with clients or vendors. Aim for shorter payment terms when billing your clients, and negotiate longer payment terms with your suppliers.

It is composed of 13 districts (hence the 13 stars on the flag) and its capital is Sion. - Roman Agaunum, the modern Saint-Maurice in the canton Valais in southwesternmost Switzerland, was a minor post confined between the Rhône and the mountains along the well-travelled road that led from Roman Genava, modern Geneva, over the Alps by the Great St. Bernard Pass to Italy. - Saluzzo is a town and former principality in the province of Cuneo, Piedmont region, Italy. - Saint Chiaffredo ( Chiaffredus , Theofredus , Ciafrè , Chaffre , Teofredo , Jafredo , Jafredus , Eufredus , Jofredus , Sinfredus , Zaffredus ) is venerated as the patron saint of Saluzzo , Italy . Tradition considers him a member of the Theban Legion , but instead of being martyred with this legion at Agaunum ( in present - day Switzerland ) , he escaped to Piedmont and was martyred there . A 14th - century account relates that , around 522 , a man fell from a precipice near Crissolo but remained unharmed . The local population attributed his being unharmed to relics discovered by a peasant plowing in the vicinity - a discovery attributed to divine intervention . The mysterious skeleton was given the name of \`\` San Ciafrè '' and the tomb became the focus of a celebrated sanctuary at Crissolo . The first documentary evidence pointing to a cult devoted to Chiaffredo dates from 1387 , when Avignon Pope Clement VII granted indulgences to those who visited the church at Crissolo and helped in its repair . A late 16th century legend written down by Guglielmo Baldesano states that Chiaffredo or Teofredo , soldier of the Theban Legion , escaped to Piedmont to avoid sacrificing to pagan idols and was martyred at Crissolo around 270 . Fabio Arduino believes this story to have no historical foundation , as it would have been unlikely for a Roman legionary of the 3rd century to bear such a clearly Germanic name . The name is a variant of Theudofridus , derived from the Germanic theuda - \`\` people , '' and frithu - \`\` peace .

His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916.

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism.

An activist monk detained by Myanmar authorities Friday was freed hours later after being questioned at a military base in Yangon, a fellow monk said Saturday. U Gambira was taken away from a monastery in Yangon by about 10 men in plainclothes who said they were from the \\"Yangon Division,\\" said U Thika, a monk who witnessed the events. His detainment occurred only weeks after he was released from years of imprisonment. He was released again Friday night after being questioned at the military headquarters in Yangon about his personal and family information, according to Ashin Issariya, another monk at the Yangon monastery. The detention of U Gambira comes after the Myanmar government has taken notable steps to improve its human rights record. In recent weeks, the regime has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, approved the participation of the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in April elections, and pledged to pursue a peace deal with an ethnic rebel group. Western governments have applauded the effort, with the United States announcing in January that it would exchange ambassadors with Myanmar for the first time since 1988. That came after a visit to the country last month by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the first top U.S. diplomat in the nation in more than five decades. U Gambira was one of the leaders of anti-government demonstrations that rallied tens of thousands of people in 2007. The Myanmar authorities cracked down on the demonstrations, clubbing and gassing protesters and arresting as many as 200 monks. He was released last month with other political prisoners. U Thika said he believed the reason U Gambira had been taken away Friday may be related to a recent effort by U Gambira to break into his old monastery, which was locked after the 2007 protests.

Options: a. 25 / 3, b. 19 / 3, c. 20 / 3, d. 25 / 3, e. 22 / 3 A:","completion":"Step 1: Determine the amount of work done by one person in one day. Since 5 people can write 25 books in 20 days working 8 hours a day, then each person works for 20 x 8 = 160 hours. The work done by one person in these 160 hours is writing 25 books with the 5 people. So, one person can write 25/5 = 5 books in 160 hours. Step 2: Determine the amount of work done by one person in one hour. Since one person can write 5 books in 160 hours, then one person writes 5/160 = 1/32 books per hour. Step 3: Determine the amount of work done by 75 people in one hour. If one person writes 1/32 books per hour, then 75 people can write (1/32) * 75 = 75/32 books per hour. Step 4: Calculate the number of hours required to write 125 books by 75 people at the current work rate. We need to find the number of hours (h) required for 75 people to write 125 books, considering that they write 75/32 books per hour. To do this, we set up the equation: (75/32) * h = 125. Step 5: Solve the equation to find the number of hours. To solve for h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 75/32, which is 32/75. This gives us: h = (32/75) * 125 h = (32 * 125) / 75 h = 4000 / 75 h = 53.33 hours (approximately) Step 6: Convert hours to days. Since the 75 people work for 8 hours per day, we divide the total hours by 8 to determine the number of days. 53.33 hours / 8 hours per day = 6.67 days (approximately) There is no exact answer choice that matches our calculated value, so we'll choose the closest option available.

A more recent addition to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that the first player to use a protective visor Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, and Under Armour, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon (who needed the visor because of a childhood eye injury). While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes in the case of a serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty. See options at the end.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die. Question: suppose we find a way to live longer happens, how will it affect MORE babies. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"Suppose we find a way to live longer, there would likely be a complex set of consequences on the number of babies born, meaning that answer A \\"more\\" may be just one potential outcome of the scenario. However, it is essential to look at various factors that may come into play if humans have the ability to increase their lifespan significantly. 1. Life extension and fertility rates: If the life extension method also addresses age-related fertility decline, people might choose to have children later in life and perhaps more frequently than they do currently. This could lead to an increase in the number of babies born (A: more). However, if fertility rates remain unchanged, and people retain the same reproductive window, there may not be a direct impact on the number of babies born, aligning with option C \\"no effect.\\" 2. Social, economic, and cultural factors: An increased lifespan will likely bring about several social, economic, and cultural changes that may affect the number of babies born. For instance, longer life might lead to extended education, career length, and delayed decision-making regarding starting a family. This could potentially result in more babies being born over a person's lifespan (A: more). However, it could also lead to individuals choosing to have fewer children due to the increased focus on their career, education, or personal life (B: less). Furthermore, social and cultural changes may affect people's attitudes toward family size, shifting the balance of preference between more or less babies. 3. Population and environmental concerns: With longer lifespans, the overall global population could increase, putting more pressure on resources like food, water, and housing. Such concerns might lead to the implementation of government policies aimed at controlling population growth. Under these circumstances, the number of babies born might decrease (B: less). Individuals might also become more aware of the environmental and ecological impact of overpopulation and opt to have fewer or no children. 4. Technological advancements and healthcare improvements: In a world where humans can live significantly longer, it's possible that medical and technological advancements will also improve healthcare for children, reducing infant mortality rates and enabling healthier babies. This may result in more babies being born, as more families feel confident in their children's survival (A: more). On the other hand, improved healthcare and technology may also lead to the development of more effective birth control methods, allowing individuals to better plan when they want to have children and how many they'd like to have. This factor could result in an increase or decrease in the number of babies born, depending on individual preferences (A: more, B: less, or C: no effect). In conclusion, the effect of an extended human lifespan on the number of babies being born is not a simple answer and would likely depend on several intertwining factors including fertility rates, social and economic changes, potential population control measures, and technological advancements in healthcare. Depending on these factors, the number of babies born could increase (A: more), decrease (B: less), or remain unchanged (C: no effect) if humans were to find a way to live longer."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Article: The revelation that women leaving a west London prison were given tents instead of housing has been described as \\"staggering\\" by Government ministers and raised alarm among housing charity groups. A prison watchdog revealed sleeping bags had also been handed out to a number of ex-offenders from HMP Bronzefield amid a shortage of available housing. Shadow Prisons Minister Jo Stevens said in response to the report: \\"It is absolutely staggering that women seem to have been released from prison with nothing more than a tent or a sleeping bag. ”This is astonishing and a far cry from the safe and secure accommodation needed to assist them in the rehabilitation process.“ Housing charity Women in Prison said the report, which was undertaken following an unannounced inspection, was \\"concerning\\" but \\"sadly not surprising\\" in the current housing climate. A spokesperson from Women in Prison said: “The fact that Bronzefield is resorting to issuing tents to women leaving prison with nowhere to live does not highlight a problem evident within that one prison. “Instead it is a reflection of how chronic the housing crisis has become and it urgently must bring awareness to the staggering high numbers of women that are leaving prison homeless across the women’s estate and the devastating impact this then has on those women and our communities.\\" The number of women who left Bronzefield prison with settled accommodation in place had dropped from 95.5 per cent in 2014 to just 83.7 per cent in 2015, according to the report from HM Inspectorate of Prisons. It was also noted that in the six-month period leading up to the inspection, 103 women had been released with no fixed address to go to. The Housing for Women association also said the report was “concerning”. A spokesperson said: “We believe that preparation for release should start as early as possible before release in order to adequately plan and effectively link women into support networks in their ‘home‘ community including; making links with family and friends and clearly identifying accommodation options for them, linking them into additional support services as appropriate. \\"Without this planned approach and as widely documented – women are at significant risk of breaching their licences and/or reoffending.” HMP Bronzefield blamed the lack of social housing available in the south east as a contributory factor, and local authority housing departments’ downgrading of ex-offenders to “low priority” cases. “The prison had issued tents to two women who were released without anywhere to go to and the chaplaincy often gave out sleeping bags,” it said. “The community chaplain, however, was preparing a network of contacts in faith communities so that women could be placed in accommodation with them and receive support on release.” Martin Lomas, HM Deputy Chief Inspector of Prisons, who signed off the report, said: “HMP Bronzefield was a very good and improved prison… The general environment was good and care was taken to keep the prison decent.\\" According to the report, many of the inmates at Bronzefield may be seen as vulnerable. Around one third of the women reported having a disability and 44 per cent said they felt depressed or suicidal. The figures raise concern over the amount of support available to ex-offenders undergoing rehabilitation. HMP Bronzefield is a high-security prison for restricted status women. It holds up to 527 inmates at any one time, between the ages of 18 and 70. The prison's director, Charlotte Pattison-Rideout, said: ”We work with local authorities and other organisations to ensure as many women as possible have suitable accommodation upon release from HMP Bronzefield, but it's an area where there's a shortfall that affects the whole of the prison estate. “There has been a change in process at the local authority following the Localism Act which has been a factor in more women, unfortunately, leaving without immediate housing. ”We are building links with the local community rehabilitation company who are now responsible for housing to ensure more women have support and accommodation upon release.“ The Shadow Prisons Minister said: “The improvement noted in this report is welcome but there remain very serious questions to be answered.“ ||||| Data crawled on behalf of Internet Memory Foundation .

In his first annual report, Peter Clarke said the \\"grim situation\\" revealed in last year's report was now \\"even worse\\" is some areas. Reforms have been jeopardised by legal highs among inmates, he added. New Justice Secretary Liz Truss said she was under \\"no illusions\\" about the scale of the challenge to bring reform. Last year, the outgoing inspector said prisons were in their worst state for 10 years. 'Unpalatable truth' Mr Clarke - who was appointed as chief inspector of prisons in January - said in some key areas the situation had got even worse since then. We have an ambitious agenda to modernise the prison estate, improve education and empower governors, so that we can tackle issues like drugs and violence Liz Truss, Justice secretary He said there was \\"a simple and unpalatable truth about far too many of our prisons\\", adding: \\"They have become unacceptably violent and dangerous places\\". Last year, there were more than 20,000 assaults - 27% up on the previous year - with six homicides in the 12 months to April 2016. Incidents of self-harm rose by a quarter in 2015 to more than 32,000. Mr Clarke said a large part of the violence was linked to the harm caused by new psychoactive substances, often referred to as legal highs, which were having a \\"dramatic and destabilising effect\\". The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman identified 39 prison deaths linked to the use of legal highs between June 2013 and June 2015. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Justice Secretary Liz Truss said prison reforms would \\"continue at pace\\" However, Mr Clarke said there was still \\"no national strategy\\" for dealing with the problem of legal highs in prisons. He said he had met prisoners who had \\"self-segregated\\" in order to escape the violence caused by legal highs. While some aspects of the problem with legal highs were being addressed by criminalising possession and better use of technology to test for the drugs, it wasn't enough, he added. \\"A very clear strategy is required to deal with this threat to our prisons,\\" he said. 'Ambitious agenda' Ms Truss said she wanted to see \\"radical reform\\" but was under \\"no illusions about the scale of the challenge we face or how long reform takes\\". She was appointed as the justice minister last week - replacing Michael Gove, who had announced a series of reforms for prisons. She said: \\"We have an ambitious agenda to modernise the prison estate, improve education and empower governors, so that we can tackle issues like drugs and violence which are key to cutting reoffending and keeping staff and prisoners safe.\\" Ms Truss said the report showed \\"why prison reform is so important\\", adding that she would \\"set out the next steps for this agenda in coming weeks\\". ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Women leaving HMP Bronzefield, a women's prison in West London, have been given tents and sleeping bags due to a lack of housing, according to a report by a prison watchdog.

Burges later designed the Council Chamber, added in 1867, and in 1881 began work on Connaught Hall in Dover, a town meeting and concert hall. The new building contained meeting rooms and mayoral and official offices. Although Burges designed the project, most of it was completed after his death by his partners, Pullan and Chapple.

Title: Superbly done and highly entertaining Review: This film about a bank robber being pursued by the mob for monies that he unwittingly stole from them is one of the best pictures of the crime-chase genre that I have ever seen. Not only is the pace and suspense admirably sustained by the much underrated action film director Don Siegal, and moreover, with mordantly witty (almost Hitchcockian) touches throughout, but the characters all come across as highly distinctive, even idiosyncratic, instead of generic types (as is often the case in such films). Matthau shines in an effectively low key portrayal as the unassuming but ultimately crafty and resourceful crop duster pilot/bank robber, Charley Varrick, as does Joe Don Baker, who uses his hulking presence to come across as genuinely fearsome as the hit man, Molly (how do you like that as a choice of name for a villain?).

He grew a beard; he shaved. He gained weight; he dieted. Plastic surgery reconfigured his looks. Fearful that the Islamic terrorists he helped put behind bars wanted him dead, Salem carried concealed firearms and wore Kevlar vests. He kept a packed suitcase, ready to bolt into another life in another town. In the car, he kept a nervous eye on the rearview mirror and paused before turning the ignition, scared that the car might explode. Once late at night, he says, he mistook his son for an intruder and nearly shot him. Two decades have passed since Salem went deep undercover for the FBI and infiltrated the terrorist cell behind the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. After the explosion, he helped the FBI bring charges against a related group of terrorists for a separate plot to blow up tunnels and bridges and other New York landmarks.

Salem was an undercover informant while serving as head of security for Abdel Rahman. (Daniel Hulshizer / Associated Press) See more galleries In that case, for 46 days in 1995, he testified as the government's star witness in a federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. Then Salem disappeared. He and his wife slipped away into a world of hiding — a lonely, stressful life, separated from old friends — and raised a son and a daughter who could not understand the dangers around them. The family bounced from state to state in the federal witness protection program. Now at 64, with no job, no home equity and no pension, Salem decided to talk about his past. He's hoping to recapture a splash of the old fame, notoriety and sense of purpose that made him one of the FBI's most valuable — and vilified — government informants. He used his real name to start a website and to self-publish a memoir (with a second underway). He is trying to fashion himself as a consultant on the murky world of Islamic terrorism and undercover work. He gives seminars to law school students and FBI recruits. After blowing through the 1 million he says he received from the U.S. government, Salem toiled as an innkeeper, sold jewelry wholesale, taught karate and scuba diving, ran a juice bar and worked as a masseur. \\"I'm tired of all that,\\" said Salem, who agreed to two days of interviews at an open-air restaurant here on Florida's Gold Coast. \\"It is time for me to talk now. I was shut up for 20-some years.\\" :: Salem was born in Egypt, where he served in the military for 18 years, rising to the rank of army lieutenant colonel. In 1987, he emigrated to the United States. He worked in New York as a security guard at an off-Broadway hotel, and was recruited by the FBI to monitor hotel guests suspected of being Russian mobsters. It is time for me to talk now. I was shut up for 20-some years. - Emad Salem, FBI informant In time, the undercover assignments grew. When El Sayyid Nosair stood trial in New York for killing a militant rabbi in 1990, Salem infiltrated his supporters. Soon he became head of security for their leader, Omar Abdel Rahman, known as the blind sheik. He says he has carried a good measure of guilt because shortly before the bombing of the World Trade Center, he refused to wear a hidden FBI microphone and dropped out of the undercover work. He told agents wearing a wire was too risky and might bring harm to him or someone in his family. He later regretted that decision, saying he could have saved the six lives lost in that attack. \\"I could have stopped it,\\" he said. \\"But I failed.\\" To ease that guilt, Salem volunteered in 1993 to return to the terrorist cell to try to nail the conspirators in the second plot to detonate New York landmarks, including the United Nations building. This time he wore a wire. Salem's testimony in 1995 led to several convictions, including those of Abdel Rahman and Nosair. Both were given life sentences without parole. \\"He really did care about trying to help this country,\\" said Andrew McCarthy, the lead federal prosecutor in Abdel Rahman's case. Salem, McCarthy said, was \\"patriotic and very brave.\\" But McCarthy also said Salem sometimes made up stories about his exploits in Egypt and elsewhere. \\"And he had a bad relationship with the FBI, with the institution.\\" Salem and his family were whisked into the federal protection program just moments after he left the witness stand. \\"It all began abruptly, out of nowhere,\\" said his son, Tom Fox, now 31. \\"One day I was told I had an hour to get everything together, and we had to go. I packed a small, little suitcase. My clothes. A few toys. My little action figures, a little monster truck.\\" Salem and his family found it difficult to leave their past behind. Once, they were in a fancy steak restaurant when Salem saw a man who resembled a terrorist cell member. He hurried his family out. Another time, his daughter blurted out his real name in school. The family moved, Salem said. Not long ago in Florida, Salem said, he spotted a van behind his Surf N Spray hotel, with suspicious characters lurking inside. The sighting led him to relocate his family. \\"We moved so many times, it became a habit,\\" his son said. \\"I can't remember it all.\\" Salem says the family has lived in New Jersey, Minnesota, Tennessee, California and now Florida. He still uses an alias in daily life and wants to change it once again to protect his real identity. He also wants to leave South Florida. Before he went underground, Salem was described by friends and colleagues as distrustful and sometimes erratic. He secretly taped his FBI handlers and suggested they had ignored warning signs about a pending attack, allegations the FBI strongly denied. Life in witness protection may have only heightened his anxieties. His apartment is wired with a motion detector, though only he and his wife, Karin, live there now that the children have grown. He frequently checks a cellphone app that monitors any activity outside his house. The phone vibrates if someone approaches the front door. He has installed the security measures himself. Once known as No. 6220 in the protection program, he says he lost his government protection after his sister moved back to Cairo, and U.S. law enforcement officials felt they could no longer guarantee his safety should someone learn his whereabouts through her. He's certain Al Qaeda wants revenge. He can still hear the blind sheik in the courtroom, jumping to his feet and issuing a fatwa — a death sentence — against him. \\"You are Satan!\\" Abdel Rahman screamed at Salem. Salem's attorney, Joseph Brien, cautioned him against going public. \\"The higher his profile, the bigger the target he will become,\\" Brien said. \\"There is still the fatwa with his name on it. It's still out there. The fanatics still have him in their sights.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Emad Salem, an undercover FBI informant who infiltrated a terrorist cell behind the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, shared his experiences living in hiding and the impact on his family over the past two decades.

This infrastructure plays a crucial role in supporting and strengthening the capacity of non-profit entities, allowing them to deliver programs and services that have a positive impact on their target communities and beneficiaries. Non-profit infrastructure is a multifaceted concept encompassing a wide range of components. Some key aspects include: 1. Organizational Structure: Non-profit infrastructure relies on a well-defined organizational structure, including a board of directors, executive management, staff, and volunteers. This structure helps guide the organization’s operations, decision-making, and overall strategic direction. 2. Financial Management: Efficient financial management systems are essential in the non-profit infrastructure. These systems involve budgeting, financial reporting, auditing, and compliance with reporting requirements and regulations, ensuring that the organization uses its resources responsibly and sustainably. 3. Fundraising and Resource Mobilization: Non-profit organizations rely heavily on external sources of funding, such as grants, donations, sponsorships, and other forms of support. A robust fundraising and resource mobilization structure enables them to secure the necessary funds to fulfill their mission. 4. Technology: Technology plays a vital role in non-profit infrastructure, providing tools for communication, data management, fundraising, and service delivery. Effective technology infrastructure includes hardware, software, databases, and systems that enable the organization to meet its objectives and requirements. 5. Human Resources: People are the backbone of any non-profit organization. Investing in talent acquisition, training, and retention is crucial for a strong non-profit infrastructure. This includes developing policies, procedures, and practices to support staff and volunteers in their roles. 6. Collaboration and Networking: Non-profit organizations often work in partnership with other entities, such as government agencies, businesses, educational institutions, and other non-profits. Establishing and maintaining strong networks and collaborative relationships are integral to the non-profit infrastructure, as they help to share resources, expertise, and best practices. 7. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Non-profit organizations operate within a specific legal and regulatory environment, which requires adherence to various laws, rules, and regulations related to tax-exemption status, governance, advocacy, and more. Ensuring compliance is essential to maintain credibility, public trust, and eligibility for funding. 8. Program Development and Evaluation: Non-profit infrastructure must support the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs and services that meet the needs of beneficiaries and align with the organization's mission. This involves continuous assessment, monitoring, and improvement to optimize impact and efficacy. 9. Communications and Marketing: Effective communications and marketing strategies help non-profits raise awareness about their work, engage stakeholders, and secure financial support. Non-profit infrastructure should include robust systems and tools for managing public relations, social media, branding, and other communication channels. 10. Governance and Leadership: A non-profit organization's infrastructure must also support strong governance and leadership. This includes creating a culture of accountability, transparency, and ethical conduct that guides decision-making and ensures alignment with the organization's mission and values. In conclusion, non-profit infrastructure is the backbone of any successful non-profit organization. It encompasses a range of interconnected components that collectively enable these organizations to fulfill their mission, maintain accountability, and create positive societal impact. By investing in and nurturing a robust non-profit infrastructure, organizations can strengthen their capacity to serve their communities and contribute to the greater good."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244.

Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors trying to prove that Oscar Pistorius murdered his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp appeared to have won a round on Tuesday morning, but it was the defense team that was smiling by the end of the day. Tuesday's testimony began with the expert who conducted the autopsy on Steenkamp, Gert Saayman. He backed two key points of the state's case. He estimated that Steenkamp had eaten about two hours before she died, which contradicts Pistorius' version of events, and he said that the victim would have been able to scream after the first two bullets hit her, as the prosecution argues. \\"I think it would be somewhat abnormal if one did not scream when sustaining a wound of this nature,\\" Saayman testified of the \\"particularly devastating\\" injury to","completion":"Steenkamp's hip. Furthermore, Saayman stated that the third bullet, which struck Steenkamp's head, would have caused massive trauma and instant incapacitation, rendering her unable to respond, meaning any further shots would have been unnecessary. The prosecution used this testimony to argue that Pistorius' claim of mistaking Steenkamp for an intruder was false, as her screams should have been audible to him. However, as the trial progressed, the defense team, led by Barry Roux, began to poke holes in the prosecution's case. They focused primarily on forensic and ballistic evidence. Roux brought in an independent forensic expert, Dr. David Klatzow, who examined the ballistic and blood spatter evidence at the crime scene. Klatzow criticized the police's handling of the case, noting that many pieces of evidence had been contaminated. For instance, the position of the bullet casings had been disturbed during the investigation, making it difficult to reconstruct the exact sequence of events. Roux also successfully challenged elements of Saayman's testimony. He questioned several of the prosecution's expert witnesses, raising doubts about their conclusions. The defense argued that the meal Steenkamp supposedly ate two hours before her death could have been a snack rather than a full meal, possibly in response to a bout of insomnia. Roux also brought forth witnesses who testified that Pistorius, despite his disability, could easily have confused Steenkamp's screams for those of an intruder. As the trial drew to a close, there were few definitive answers regarding Pistorius' actions on that fateful night. Judge Thokozile Masipa, along with her assessors, deliberated for several weeks before delivering their verdict. In the end, Judge Masipa found Oscar Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide but acquitted him of premeditated murder. This decision came as a shock to many who had expected a murder conviction. The Judge cited a lack of conclusive evidence proving that Pistorius knowingly killed Steenkamp. Pistorius was sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, with the possibility of parole after serving at least one-third of his sentence. He began serving his sentence at the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Center in Pretoria in October 2014. Reeva Steenkamp's family and the prosecution expressed disappointment with the verdict and sentence, viewing it as too lenient. The state went on to appeal the conviction and sentencing in the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December 2015, the original verdict was overturned, and the court found Pistorius guilty of murder, with the presiding Judge Lorimer Leach stating that the initial judgment had been \\"fundamentally flawed.\\" The case returned to the Pretoria High Court for sentencing, and in July 2016, Judge Masipa sentenced Pistorius to six years in prison. The state appealed the sentence again, calling it \\"shockingly lenient.\\" Ultimately, in November 2017, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal increased Pistorius' sentence from six years to 13 years and five months. As the legal process finally reached its conclusion, Oscar Pistorius remained in prison, his hopes of returning to the world of professional sports shattered. The tragic death of Reeva Steenkamp and the dramatic trial that followed will forever remain a pivotal moment in South African legal history, serving as a stark reminder of the complex issues surrounding crime, justice, and celebrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: A much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever-declining spiral of domestic violence. At times difficult to watch, while Morris Day is portrayed as the misogynist, Prince as the knight on (motorcycle) steed, he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay. That he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing. Prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women, but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Even further, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (admittedly the album's weakest track) and Darling Nikki - are shown as being songs that kill off an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the Princely ego is a card that lists the (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia as 5'6. The nearly complete-amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves (and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point), and do perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham, though Jerome Benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well, particularly their stage act, which is hilarious. Day and Benton even go so far as to make an Abbott and Costello routine funny, which takes some doing. Lastly, there's Prince. While I admit to bias, I do actually think he's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low-key version of himself. Acting ISN'T his profession, this was a film made for entertainment, so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't Robert DeNiro and thinking they're making a point is sadly deluded. I don't want this review to be a derisory attack of other people's comments, but I've even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit. How would a film about domestic violence be shot, then? With full overhead spotlights and a CGI dinosaur walking into frame? The film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths, and this isn't some retro-recreation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Check out multiple restaurant menus. Start with soup. Go for steamed over fried. Always order a vegetable. Order brown rice. Make changes to the cooking methods.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Savor the Healthiest Meal: Tips for Ordering from Restaurant Menus Introduction: Dining out presents a cornucopia of flavors that is unmatched by homemade meals. But, the experience often seems daunting for health-conscious individuals who are trying to maintain their balanced diet plans. Worry not; the guide below will help you navigate restaurant menus and make the right choices that not only suit your palate but also keep your health in check. 1. Check out Multiple Restaurant Menus: With numerous dining options available, it's essential to explore multiple restaurant menus before you settle for one. Doing this lets you compare your choices from various cuisines, ensuring you have access to the most nutritious dishes. Moreover, researching beforehand can also provide an overview of the calorie count, ingredients, and portion sizes offered by different establishments. 2. Start with the Soup: Soups are an excellent way to kick off your culinary adventure without compromising on nutrition. They can act as a natural appetite suppressant due to their high water content, ensuring that you eat less during the main course. Soups also aid digestion, provide essential nutrients, and keep you hydrated. Opt for clear broths or vegetable-based soup rather than creamy versions that are laden with cream and butter. These low-calorie, nutrient-dense versions will fuel your body without adding unwanted pounds. 3. Go for Steamed Over Fried: While it is tempting to indulge in fried delicacies, prioritize steamed dishes when checking restaurant menus. Steamed foods generally contain fewer fats, oils, and calories, retaining greater amounts of essential nutrients without sacrificing taste. Steaming requires minimal added ingredients to cook, securing its spot as one of the healthiest cooking methods. Choose steamed items such as fish, vegetables, or dumplings to make your dining experience more nourishing. 4. Always Order a Vegetable: Incorporating vegetables into your meal is a must, as they boast vibrant colors, rich textures, and a myriad of nutrients. Vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber, assisting weight management and promoting healthy digestion. They also contain essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that boost your immune system and ward off chronic diseases. Try ordering vegetable-based side dishes, such as salads, grilled asparagus, or steamed broccoli, to enhance your meal's overall nutrition profile. 5. Opt for Brown Rice: When choosing your staple food, pick brown rice over white or fried rice. Brown rice is an unrefined, whole grain that contains more natural nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Its high fiber content helps maintain stable blood sugar levels, supports digestion, and keeps you full for longer periods. Additionally, the complex carbohydrates in brown rice provide a steady source of energy to keep you fueled throughout the day. 6. Make Changes to the Cooking Methods: Do not be afraid to ask for modifications to the dish's cooking method to make it healthier. For instance, request that your food be grilled, poached, or roasted rather than fried. Similarly, ask for a lighter touch on the sauce, using olive oil instead of butter, or serving the dressing or sauce on the side. These small adjustments can dramatically decrease the calorie content of the dish while preserving its delectable flavors. Conclusion: No longer does dining out have to be synonymous with unhealthy choices. Understanding restaurant menus and mindfully making decisions can ensure you enjoy a wholesome meal without worrying about derailing your health goals. Adhering to these simple guidelines can transform your culinary outings into nutritious and gratifying experiences, allowing you to savor every bite without guilt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a multiple-choice question and need to classify your answer as 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'e'. Let's break down the task into simple steps: 1. Read the problem: Two trains are traveling toward each other from Howrah to Patna and from Patna to Howrah. They start at the same time and meet at some point. After they meet, it takes one train 9 hours to reach Howrah and the other train 25 hours to reach Patna. 2. Determine the goal: Find the ratio of their speeds. 3. Solve the problem: - When two objects move toward each other, their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds. - Let the speed of the train going from Howrah to Patna be S1 and the speed of the train going from Patna to Howrah be S2. - Since the trains meet at some point, they would have traveled for the same amount of time before meeting each other. Let's call this time 't'. - The distance covered by the first train before meeting the second train is S1 * t, and the distance covered by the second train is S2 * t. - After meeting, the first train takes another 9 hours to reach Howrah. Since it's the same distance, we can write the equation: S1 * t = S2 * 9. - Similarly, after meeting, the second train takes another 25 hours to reach Patna. So we can write the equation: S2 * t = S1 * 25. - Dividing the two equations we have: (S1 * t) / (S2 * t) = 9 / 25. The t's cancel out, leaving us with: S1 / S2 = 9 / 25. 4. Compare the result with the given options: - The ratio of their speeds is 9:25, but this ratio is not provided in the options. However, it is closest to option 'a' (4:5), suggesting that the answer would be 'a' if we had simplified the ratio. 5.

Trump’s big speech only hurt him At a rally in Detroit Aug. 8, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outlined what he would do as president to take the U.S. economy to \\"amazing new heights.\\" (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Donald Trump’s speech at the Detroit Economic Club, if anything, only hurt him at a time he’s plunging in the polls. Here are seven reasons: 1. To put it bluntly, wonkish and intellectually honest Republicans of the type who would pay attention to an economic speech long ago figured out Trump is a fraud. They know his numbers don’t add up and his anti-globalism is bunk. Conservative Doug Holtz-Eakins called it an “incoherent mess,” blasting his “horrific ideas (renegotiating NAFTA, killing TPP, tariffs, and other anti-trade initiatives)” and chiding him for leaving out a list of critical issues. “No mention of federal debt or deficits. No mention of entitlement reforms. No mention of productivity, innovation, the internet, or new and online business models,” he observed. “Nothing, really, about the future. Just a call to return to the steel and cars of the industrial past.” So whom was Trump’s speech targeting? Surely, no one who knows much about economics. 2. Trump managed to confuse even those few people who liked his tax plan. The Post reported: Many tax experts said Trump’s latest speech reveals an even sketchier picture of his economic vision than previous proposals. “In general, it’s less clear of a tax plan than it was before,” said Ryan Ellis, a senior fellow at the Conservative Reform Network. First, Trump pitched new, less aggressive tax cuts and appeared to be backing away from his pledge to end tax liability for 75 million households. Then he introduced a proposal for an investment income loophole that could actually benefit hedge fund managers and suggested a tax break for child care that would do little for the lowest income earners. “He’s actually doing less for the middle class than he originally planned,” said Martin A. Sullivan, the chief economist at Tax Analysts. Ellis, who previously served as the tax policy director for Grover Norquist’s group Americans for Tax Reform, said Trump’s proposal to allow parents to deduct the cost of child care would provide no benefit to low income workers and single parents who are unlikely to have any tax liability to begin with. Republicans were supposed to oppose new deductions and special giveaways. 3. Trump’s fixation on the estate tax — which is applicable to only a tiny fraction of estates (north of 5.4 million) — is the sort of thing that applies to the hardcore, Wall Street-centric GOP base, not even to his own supporters. It’s the quintessential bone to the very, very rich. It’s perfect fodder for Hillary Clinton’s argument he is no friend of the working man. 4. Stilted reading off a teleprompter does not give voters or donors any confidence he has learned anything about policy. To the contrary, it emphasizes that he can sound mildly sane only when he is not saying what he really thinks. 5. Trump is still fixated on the media. Few people listen or hear a speech like this; he expects the media to report on it to persuade voters he has gotten his act together. The mainstream media, which is no longer friendly territory, (rightly) takes the opportunity to fact-check him. He never seems to have grasped that one cannot win a general election relying on the beneficence of free media. 6. Trump’s trade inanity only reaffirms his ignorance about economics. He in essence does not think the United States can really win in the international free market. It’s a loser’s attitude. He claims, “Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost 60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly 800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost 800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.” This is nonsense, as countless economists, businesspeople and rational conservatives will tell you. (“It would be foolhardy to force American businesses and consumers to pay more and have less freedom to choose,” writes former trade rep Robert B. Zoellick. “Lower taxes on imports from trade deals save the average U.S. household about 10,000 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Yet Mr. Trump wants to impose steep tariffs to ‘win’ on trade.” 7. He still has virtually no serious policy ideas on issues many voters care about. He declared, “One of my first acts as president will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.” And replace it with what? Don’t ask! (Moreover, The Post’s fact-checkers explain the 2 million jobs figure isn’t what Trump thinks it is.) In sum, Trump’s gloom-and-doom message, far from telling us how we win again, says we cannot win. He rejects globalism, which has lifted billions of people out of poverty, provides a panoply of goods and services and maximizes benefits for those who can participate. Rather than help Americans compete (e.g., with job training, open markets), he’s the one ironically who wants to “rig the system” — with tariffs and barriers that make life tougher for the working and middle classes and economically nonproductive giveaways to the super-rich, people like him and his rich panel of economic advisers.

Write an article based on this summary: – Donald Trump's campaign is on damage control after one of the most damaging leaks in election history—but some commentators aren't sure if he'll be able to recover at all from the release of a 2005 \\"hot mic\\" tape in which he makes some very crude comments about women. The candidate is facing an almost unprecedented backlash from his own party, with some leading Republicans calling for him to step down as the nominee. A round-up of coverage: House Speaker Paul Ryan is one of scores of leading Republicans now trying to distance themselves from Trump, the Washington Post reports. He released a statement saying he is \\"sickened\\" by the comments—and Trump is no longer invited to a Wisconsin campaign event he was supposed to attend Saturday. CNN looks at how the old Access Hollywood tape made its way to the media at a very unfortunate time for Trump. Sources say a producer remembered the tape early in the week and, after digging it up mid-week, the show planned to air it Monday—but a copy made its way to the Washington Post first. CBS reports that Mike Pence has been refusing to answer reporters' questions about the tape. Reporters accompanying Pence were suddenly ushered out of a restaurant when the tape became public Friday. At a rally in Ohio that evening, Pence said that Trump emerges \\"still standing stronger than ever before\\" whenever he is targeted by the media. Republican fundraising chief Spencer Zwick tells the AP that he has been getting phone calls from donors who \\"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\\" He says a write-in campaign \\"could actually work,\\" although some states don't allow write-in candidates. The Los Angeles Times reports that even Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads a pro-Trump super PAC and had his hands full dealing with Hurricane Matthew, found the time to denounce Trump's comments. \\"I'm not following politics closely right now, but this is terrible,\\" he said. \\"I don't agree with anyone talking like this about anyone, ever.\\" The New York Times takes a look at what it calls \\"the apology that wasn't.\\" Sources say Trump huddled with advisers, including daughter Ivanka, before issuing the brief—and defiant apology—late Friday. The insiders say aides urged Trump not to mention the Clintons in the apology, but their advice was ignored. NBC News has statements from many of the Republicans who have condemned the remarks, including RNC chief Reince Priebus. \\"It's over,\\" a GOP strategist and Trump supporter tells the network. \\"Never seen anything like it. Never will.\\" People reports that Billy Bush, the co-host heard making lewd comments along with Trump, says he is \\"embarrassed and ashamed and is sorry for \\"playing along\\" with Trump. Trump tells the Washington Post he's staying in the race. “I’d never withdraw. I’ve never withdrawn in my life,” he says, citing \\"tremendous support.\\"","completion":"Donald Trump is in a lot of trouble because he said some really bad things about women a long time ago.

This is making a lot of people say bad things about Donald Trump and some people don't think he will be able to win the election anymore. A lot of his friends, like Paul Ryan and Mike Pence, are trying to stay away from him and not talk about what he said because it's very bad.

Then, you can continue drawing squares on the poster board or just draw a straight line across them.. - Draw your squares using a ruler or sponge to ensure that they are evenly spaced. Use adhesive fillers to make the grid more permanent.. - Ideally, you should have 100 players total, but this isn't a hard rule. Use a ruler to keep your lines straight as you draw.. - Again, when you make your chosen squares, it's not just you, but players and spectators who will be watching you play. Make two squares of each in your grid.. Answer:","completion":"Draw your squares using a ruler or a straight edge to ensure that they are evenly spaced and uniform in size. This will make it easier for everyone to read and understand the grid. If possible, use adhesive fillers or laminating sheets to make the grid more permanent and protect it from damage. This way, the football squares board can be reused for multiple games, events, or seasons. Additionally, having a neat and clean-looking grid will make the game more enjoyable for players and spectators alike, as it will be easier to identify which squares belong to whom. Once the grid is set up, have players sign up to participate by writing their initials or names in their chosen squares. To make the game fair, limit each player to a certain number of squares (for example, three or four) so more people have a chance to participate. Now, you will need to assign random numbers to each column and row along the top and left edges of the grid, ranging from 0 to 9. Use a hat, data randomizer tool, or number generator to ensure the numbers are genuinely random. Write the numbers in the designated spaces outside the grid where everyone can see them. These numbers correspond to the last digit of each team's score during the game. For example, if the score of a game is 17-14 and you have the square corresponding to \\"7\\" on the top row and \\"4\\" on the side column, you would win that quarter or play. It is common to give out prizes after each quarter and have a larger prize for the final score. Throughout the game, players will be able to track the progression of numbers that match their squares. They can compare this with the current scores of the football game to determine if they are close to winning the round. Once a round is over and a winner has been declared, clear the current scores and start again for the next quarter. This process continues until all prizes have been awarded or the game ends. In summary, setting up and playing football squares requires a neatly drawn 10x10 grid, the participation of players in choosing their squares, the assignment of random numbers to each row and column, and the tracking of scores throughout the game to determine the winner for each round. This engaging and entertaining game can be played during various football events and seasons, providing excitement for both players and spectators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\".

The teacher's statement implies a contrast between the two students and highlights the importance of perseverance and focus when it comes to acquiring language skills. Learning a language is not something that can be mastered quickly or easily; it requires dedication, practice, and continuous exposure to the spoken and written forms of the language. Discipline and a structured study routine play a crucial role in language acquisition. Moreover, making use of a variety of learning resources and methods can contribute to a more comprehensive and effective learning experience. For instance, actively engaging in conversation with native speakers, enrolling in a language course, leveraging multimedia resources (e.g., books, videos, or podcasts), and adopting a growth mindset are all essential ingredients for language-learning success.

What is the answer to this question? what is the origin of the name anthony?","completion":"The origin of the name Anthony can be traced back to ancient Rome but has deeper roots in ancient Greece. Anthony is an English version of the Roman family name \\"Antonius,\\" which was derived from the Greek name \\"Antonios.\\" Throughout history, the name Anthony has held immense popularity and significance, especially due to its association with influential figures and noble Roman families. The Greek name \\"Antonios\\" is believed to have been derived from the ancient Greek word \\"anthos,\\" which means \\"flower\\" or \\"blossom.\\" This etymological link connects the name Anthony with the notion of beauty and growth. Additionally, some sources claim that the name could be linked to the Greek words \\"anti\\" and \\"eon,\\" meaning \\"against\\" and \\"time\\" respectively. In this context, the name Anthony could be interpreted as someone who is timeless or enduring. During the Roman Republic and Empire era, the name Antonius was associated with one of the most prominent and powerful families, the gens Antonia. The gens Antonia was one of the few Roman families to gain noble status, which they attained through their influence, political alliances, and successful military campaigns. The most famous member of this family was Marcus Antonius, known as Mark Antony in English, a Roman general and politician who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Throughout the spread of Christianity, the name Anthony gained further popularity due to the life and influence of Saint Anthony the Great, also known as Saint Anthony of Egypt. Born in the 3rd century, Saint Anthony was a Christian monk who is considered the founder of Christian monasticism. His life and teachings had a profound impact on the early Christian world and continue to inspire followers to this day. The prominence of St. Anthony in Christian history has contributed to the name's continued prevalence and adoption in various forms across different languages and cultures. The name Anthony, as it is commonly used today, mostly owes its popularity to the English-speaking world, where it has been a consistently favored name in the UK and the United States. Due to historical influences and the name's versatility, Anthony has various forms and equivalents in other cultures and languages, such as Antonio in Spanish and Italian, Antoine in French, Anton in German and Russian, and Antal in Hungarian, among many others. In summary, the origin of the name Anthony can be traced back to ancient Greece through the Greek name \\"Antonios,\\" which was later adopted by the influential Roman family, gens Antonia. The popularity and longstanding influence of the name are attributed to its association with prominent historical figures and its adaptability in different languages and cultures. Today, the name Anthony continues to be a popular choice for newborns and holds significant cultural and historical value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this summary: As if nothing had changed, Welsh farmers will have risen early this morning to milk their cows or feed their stock.","completion":"Title: The Timeless Tradition of Welsh Farmers: Rise and Shine to Feed and Nurture Introduction In the picturesque countryside of Wales, a daily ritual takes place. As the first light of day creeps over the horizon, Welsh farmers rise early to begin their day with a dedication to their stock. Milking cows and feeding animals mark the beginning of their daily tasks, and this tradition remains unchanged despite the ever-evolving world around them. This article aims to delve into the lives of Welsh farmers and showcase the significance of this age-old practice in today's modern world. A Timeless Routine: Welsh Farmers and Their Altruistic Animals Before the sun even breaks the horizon, Welsh farmers embark on their routine journey to their fields, barns, and stables. Their bond with their animals is palpable, with the understanding that without these hardworking farmers, their livestock would not be able to flourish. From the moment they step outside, the integrated relationship between human and animal is apparent. Cows, in particular, are creatures of habit. They, too, have adjusted their wake-up times to the familiar footsteps of their human caretakers. As the farmer's trusty companions, these animals depend on their morning ritual for nourishment and comfort. This collaboration between farmer and cow is essential for maintaining a healthy, productive relationship. Step 1: Preparing for the Day Before the farmer can begin the milking process or feed their other stock, there is a series of preparatory steps they must first complete. These include checking the overall health of the animals, cleaning milking utensils, and assessing any necessary equipment updates. Proper sanitation and maintenance are crucial to ensuring the well-being of animals and minimising the risk of infection or illnesses. Step 2: Milking the Cows Dairy farmers' expertise is on full display during the milking process, which remains a vital part of the economy in Wales and the United Kingdom. By maintaining a calm and structured atmosphere, farmers foster a sense of security, making it easier for cows to release milk. With the help of advanced milking equipment, farmers can optimize the milking process, improving both the efficiency and well-being of their animals. Step 3: Feeding Stock In addition to milking duties, Welsh farmers are responsible for feeding their stock a balanced and nutritious diet. The key is to ensure that they receive adequate nutrients for their specific needs, whether that's supporting lactation, growth, or health maintenance. This process usually involves mixing a carefully crafted blend of feed, hay, and L silage, specifically tailored to suit each animal's needs. Conclusion: The Cornerstone of Community and Respect Today's Welsh farmers continue to uphold a timeless tradition in which the well-being of their animals is their top priority. From rising before the sun to tend to their stock, to updating their methods to provide the utmost care and comfort, their efforts are a testament to the resilience of communities built upon hard work and collaboration. In an ever-changing, fast-paced world, their unshakeable commitment to nurturing animals affirms the value of this ancient practice, ensuring that it remains a cornerstone in the lives of Welsh farmers for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more minerals will form happens, how will it affect LESS minerals forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If more minerals are formed as per the perturbation hypothesis, it could potentially have an indirect effect on the process leading to less mineral formation. As the increased formation of minerals can alter the environmental conditions, such as the pressure, temperature, and the availability of magma, lava, and dissolved minerals in the water, these changes may affect the rate at which minerals are formed. For example, if more minerals are formed inside the crust, it might decrease the availability of magma, which could slow down the process of magma crystallization and mineral formation. Similarly, if more minerals are formed due to lava cooling and crystallization on the surface, it might make the environment less favorable for further mineral formation. Additionally, if there is an increased rate of dissolved minerals crystallizing from water, it might reduce the concentration of minerals in the water making it harder for more minerals to form. However, it is important to note that the perturbation hypothesis only proposes a possibility and specific details of how the environment might change would depend on factors such as the type of rock, chemical composition of the magma and water, and the temperature and pressure conditions. So, the actual effect of the perturbation on the process might vary in different situations, ranging from no significant effect to moderate or even strong impacts on the rate of mineral formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot.

Question: I have a new situation: Over the years, the town of Euphoria has grown more successful and wealthier than anyone ever thought. As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression. The town of Zenphora, on the other hand, has taken a downward financial turn over the past 50 years. The citizens have had to sell their worldly goods just to make ends meet and many do not have a good feeling about what their future holds. But I can use this background: Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity. What is an answer for this question: Which town is more optimistic, Euphoria or Zenphora? Answer:","completion":"Euphoria is the more optimistic town between the two. The background information provided shows a positive association between a country's wealth and its citizens' subjective well-being (SWB), which includes factors such as optimism, financial satisfaction, and material prosperity. Diener and colleagues found that income plays a significant role in people's evaluations of their lives and that life satisfaction generally increases as a country becomes wealthier over time. In the given situation, the town of Euphoria has experienced increasing wealth and success over the years. This has led to its citizens acquiring more material possessions and developing a more positive outlook on life. The reported lower incidence of depression in Euphoria also suggests its citizens have higher overall SWB. On the other hand, Zenphora has faced a downward financial turn, forcing its citizens to sell their possessions and feeling uncertain about their future. This financial downturn negatively impacts the SWB of Zenphora citizens, as they struggle to maintain personal material prosperity and financial satisfaction. Based on the research by Diener and colleagues and the respective situations of both towns, Euphoria appears to be the more optimistic town when compared to Zenphora."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. Last updated at 3:19 PM on 20th July 2011. Under pressure: David Cameron leaves Downing Street on his way to address the Commons about phone hacking. Rupert Murdoch's company was guilty of ‘deliberately thwarting’ the criminal investigation into the News of the World, according to a hard-hitting report published today. The Home Affairs Select Committee study ‘deplores’ the behaviour of News International and condemns the police for bungling their investigation and getting too close to the Murdoch empire. The report raises questions about the honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Andy Hayman, who oversaw the original 2006 police probe of the newspaper. The development came before David Cameron made an emergency statement on the scandal to the House of Commons. He faced questions from MPs about his party's links to phone hacking suspect Neil Wallis. The Prime Minister arrived home from a. shortened trip to Africa last night as it was revealed that his. communications chief Andy Coulson, had been advised by Mr. Wallis in the run-up to the general election. In. a further extraordinary development, Labour MP Chris Bryant today. hinted that the Queen may have told Mr Cameron not to hire Mr Coulson. Mr Bryant told the BBC: 'Very senior. people at Buckingham Palace were very troubled by the appointment of. Andy Coulson and tried to make it absolutely clear to the Prime. Minister. 'I am not sure whether this information ever got directly to the Prime. Minister, but it certainly got to senior figures at Downing Street. 'The Queen's grandchildren had their phones hacked. And quite probably. other members of the Royal Household ... I think it would be perfectly. natural for very senior members of the Royal Family to be very troubled. about the appointment. 'After all, Andy Coulson was the editor of the. News of the World when the royal princes' phones were hacked. That is. not in dispute. Morning after the night before: Rupert Murdoch left his house today reading the front page of his paper The Times which covers his appearance at the Commons select committee. 'And Andy Coulson resigned from the News of the. World expressly because of the hacking of the royal princes' phones.' Mr Bryant did not name the Queen directly. His claim prompted a furious denial from Downing Street. A No 10 source said the allegation was 'scurrilous' and 'complete rubbish'. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt leaves the House of Commons after Rupert Murdoch and his son James gave evidence. Today he defended the Prime Minister's handling of the scandal. In his statement Mr. Cameron will announce the names of the panel that will. look at press regulation and the final terms of reference for the. judge-led inquiry into claims about phone hacking and illegal payments. to police. But, after the Murdochs, Rebekah Brooks and senior police. officers were grilled in an extraordinary series of Commons committee. hearings, the Prime Minister will now be in the firing line. Aides. have indicated that he expects to be questioned by MPs on the admission. last night that Coulson, ex-News of the World editor, was received help. from Wallis, former deputy editor at the same newspaper. Both men have. been arrested and bailed in connection with the Scotland Yard hacking. inquiry. A senior Cabinet minister defended Mr Cameron's handling of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal today as the Prime Minister prepared to face a barrage of MPs' questions over his role in the affair. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied that the continuing political firestorm represented the biggest crisis of Mr Cameron's premiership so far. But he acknowledged that the Prime Minister needed to demonstrate he was capable of the leadership needed to sort out the crisis which has rocked politicians, police and the media. He said Mr Cameron 'didn't have a crystal ball\\" but has made big decisions 'to sort this out'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'What we've seen is that he's recalled Parliament, he's got an independent police inquiry, he's got an independent judge-led inquiry, he's published all the meetings he's had with media owners and said in the future ministers will publish all the meetings that they have with media proprietors, so he's done more in a couple of weeks than I think any other prime minister has done in a couple of decades and I think that is the key judgment call that the people of Britain will be looking for him to make.' Mr Hunt added the Murdochs' committee hearing had shown that 'so much wrongdoing seemed to happen without the knowledge of the people at the top'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'But it does seem like a huge amount was going wrong in that organisation and no one felt it necessary to tell the person at the top, and I think that was something that will have worried a lot of people.' The report raises issues about the honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, left. It also said the conduct of former assistant Met commissioner Andy Hayman, right, during the investigation and 'during our evidence session was both unprofessional and inappropriate’ Scotland Yard's current communications chief Dick Fedorcio, left, was also criticised for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on Neil Wallis, right, the ex-News of the World deputy editor. The Conservatives disclosed yesterday. that former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis had given. informal advice to Andy Coulson when he was Mr Cameron's communications. director in the run-up to the general election. The role of Mr Wallis - who was. arrested last week by police investigating the phone-hacking allegations. - was already under scrutiny after it was disclosed that he had been. working for Scotland Yard as a part-time PR consultant. In a further twist, Downing Street. released emails yesterday showing that Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed. Llewellyn had prevented senior police officers briefing Mr Cameron on. the phone-hacking investigation. He wrote to Assistant Commissioner. John Yates telling him 'we will want to be able to be entirely clear,. for your sake and ours, that we have not been in contact with you about. this subject'. Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell. ruled last night that Mr Llewellyn had acted 'entirely properly' but the. disclosure is likely to increase the pressure on the Prime Minister. He is already facing demands to. apologise for appointing Mr Coulson after he quit as News of the World. editor in 2007 after royal reporter Clive Goodman and private. investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for hacking the phones of royal. aides. The Home Affairs Select Committee said in its withering assessment today: ‘We deplore the response of News International to the original investigation into hacking. ‘It is almost impossible to escape. the conclusion that they were deliberately trying to thwart a criminal. investigation. We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for. News International to co-operate with the police.’ The. report points out that Mrs Brooks’s denial of knowledge of phone. hacking ‘is limited to her time as editor of News of the World’, a small. part of her career in News International. Holding hands, Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi leave Parliament after yesterday's hearing. And. it also raises concerns about her knowledge of illegal payments to. corrupt police officers. ‘She did not say that she had no knowledge of. specific payments but that she had not intended to give the impression. that she had knowledge of specific cases,’ the MPs conclude. The committee condemns the police,. singling out former assistant Met commissioner Mr Hayman, criticising. his handling of the case, his social contacts with News International. executives and his decision to take a job with the firm after leaving. the police. It said:. ‘Mr Hayman’s conduct during the investigation and during our evidence. session was both unprofessional and inappropriate.’ There was also criticism in the. report for Dick Fedorcio, Scotland Yard's current communications chief,. for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on. Neil Wallis. Mr Wallis,. an ex-News of the World executive, was employed by the Met in 2009 and. was last week questioned about phone hacking allegations. The committee said it was. 'particularly shocked' by Mr Fedorcio's approach to hiring Wallis and. said he tried to deflect blame on to Mr Yates. MPs called for extra funding to support Operation Weeting, saying it would take years to inform all potential victims without it. They praised Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers' decision to contact all potential victims of phone hacking by the News of the World. But they said they were 'alarmed' that only 170 had have so far been informed, adding that 'up to 12,800 people may have been affected.' David Cameron chats to a mother about her twins during a visit yesterday to an immunisation clinic in Lagos, Nigeria. The Prime Minister cut short his visit to Africa so he could make a statement to the House of Commons today. ● Police officers will be jailed for accepting cash bribes from News of the World journalists, MPs were told yesterday. The newspaper is alleged to have paid tens of thousands of pounds to officers who supplied information. Asked by MPs on a parliamentary committee if any officers would go to prison, the outgoing assistant commissioner of the Met Police, John Yates, replied: ‘If the corruption cases, which are very small in number, are properly investigated, I have no doubt.’ Mr Yates resigned from the force on Monday after he was told he faced suspension over his links to the newspaper.

Summarize the following: Most dead skin build-up occurs in and around your bed because you spend so much time there. This attracts dust mites and accumulates allergens. You will want to have multiple blankets, sheets and pillowcase covers to switch out with. Wash all blankets, sheets, pillow cases, bed covers and other bedding with detergent in hot water at a minimum of 131°F weekly to kill dust mites and remove allergens. High water temperature can kill dust mites better than just using detergent. Also wash curtains. Set your washing machine to its hottest setting. If the water isn't hot enough, check your hot water heater. Most hot water heaters have an adjustable knob to change the maximum temperature. If you can't wash bedding in hot enough temperatures, throw them in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at a temperature above 130 °F to kill mites. Afterward, wash and dry the bedding so allergens are removed. You could also dry items in direct sunlight. Use a product that contains essential oils, like eucalyptus, cedar or tea tree oil to add to the wash's effectiveness. Using detergent plus bleach will remove most allergens and a significant amount of dust mites, even in cold or warm water. Items can be washed again to reduce mite levels further. Know that live mites can be transferred from mite-infested items to mite-free items during washing. Hot tumble dry items for an extra half an hour after drying or dry clean items to kill dust mites. This will not get rid of the allergen dust mites produce, however. Vacuum everything that you can, including couches, mattresses, armchairs, floors, mattresses and other places where people frequently sit or lay down on. To trap allergens effectively, your vacuum should have a double-layered microfilter bag or a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. This is important because it helps ensure that dust is not recirculated into the air. Vacuuming removes surface dust but can't remove most dust mites and dust mite allergens. Mites are tiny enough to pass through the vacuum cleaner bag. However, vacuuming keeps dust down so these areas aren't as attractive to mites. Get underneath and behind furniture to keep \\"dust bunnies\\" from forming. If you have severe allergies, leave the area being vacuumed and let someone else do the work. Stay away from the vacuumed room for about two hours to let everything settle. Keep your vacuum serviced so that it continues to work well. Use a water vacuum to keep mites inside the water container so you can dump the water into your toilet and flush it. You may wish to wear a mask when you vacuum to avoid inhaling allergens. Even if you don't have allergies, it's best to leave the house for about half an hour after vacuuming for the remaining dust and allergens to settle. Steam cleaning dissolves dirt and grime, removes germs from surfaces and kills dust mites. However, the moisture that accumulates in carpet padding from steam cleaning creates an ideal environment for dust mites. Think about using dry cleaning methods instead. Feather dusters and dry cloths will stir up allergens into the air. Use a damp or oiled mop, rag or electrostatic cloths to clean hard surfaces once a week. This will help keep dust and dust mites down. Whether you packed up clothing for a move or it's starting to get cold for winter, wash all these items before using them. Dust mites love to settle into the fibers of unused and unwashed clothing and blankets as they collect dust in storage. Washing them ensures that both mites and allergens are destroyed so you can enjoy your items sneeze-free.","completion":"Dead skin build-up in and around the bed attracts dust mites and allergens. To reduce this, wash bedding weekly in hot water (minimum 131°F) with detergent, and consider using products containing essential oils or bleach for added effectiveness. If washing in hot water isn't possible, use a dryer or sunlight exposure to kill mites before washing. Be aware that live mites can transfer during washing, so hot tumble dry or dry clean items to eliminate them. Vacuum all surfaces with a HEPA filter-equipped vacuum to minimize allergens, but be prepared to leave the area for some time after vacuuming. Steam cleaning can kill dust mites but may create a moist environment suitable for their growth, so consider dry cleaning instead. Use damp or oiled cleaning tools for hard surfaces weekly, and remember to wash stored clothing and blankets before use to eradicate mites and allergens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Start by combining the constant terms on the right-hand side of the equation: Step 1: 4943 * n - 33186 = -14410 + 94913 4943 * n - 33186 = 80503 Next, isolate the term with the variable (4943 * n) by adding 33186 to both sides: Step 2: 4943 * n - 33186 + 33186 = 80503 + 33186 4943 * n = 113689 Now that we have the term with the variable isolated, we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by 4943: Step 3: 4943 * n / 4943 = 113689 / 4943 n = 22.99798 Therefore, the solution to the equation is n ≈ 22.99798."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County. - Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden.

Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden. - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot. - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe. - The Gulf of Finland is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf. - Since the United States was recognized as an independent country in 1783, it first established diplomatic relations with Norway in 1818 when Jonathan Russell was accepted as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden and Norway. From 1814 to 1905, Sweden and Norway were in a personal union. Although each country was fully sovereign, they had a common foreign policy and diplomatic service. The United States Ambassador to Sweden thus was the US representative to Norway as well as Sweden. In 1905 Sweden and Norway peacefully separated and Norway continued to be an independent constitutional monarchy. On November 14, 1905, the US State Department instructed Ambassador Charles H. Graves to handle affairs for Sweden and Norway separately and the Ambassador was thus commissioned to Norway equally with Sweden, though he remained in Stockholm. - Charles Hinman \\"C. H.\\" Graves (August 14, 1839 October 7, 1928) was an American army officer, politician, and diplomat. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast.

It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - This is a list of Ambassadors of the United States to Finland. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region.

It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. - The United States Ambassador to Sweden serves as the official diplomatic representative of the President and the Government of the United States of America to the King and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden.

Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe.

However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938). - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework.

The Lions entered the game looking to sweep a season series from the Bears for the first time since 2007, and did so. Chicago scored on the game's opening possession when Jay Cutler capped a 65-yard drive with a 32-yard TD pass to Brandon Marshall. The Lions tied the game at 7 later in the first quarter when Matthew Stafford found Kris Durham in the back of the end zone with a 5-yard TD pass. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Stafford hit Calvin Johnson with a 4-yard TD pass to put the Lions up 14-7. The Bears narrowed the lead to one point with Robbie Gould field goals of 25 and 32 yards. With 2:22 left in the game, Stafford and Johnson connected again, this time on a 14-yard TD pass play, putting the Lions up 21-13. Josh McCown, who relieved an injured Cutler, led the Bears on a 74-yard TD drive, capped by an 11-yard pass to Brandon Marshall for the score. Needing a two-point conversion to tie the game, McCown's pass to Dante Rosario sailed out of the end zone, but Detroit's Willie Young was called for roughing the passer, giving the Bears another chance from the 1-yard line. The Bears attempted a rushing play for the conversion, but Nick Fairley tackled Matt Fort&#233; behind the line of scrimmage, ending the Bears hopes. Calvin Johnson's second touchdown reception of the game gave him 63 touchdown catches in his Lions career, surpassing Herman Moore's previous team record of 62.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ford, GM see Barrett-Jackson as great place to sell new cars Updated: 4:10 p.m. ET with stats on GM test drives. If you want to sell cars, you couldn't find a more receptive audience than the mostly middle-aged men prowling the auto auctions in Scottsdale this week. At least that's what Ford and General Motors think. Both have made big investments in showing off their latest models at the Barrett-Jackson auction, including a test-drive lot. Yesterday alone, Ford gave 400 test drives. And to attract a crowd, Ford had a promotion in which participants could drag race a pair of Mustangs tethered to dynos. Not to be outdone, GM signed up nearly 2,000 drivers through Friday to test drive one of its new models, such as a Chevrolet Equinox or Buick LaCrosse, then take a spin in a Chevrolet Corvette with a driving instructor at their side. \\"We want people to interact with our cars,\\" said Ford spokesman Robert Parker. And it pays off. Last year Ford's display resulted in sales of seven Mustang GT500KRs, some very expensive pony cars. Tim Stoehr, the sales operation manager for Ford in Phoenix, said he thinks at least three have been sold this year. Ford's president of the America's, Mark Fields, was due to attend today. GM design chief Ed Welburn arrived last night. The presence of both executives underscores how seriously automakers take the auctions. GM, for its part, was showing off the Chevrolet Volt and other models. Both automakers have their displays in a place where enthusiasts have to walk through them to get to the auction floor.

The masked word is a place through which the river flows from West (கிழக்கு நோக்கி translates as 'towards the west'). All the four options are names of places. On examining the sentences before and after the MASK, we can see that these places are listed in the order that the river flows through them. Option A: Vellalur (வெள்ளலூர்) - is already mentioned after the MASK, in the list of places, hence cannot be it. Option B: Kuniamuthur (குனியமுத்தூர்) - is also mentioned after the MASK in the list, hence this also cannot be it. Option D: Perur (பேரூர்) - is not mentioned anywhere in the statement. However, knowing that Perur is in the east of Coimbatore not in the western region which the river flows through, this can also be eliminated. Option C: Karur (கரூர்) - is mentioned at the end of the statement and it's the final place where the river merges with the Kaveri. But Karur is located east of Coimbatore, and here we are talking about the places which the river flows through from west. Since the statement is specifically mentioning places where the river flows from West of Coimbatore, logically we need a place name that falls to the west of Coimbatore.

Brush your teeth as if using a toothbrush: begin at the gums and work down, cleaning each individual tooth with a circular motion. Don’t forget to brush your tongue. Rinse your mouth thoroughly when done, swishing back and forth. Before there were toothbrushes, most people brushed their teeth with twigs. In many parts of the world, they still do, using twigs from oak, arak, or neem trees. Research shows that twigs from the arak tree contain natural fluoride and antimicrobial agents, and brushing with them is as or more effective as brushing with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Pick a young, flexible branch about 6 to 8 inches long (15 to 20 cm). You want one without real bark, only a thin skin. Peel the skin off and chew on one end of the stick until the fibers separate, turning the end into a little brush. Use it to brush your teeth. You can also use a toothpick to clean between teeth, but use caution so as not to hurt your gums and make them bleed. If no paper towels, washcloths, or twigs are at hand, you can always use your finger.

Usage: The story will have anywhere from 100 to 1000 words, giving enough space to provide a detailed and engaging narrative that also covers the ordered facts. Part #3: Include all the facts given as input in their order of appearance. Usage: In the story, each fact will appear in the order they were presented in the input, ensuring that the final narrative stays true to the original key points. Part #4: Expanding upon the facts to produce a broader, yet coherent, narrative. Usage: By adding more details, background information, and related events, the story will expand on the original key points to offer a complete and engaging narrative that remains consistent and coherent. For example, the story might explore the events leading up to Fact3 (Satyananda's path of righteousness) and describe how the men ended up in jail. Example Story: Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived two friends named Rama and Krishnulu. Although they were not related by blood, their friendship was so strong that it could only be described as a story of bond, not blood (Fact1). Rama was the son of a righteous man named Satyananda, who always upheld justice (Fact2). He was a respected judge in the village and never hesitated to make difficult decisions. Satyananda's unwavering commitment to the path of righteousness had its consequences (Fact3). One fateful day, a group of men who had been jailed by him decided to seek their revenge. They attacked his family, murdering Satyananda's beloved wife and daughter. The news shook the village, leaving everyone heartbroken and afraid. In the same village, there lived a young orphan named Mahesh (Fact4). He had lost his parents at a very young age and had to fend for himself. Never having experienced the love and care of a family, Mahesh was determined to help others in need. He would often steal food and other essentials from the wealthy people in the village and distribute them to the poor. However, Mahesh's actions eventually caught the attention of the same group of men that had murdered Satyananda's family. These men had also killed Mahesh's mother and sister, leaving him all alone in the world (Fact5). Initially, they wanted to kill Mahesh too, but upon learning about his stealing from the wealthy to feed the poor, they formed a twisted sense of respect for him and decided to let him live. Time went on, and Rama, devastated by the loss of his mother and sister, decided to bring the murderers to justice. With the help of his loyal friend Krishnulu, they started gathering evidence against the group of men. Meanwhile, Mahesh continued his Robin Hood-esque endeavors, helping the poor in the village and keeping himself safe from the savage men. As his reputation grew, the villagers began looking up to him as a hero. Rama and Krishnulu, recognizing Mahesh's noble intentions, decided to join forces with him in their quest for justice. Together, they worked tirelessly to ensure that the murderers were brought to trial and faced the consequences of their heinous actions. The combined efforts of Rama, Krishnulu, and Mahesh led to the arrest and conviction of the group of men, bringing peace and justice back to their village. Thus, the story of Rama, Krishnulu, and Mahesh became a legendary tale of friendship and the power of righteousness. Their bond, not by blood but by their shared values and love for their village, had transformed the fate of everyone who lived there. Their bravery and commitment to justice would inspire generations to come, ensuring that their story would never be forgotten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Step 1: Gather Ingredients and Tools To make a cold cut sandwich, you will need a variety of ingredients. These include: - Bread of your choice (whole grain, white, rye, etc.) - Cold cuts of your choice (turkey, ham, roast beef, etc.) - Cheese of your choice (cheddar, swiss, provolone, etc.) - Condiments of your choice (mayonnaise, mustard, etc.) - Vegetables of your choice (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, etc.) - A knife to cut your ingredients and spread the condiments - A cutting board It's crucial to have all of these ingredients and tools ready before you start. This will make the assembling process quicker and more efficient. Step 2: Prepare the Bread Take out two slices of bread and place them on your cutting board. The bread serves as the base of your sandwich, encasing all of the other ingredients. If you want, you can lightly toast your bread to add extra flavor and texture. Step 3: Spread the Condiments Using your knife, spread your selected condiments (like mayonnaise and/or mustard) onto one or both of your slices of bread. This step adds flavor to your sandwich. The condiments also act as a sealant to prevent the bread from getting soggy. Step 4: Add the Cold Cuts Place your chosen cold cuts on one piece of bread. The amount is up to you, but typically, two to three slices are used. This protein will be the main flavor component of your sandwich. Step 5: Add the Cheese Place your cheese on top of the cold cuts. The cheese is another key flavor component and can also help to hold the sandwich together. Step 6: Add the Vegetables Place your chosen vegetables on top of the cheese. This can include lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Adding vegetables to your sandwich provides key nutrients, adds refreshing crunch, and helps to balance out the heavier flavors of the cold cuts and cheese. Step 7: Put the Sandwich Together Place the second piece of bread on top of the stack of ingredients. Press down lightly to ensure everything stays together. Step 8: Cut the Sandwich Using a knife, cut your sandwich in half or in quarters, whichever you prefer. This makes the sandwich easier to eat and also allows you to see all your layers of ingredients. Now your cold cut sandwich is ready to be served. This kind of sandwich is versatile, easy to make, and handy for quick meals or to-go lunches. You can customize it to your preferences, making it a sandwich you'll always enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Wieder ein Talent auf dem Chartgrill verheizt . Grundgütiger, bei Lisa Bund wäre doch nun wirklich Zeit gewesen, in Ruhe ein Album heranreifen zu lassen, dass ihrer Stimme und Ausstrahlung angemessen ist. Stattdessen bekommt sie ein Album von der Stange, bei dem jeder Ton pure Berechnung ist. Offenbar lag die Schublade \\"Kelly Clarkson\\" am nächsten zum vorbereiteten Image, also bekommt sie soften amerikanischen Radiorock mit glatten Gitarren und Refrains aus der Klonfabrik. Es bleibt ein pelziger Geschmack von angestaubtem Achtziger-Rock a la Bonnie Tailer, Heart oder Cher, zumeist bräsig aufgemotzt und mit schlaffen Drums umterlegt. Das ganze zieht dermaßen lustlos an einem vorbei, dass man in Gedanken schon die Alben von Pink oder Avril Lavigne in der Hand hat (denn beide werden ausgiebig nachgeäfft.) Wie schon bei Monrose bleibt zwischen all dem Produktionsbling kaum Platz für die Stimme, die hier langweilige Melodien für Millionen zu Gehör bringt. Also ist der erste Stern für Ihre Stimme, der zweite dafür, \\"Flugzeuge im Bauch\\" mit auf das Album zu nehmen. Bleibt zu hoffen, dass sie mit dem Album soviel Geld verdient, dass sie beim nächsten Mal die rauhe, ehrliche und verletzliche Platte macht, die uns ihre Stimme längst versprochen hat.

As the text is in German, I will first translate it to English using a reliable translator, and I will try to perceive the general tone of the review. Translation: They have wasted yet another talent on the charts. God, it would really have been time to let Lisa Bund's album mature in peace, which would have been appropriate for her voice and charisma. Instead, she gets an off-the-rack album where every note is a pure calculation. Apparently, the \\"Kelly Clarkson\\" drawer was the closest to the prepared image, so she gets soft American radio rock with smooth guitars and choruses from the clone factory.

The whole thing passes by so listlessly that you already have the albums of Pink or Avril Lavigne in mind (both are extensively mocked.) As with Monrose, there is hardly any room for the voice amid all the production bling, here it brings boring melodies for millions to listen to.

Hennig was cast in the role of Stephanie Johnson, and it is a contract role, which means that Hennig has a contractual agreement with the show's producers to portray this character for a specified period or under certain conditions. In the second sentence: \\"On April 20, 2007, Stephanie Johnson joined the cast of \`Days of Our Lives' in the contract role of Hennig.\\" This sentence tells us that a character named \\"Stephanie Johnson\\" joined the cast of \\"Days of Our Lives\\" on April 20, 2007. Instead of Hennig being the actor's name, it is described as the role's name in this sentence. This suggests that Stephanie Johnson is playing the role of Hennig under a contractual agreement.

Available options: [I] No; [II] Yes; Answer:","completion":"Option I: No The suggested answer appears to be incomplete and does not adequately address the given question. The provided answer addresses the removal process of waxing but does not provide any information about the duration of the results. A more appropriate answer would be as follows: A back waxing procedure, which involves removing hair from the back using wax, will provide varying results depending on the individual's hair growth cycle, hair type, and other factors. On average, the results of back waxing can last anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks. However, this duration may vary among individuals and can be affected by factors such as the person's genetics, hormones, and lifestyle. It is essential to note that hair growth is typically slower following a waxing procedure, and the hair that grows back may appear finer and less noticeable. Regular waxing may also lead to a more prolonged duration between sessions as the hair growth may slow down over time. However, the duration within which a person needs to have their back waxed again can vary and is ultimately dependent on their personal preferences and hair growth patterns. In summary, the results of a back waxing last on average from 4 to 6 weeks, depending on various factors, such as the individual's hair growth cycle, hair type, genetics, and lifestyle.

He deliberately cuts his cheek and then hands the blade to his son Amsterdam, who is about to wipe off the blood. Vallon tells him to leave it there, and his son puts away the blade in a black pouch with a sliver cross clasp. Vallon then says a prayer to St. Michael, puts a medallion over Amsterdam's head, grabs a steel cross, and marches out of his cave with Amsterdam. They walk past people making and finishing weapons, including a woman with clawed gloves named Hellcat Maggie. Vallon, his son, and the rest take communion as they continue exiting the caves. They finally reach the top level of an old brewery. They stop and Vallon asks a man named Monk if he will join them. Monk says he'll fight for pay. Vallon promises him ten dollars for every \\"new notch\\" on his club, so Monk agrees, picks up his wooden club, and kicks open the door, revealing a snow-covered intersection known as Paradise Square, the Five Points of Lower Manhattan.Vallon and his crew, the Dead Rabbits, leave the brewery and make their way onto the street.

Vallon recants that it's a free country, that he and his immigrant crowd have been harassed incessantly by Bill and his men.

A fluffy kitten, spotted piglet and duckling all exit the box one by one to the surprise of the family. The 60-second video clip from McVitie's stars adorable puppies, kittens, a hedgehog, piglet and a reindeer. Created by Grey London, the advert features the McVitie's Victoria biscuit selection before a host of animals appear from the blue pack. It is the first Christmas advert created by the biscuit company in more than 30 years and will air for the first time today (Thursday, 4 4) at 7.42pm on E4. The group of cute creatures includes an Alaskan malamute puppy, piglet, Persian kitten, rabbit, duckling, ginger kitten, pug puppy and a baby hedgehog. Along with a reindeer calf and even a narwhal - a tusked whale - all the animals emerge from the box. An adorable malamute puppy clambers up the armchair in an attempt to wake up the snoozing granddad. Tangled up in Santa's hat, the spotted piglet is just one of the many baby animals appearing in the advert.

Article: The London Underground (The Tube) The main source of public transport in London revolves around the Underground (or the Tube as it is known to Londoners). This network of 12 lines can get you to most places in the center of the city quickly. It's most necessary to get an Oyster Card or a Travelcard. Single tickets are priced starting at the intentionally absurd price of PS 4.80 (Zone 1-3), if you pay cash. Using an Oyster card, a single fare is PS 2.30 if you are traveling within the central Zone 1. On hot days it is also advisable to take a bottle of water with you as Underground trains are not air-conditioned. Last trains leave central London at around 00:30 weekdays, 23:30 Sundays. First trains leave the suburbs at around 5:00. The Bus System Outside the center of London, Tube stations are farther apart, so buses help fill the gaps. Also, the bus offers a cheaper alternative, even if it is a slower journey. Cash fares for London buses have been abolished -- you cannot pay cash. A bus fare costs PS 1.50 if using only buses, the fare is capped at PS 4.40 per day for Oyster or contactless users. River Services There are a number of different routes along the River Thames. The faster commuter services operate all day from Greenwich Pier to Embankment and from Putney and Chelsea harbour to Blackfriars during Peak Hours only. These routes will pass a number of places of interest including the Houses of Parliament and London Bridge. A return fare from Putney to Blackfriars will cost about 12 pounds. National Rail Once you leave Central London or if you are traveling South of the River Thames, the best public transport option will often be National Rail. There are numerous connections to the Rail System from the Tube. Travelcards can be used for travel on the National Rail (but not the Heathrow Express). Oyster cards can be used up to Zone 6 except certain services including Heathrow Express, Heathrow Connect and HSI. Question: When taking the London Underground, _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"It is advisable to have an Oyster Card or Travelcard as single tickets are more expensive.

The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent. Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of character became central to religious unity in Reformed churches?","completion":"In simple words, for Reformed churches, religious unity was about believing in Jesus Christ and having faith in Him.

What type of publication does Len Deighton and Margaret Landon have in common? Answer:","completion":"Len Deighton and Margaret Landon are both well-known authors who have made significant contributions to the world of literature. Their works mainly fall into the fiction genre, and their most popular works have become enduring classics. The type of publication that they both have in common is the novel. Len Deighton, born in 1929, is a British author best known for his spy novels. His writing career spans over five decades, and he is considered an important figure in the development of espionage and thriller fiction. Deighton has written numerous novels, including his famous \\"Harry Palmer\\" series – the first of which was \\"The IPCRESS File\\" (1962) – and standalone novels like \\"Bomber\\" (1970). His works are characterized by meticulous attention to detail, well-researched background information, and complex but engaging narratives. Margaret Landon, born in 1903 and passed away in 1993, was an American writer who wrote the popular historical novel \\"Anna and the King of Siam\\" (1944). This novel was a fictionalized retelling of the experiences of Anna Leonowens, a British governess who served at the court of King Mongkut of Siam during the 19th century. The book was immensely popular and became a bestseller upon publication and was later adapted into Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical \\"The King and I\\" in 1951. Both Deighton and Landon have written novels that have captivated readers around the world and, in different ways, have contributed to reflecting broader truths about human nature, society, and history through their works of fiction. The type of publication they both share — the novel — showcases their prowess as storytellers and ensures that their works continue to resonate with contemporary audiences.

Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.

Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.

Q: Title: Good but hard to put on Review: I offered my mother these compression stockings given that she is always standing and complains about her legs aching. Her legs feel so much better now but she did mention they were hard to put on. The open toe ones cut the circulation to her toes (I ordered some closed toe ones the second time around). It's too bad I couldn't find them for the same price though, hope it doesn't go up every time I will have to order her some. Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"This product review can be considered a mixed review as it consists of both positive and negative aspects of the product. The reviewer details their experience with purchasing and using the compression stockings, focusing on two main aspects: the effectiveness of the product, and the ease of use. On the positive side, the reviewer notes that the compression stockings have significantly helped their mother's legs feel better, indicating that the product has achieved its intended purpose and has been effective in providing relief from the leg pain experienced due to their mother's occupation of standing for long hours. However, the review also mentions some issues and limitations with the product. The first issue is the difficulty experienced in putting the stockings on. Compression stockings are generally tight-fitting to provide the necessary compression, which can make application more challenging. Nevertheless, this can be seen as a drawback for users who may struggle with the application process. The second issue the reviewer brings up is related to the open-toe design, as they found it to cut off circulation to their mother's toes. As such, they had to order a different version of the product (closed-toe stockings) to address this problem. It is worth noting that this issue might be specific to the reviewer's mother and might not be relevant to all users. Lastly, the reviewer expresses concern about the price of the product, since they could not find the closed-toe version at the same price as the open-toe version they purchased earlier. The anticipation of potential price changes in the future adds an element of uncertainty to their overall satisfaction with the product. In conclusion, while the effectiveness of the product is praised and appreciated, the review also highlights some concerns regarding the stockings' usability, design, and pricing. Thus, this product review can be classified as mixed, as it consists of both positive feedback on the product's effectiveness and negative aspects related to user experience and potential future pricing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To do this, we calculate the difference between the length of the list and the value of i. In this case, we have i = 1 and len(A) = 3, so the index we need to slice the list at would be: index = len(A) - i index = 3 - 1 index = 2 Step 3: Slice the list and return the result Now that we know the index to slice the list, we can slice the list and obtain the elements preceding the last i elements. result = A[:index] result = A[:2] So, the result will be the slice of A from the start of the list until the index, i.e., ['T', '201']. In this case, we have removed the last i (1) element from A, thus completing the task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1950s, Szigeti began to develop arthritis in his hands and his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for \\"Long live Hungary!\\"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that \\"Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed\\".Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness. He died in Lucerne, Switzerland on February 19, 1973, at the age of 80. The New York Times ran a front-page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist Yehudi Menuhin: We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos, aristocrats as human beings and as musicians, has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who had weakened technical mastery due to arthritis in his hands during the 1950s, but continued to draw large audiences to his concerts, is Szigeti. This person is Joseph Szigeti, a renowned violinist who continued his musical career despite his health issues, and later devoted himself to teaching after his official retirement from performing in 1960."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In which sport was Graeme Obree briefly world record holder in 1993, only to lose it to another Briton shortly afterwards? Answer:","completion":"Graeme Obree was briefly the world record holder in 1993 in the sport of cycling, specifically in the Individual Pursuit discipline. Born in Scotland in 1965, Obree rose to prominence in the early 1990s as a professional cyclist with a knack for innovation and unconventional approaches to bicycle design and riding techniques. The particular milestone in which Obree set the world record occurred on July 17, 1993, during the World Cycling Championships in Hamar, Norway. Obree broke the world record for the 4,000m individual pursuit event, posting a stunning time of 4 minutes, 22.668 seconds. His innovative approach and unusual riding style, with hands tucked tightly into his chest to minimize air resistance, earned him the nickname \\"The Flying Scotsman.\\" However, Obree's reign as the world record holder was short-lived, as another British cyclist, Chris Boardman, reclaimed the title just six days later on July 23, 1993. Boardman, who also had a penchant for pushing the limits of cycling technology, completed the same distance in an astounding time of 4 minutes, 20.894 seconds. The rivalry between Obree and Boardman made headlines throughout the cycling world at that time, and the two competitors continued to push each other to greater heights of cycling achievement in the years that followed. Their ongoing duel led to further refinements in the sport's technology and techniques, which ultimately benefited the entire cycling community. Graeme Obree's innovative spirit, dedication to his craft, and determination to push the boundaries of conventional cycling wisdom helped the sport of cycling to advance and reach new levels of performance. Although his time as a world record holder was brief, his impact on the sport remains significant and enduring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Monica, on the other hand, was tired of her little sister's constant need for attention. But this time, as Christine kept hounding her, Monica noticed that the desperation in her sister's eyes was different from the usual. It seemed more urgent, laced with a hint of sadness and fear. As the siblings sat down across from each other in the living room, they began to talk. Christine hesitated for a moment, her lips quivering with emotion. Gathering her courage, she finally spoke, \\"Monica, I have to tell you something. I've been really scared and I don't know what to do.\\" Immediately, Monica felt concern and a deep sense of responsibility swell within her. She reached out to hold Christine's hands, her stern demeanor softening. \\"What's wrong, Christine? You can tell me anything,\\" she comforted her sister, anxious to help. Christine took a deep breath and told Monica about the strange experiences she'd been having recently. After moving into her new apartment three months prior, Christine began to feel an eerie presence, as if someone was watching her. It started with quiet whispers in her ears when she was alone in the apartment, followed by strange noises in the night that sounded like footsteps pacing in circles. But the scariest part was the dark figure that she saw every night in her dreams, looming over her bed with a suffocating sense of dread, paralyzing her as she slept. As she recounted her tale, Christine's face was etched with fear, the pain of sleepless nights and the constant burden of dread making her life a living nightmare. Monica's heart ached for her little sister, not knowing how to solve this terrifying situation. Utilizing her problem-solving nature, Monica set out to help Christine confront her fears. She started to do research on paranormal activity, hauntings and sleep paralysis to try to understand Christine's experiences. She also reached out to her group of friends, some of whom had similar experiences, to gather advice on overcoming these supernatural occurrences. To alleviate Christine's fear of being alone in her apartment, Monica invited her to stay with her for a few weeks. Together, they tackled the overwhelming fear that gripped Christine each night, Monica comforting her sister whenever she woke up from terrible dreams or restless sleep. During the day, the sisters sought support from each other and specialist groups, ensuring that Christine underwent an extensive spiritual and psychological healing process. They visited trusted counselors and psychologists to remove anxiety and stress from her life. Monica took the initiative to contact paranormal investigators, who helped discover the source of the haunting experiences and effectively confront the presence in the apartment. Through patience, dedication, and teamwork, Monica was able to successfully guide her sister through the harrowing ordeal, expelling the darkness that had taken hold of her life. As Christine regained her sense of security and freedom, their bond became stronger than ever. The sleepless nights and echoing dread were replaced with laughter and the warmth of familial love. Their relationship was no longer just about the older sister being chased for her affection and attention, but about the sisterly love and support that conquered fear and brought light to the darkness. Christine would always be grateful for Monica's unwavering support and dedication to saving her from her living nightmare, and Monica saw her little sister in a new light – a resilient young woman who faced her fears head on and emerged stronger than ever. As Christine and Monica sat together in their living room, the warmth of the golden sun casting their shadows on the colorful carpet, they knew they had faced something terrifying and had come out on the other side not only unbroken but stronger and more united than ever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Neatly sandwiched between THE STRANGER, a small film noir picture that proved Welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties, and MACBETH, a no-budget Shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days, comes THE LADY FROM SHANGAI, a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of Wellesian mythos that covers THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, MR. ARKADIN and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses. Six years after THE MALTESE FALCON, with the post-war craze of the film noir in full swing, Welles, always ahead of his time, a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity, envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker, more sinister, paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time. It's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time, to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor, and it was once again Europe that championed it as another Welles classic. Certain set-pieces stand out. The aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows, and of course the Funhouse/Hall of Mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of Wellesian bravura as any in CITIZEN KANE or THE TRIAL. The only faults I find with the movie is Welles' ill-advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act. The story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner, which the cuts only serve to intensify. I believe the heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter. Welles would exile himself in Europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic, the monumental TOUCH OF EVIL, perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time. Shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for Hollywood's premiere star of the time, Rita Hayworth, ought to have been, and Welles marriage with Hayworth ended before the movie was even released. Sixty years later and one hour of footage less, Shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover. Surely that must count for something.

Q:Information: - Anampses is a genus of wrasses native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans . - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\". - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.

Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, asserts that, due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future.

What is the answer for the question: What was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism? from the following article ? At this point Lissitzky subscribed fully to suprematism and, under the guidance of Malevich, helped further develop the movement. In 1919–1920 Lissitzky was a head of Architectural department at the People's Art School where with his students, primarily Lazar Khidekel, he was working on transition from plane to volumetric suprematism. Lissitzky designed On the New System of Art by Malevich, who responded in December 1919: \\"Lazar Markovich, I salute you on the publication of this little book\\". Perhaps the most famous work by Lissitzky from the same period was the 1919 propaganda poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge\\". Russia was going through a civil war at the time, which was mainly fought between the \\"Reds\\" (communists, socialists and revolutionaries) and the \\"Whites\\" (monarchists, conservatives, liberals and other socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution). The image of the red wedge shattering the white form, simple as it was, communicated a powerful message that left no doubt in the viewer's mind of its intention. The piece is often seen as alluding to the similar shapes used on military maps and, along with its political symbolism, was one of Lissitzky's first major steps away from Malevich's non-objective suprematism into a style his own. He stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\"In January 17, 1920, Malevich and Lissitzky co-founded the short-lived Molposnovis (Young followers of a new art), a proto-suprematist association of students, professors, and other artists. After a brief and stormy dispute between \\"old\\" and \\"young\\" generations, and two rounds of renaming, the group reemerged as UNOVIS (Exponents of the new art) in February.

The poster's design, which alluded to the shapes used on military maps and contained strong political symbolism, marked a departure from Malevich's pure abstraction and represented a distinct stylistic shift for Lissitzky. This development allowed him to explore new ways of visual expression, as he stated: \\"The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not a recognizable form of anything that is already finished, already made, or already existent in the world – it is a symbol of a new world, which is being built upon and which exists by the way of the people.\\" Through this new approach, Lissitzky began establishing his own artistic identity, distinct from the ideals of Malevich's suprematism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sled worked better in the snow than the toboggan, because the Select from: (A). toboggan had a sticky bottom.; (B). sled had a sticky bottom.;","completion":"The sled worked better in the snow than the toboggan, because the toboggan had a sticky bottom. While this might not seem like a significant issue at first, the sticky bottom plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of each of these two snow vehicles. Let's explore the factors contributing to this difference and discuss various aspects of the sled and the toboggan and their implications on their effectiveness in the snow. A toboggan is a traditional form of a sled, generally used for leisurely pursuits during the winter season. They are constructed using different materials, such as wood or plastic, and have a flat, low-profile design, providing stability and balance to its riders. When a toboggan has a sticky bottom, its ability to slide smoothly on snow is vastly hindered. The sticky surface of the bottom slows down the movement because it increases the friction between the toboggan and the snow. As a result, the ones on the toboggan might find themselves struggling to gain momentum and speed on the slopes. Additionally, the sticky surface can cause the snow to accumulate and clump underneath the toboggan, further increasing the resistance and effort required for the riders to experience the fun of snow sliding. This might create a tiresome and frustrating experience for those who seek a thrilling ride. On the other hand, a sled, especially one with a non-sticky or slick bottom, is designed for optimal performance on snow. Sleds are typically equipped with runners, which are thin, curved metal or wooden rails that help to elevate the sled above the snow. These runners enable the sled to glide effortlessly on snow, providing relatively low friction and allowing for a swift and smooth sliding experience. The sled's design accommodates various sitting or lying positions and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Sleds with a non-sticky bottom are superior to toboggans with sticky bottoms in numerous ways. Firstly, they provide greater control, allowing users to steer, maneuver, and adjust their sled to suit their individual preferences and comfort. The slick surface ensures smooth movement, swifter speeds, and maximized enjoyment on the slopes. Sleds can tackle varying terrains, from icy surfaces to powdery snow, offering a versatile and exciting experience that can be customized depending on the user's skill level. In conclusion, the sled's enhanced performance in the snow compared to the toboggan with a sticky bottom is attributed to the sled's runners, non-sticky surface, and versatile design. When the toboggan has a sticky bottom, it fails to provide the thrilling and smooth snow sliding experience many individuals seek. In contrast, sleds cater to a wide range of skill levels and snow conditions, making them a clear favorite for winter adventurers and sliding enthusiasts alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim acquitted in sodomy trial REPORTING FROM NEW DELHI –- In an unexpected conclusion to a controversial two-year trial, a Malaysian court Monday acquitted opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on sodomy charges, ruling that the DNA evidence submitted by the prosecution was unreliable. Sodomy, even between consenting adults, is illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia although few people are prosecuted. Anwar, who faced up to 20 years in prison for allegedly having sex with a former aide, has repeatedly maintained his innocence, terming the charges politically motivated. Malaysia's information minister said Monday in a statement that the verdict in the case showed that the Southeast Asian nation's judiciary was free from government interference. As news of the verdict spread, cheers erupted among Anwar's supporters, opposition politicians and his wife and daughters, many of whom raised their fists in the air. \\"Thank God justice has prevailed,\\" Anwar, 64, told journalists outside the courtroom amid heavy security. \\"To be honest, I am a little surprised.\\" The allegations against Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, were raised shortly after 2008 elections saw the opposition make sizable gains against the ruling United Malays National Organization party, in power for the last 50 years. This was the second sodomy trial against Anwar, who was beaten and jailed for six years in another case widely seen as politically motivated. National elections are due by 2013, although analysts expect they'll be called later this year. Minutes after the verdict, a message from Anwar's Twitter account read: \\"In the coming election, voice of the people will be heard and this corrupt government will be toppled from its pedestals of power.\\" Holy koalas!

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Christina Maria Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, reality show personality and television personality. Born in Staten Island, New York and raised in Rochester and Wexford, Pennsylvania, she appeared on the television series Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club in her early years. After recording \\"Reflection\\", the theme for Disney's 1998 film Mulan, Aguilera signed with RCA Records. She rose to prominence with her 1999 self-titled debut album that spawned the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \\"Genie in a Bottle\\", \\"What a Girl Wants\\", and \\"Come On Over Baby When planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth. She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \\"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\\". For the album, Aguilera served as executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs. The album was preceded by the single \\"Dirrty\\", which was released to shed Aguilera's teen pop image and express her sexuality and aggression. Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting various sexual fetishes and concepts. Aguilera's new image presented in the video started to overshadow her music, generating widespread criticism from both her peers including Shakira and Jessica Simpson and the public. Aguilera defended her new image, explaining that \\"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\\" The final cut of Stripped incorporated various genres from flamenco and R&B to rock and lyrically revolved around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality. It was released in October 2002 to mixed critical reviews; Jancee Dunn from the Rolling Stone praised Aguilera's vocals yet panned the album for its lack of musical concentration. The album was nonetheless a commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the United States. It was a major success in the United Kingdom, having sold 2 million copies and became the second highest-selling album by a female US artist of the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me. Stripped has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album was followed by four singles, \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", and \\"The Voice Within\\". \\"Beautiful\\" received universal acclaim for positive portrayal of the LGBT community and was the album's most commercially successful single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It earned Aguilera a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song was later listed at number 52 among the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s by the Rolling Stone in 2011. During the promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings. She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified, before embarking on her solo The Stripped Tour until December. Aguilera garnered media attention after attending the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Hollywood\\". Later that year, she was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won an award for Best Female. Billboard also announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two days before Christmas, the alleged smuggler apparently thought Easter eggs would be the perfect ploy to conceal 14 pounds of cocaine. It didn't work. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers sensed something was a little off with candy for the wrong holiday, a spokeswoman said. \\"That's certainly an anomaly, isn't it? They're trained to detect anomalies in all kinds of situations,\\" said Lee Harty, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \\"It's an unusual concealment method -- at least for this time of year. Maybe not for spring.\\" Esteban Galtes, 23, of Miami, Florida, was being held without bail being set Monday after he asked a federal court in Los Angeles to continue his Monday hearing until Wednesday, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice. Galtes' attorney could not be reached for comment Monday evening. \\"But cocaine camouflaged as","completion":"Easter eggs were not enough to fool the vigilant customs officers who carefully examined the suspicious shipment. Upon closer inspection, the officers discovered inconsistencies in the textures and weights of the festive candy, raising further suspicion. These observations, coupled with the unusual timing of the delivery, prompted the authorities to initiate a thorough investigation of the package's contents. The customs team proceeded to dismantle the Easter eggs, carefully removing the layers of packaging, only to unveil the cunningly concealed cocaine hidden within. The contraband was exquisitely hidden, with a great deal of effort exerted in ensuring that the colorful eggs emulated the exterior of regular, innocent candy. But ultimately, these elaborate attempts to deceive the seasoned law enforcement professionals proved futile. Once the cocaine was discovered and Galtes' involvement confirmed, he was promptly arrested and charged with various counts of drug smuggling and trafficking. His arrest highlights the ongoing determination and tireless efforts of customs and border protection officers in thwarting smuggling attempts, even those employing the most inventive and unorthodox concealment methods. Galtes now faces a lengthy legal process, and if convicted, could receive a hefty sentence due to the magnitude of the crime and the street value of the narcotics involved. The investigation into the smuggling operation is set to continue, as more individuals and criminal networks potentially linked to this drug trafficking attempt may be uncovered. This case serves as a cautionary tale of the relentless commitment and keen eye of customs and border protection officials, reiterating their role as the frontline guardians against drug smuggling and reinforcing their relentless pursuit of justice.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: The question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a \\"bad\\" movie? My husband and I picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words \\"Vestron Pictures\\" on it (Vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since I first acquired the legendary films \\"Suburbia\\" and \\"Class of 1984\\"). We were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was. Your basic plot as is follows: Grange, this goombaesque thug from planet Earth, robs \\"the bank of the Moon\\" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite and other minerals. The \\"governor\\" of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with. Then there's the nameless \\"Colonel\\", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare. Much of the movie centers around \\"futuristic\\" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides) with explosions galore. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of those other dusty Inland Empire outposts. But what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands of the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. I can't even remember the names of the bands (they're listed in the credits) other than Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I'd heard of before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely looking into them. Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the review - The question about whether this movie can be considered bad - They bought it at a cheap price - Mention of Vestron Pictures - Basic plot summary - Futuristic car chases - Awesome soundtrack featuring several LA punk bands of the mid-80s - Recommended way to enjoy the movie Step 2: Analyze the sentiment of each element - The question about the movie being bad seems to be rhetorical, as the reviewer goes on to describe it as entertaining.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions. It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating, and which are to be avoided; when to attack and when to run away. The animal is, in fact, playing a complicated and potentially dangerous game with its environment, discomfort or destruction. This is a difficult and unpleasant business and few animals would survive if they had to start from the beginning and learn about the world wholly by trial and error, for there are too many possible decisions which would prove fatal. So we find, in practice, that the game is always arranged in favor of the young animal in one way or another. Either the animal is protected during the early stages of its learning about the world around it, or the knowledge of which way to respond is built into its nervous system from the start. The fact that animals behave sensibly can be attributed partly to what we might call genetic learning, to distinguish it from individual learning that an animal does in the cause of its own life time. Genetic learning is learning by a species as a whole, and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to behave in the right way. However, genetic learning depends upon a prediction that the future will more or less exactly resemble the past. The more variable individual experience is likely to be, the less efficient is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game. It is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning. In the great majority of animals, behavior is a compound of individual experience added to the action patterns animals are born with.That is why animals can survive.

He was found not far from the city of Umea in the north of Sweden by snowmobilers who thought they had come across a ruined car until they dug their way to a window and saw movement inside.

Mientras tanto, se ha iniciado una demanda penal por los hechos violentos, así como la toma de la Torre de Rectoría, que en 2007 fue declarada por la Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura como Patrimonio Cultural de la Humanidad. Los jóvenes afirman no haber tomado la Rectoría, sino \\"estar haciendo un plantón\\". El domingo, 74 directores de facultades, escuelas, institutos y centros de la UNAM la liberación de la Torre.

According to the myth, Orpheus descended into the underworld and enchanted the gods with his music, convincing them to allow Eurydice to return to the living world.

Ensuring that each section of hair is neatly separated and free from tangles, the stylist works diligently to create a harmonious blend of waves, curls, or added volume, depending on the client's preferences and hair type. To maintain the highest level of precision, the stylist may use various tools, such as a fine-toothed comb to smooth out the hair strands and ensure even distribution. They might also use hair clips to keep unrolled sections organized and out of the way, preventing any unintentional interference with the ongoing roller placements. Throughout the process, they constantly assess the hair's texture, elasticity, and thickness, adjusting their technique accordingly. Once all of the rollers have been installed, the stylist moves on to the next step in the styling process, which often involves setting the hair. This can be done in a few different ways, such as applying a setting lotion, mousse, or gel to the hair before blow-drying it on a low heat setting or placing the client under a hair dryer. The use of heat is essential in activating and locking in the curl pattern, ensuring lasting results. As the client waits for their hair to set, the stylist may check in periodically, using a gentle touch to assess whether the curls are forming as desired. If necessary, they may adjust the temperature or duration of the drying process, or even tweak the placement of rollers, to enhance the final outcome. The stylist also uses this time to clean and organize their workstation, ensuring that all tools and supplies are neatly arranged and ready for the next phase. Once the appropriate amount of time has passed, and the stylist is confident that the client's hair is fully set, they carefully begin the process of unraveling the rollers. Emphasizing a delicate touch to avoid disrupting or damaging the newly-formed curls and waves, they slowly remove each roller, one by one. As each section of hair is released, the stylist may use their fingers or a wide-toothed comb to gently separate and shape the curls, creating the desired level of volume and bounce. Finally, the stylist applies a lightweight finishing product, such as a serum, hairspray, or pomade, to seal in the style and provide added definition, flexibility, and shine. They also provide the client with professional advice on how to maintain and refresh their new hairstyle at home, along with personalized product recommendations tailored to their specific needs. With a final evaluation and any necessary touch-ups, the stylist presents their completed work to the client, eagerly awaiting their reaction and feedback. Through their careful attention to detail, vast knowledge of hair textures and styling techniques, and clear communication with the client, the stylist has successfully transformed their client's hair into the desired look, leaving them feeling both confident and beautiful."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Many people who have a chance to use the Internet at school, home, and work. They use the Internet for no other purposes than to send or receive emails. It's all very easy. You prepare the message, log onto the Internet, and send it. The message first goes to your Internet Service Provider's mail server, which in turn sends it to the recipient's mail server. On the way your message may go through several servers, each reading the name in order to send it to the right server. The message then remains in the recipient's mail email server until he requests it by \\"checking his mail\\". The benefits of emails are obvious: mostly it's quick. Also, many people feel that the rules for regular mails don't apply to email, making it less formal, which in turn make email easier to write and send. It's not just friends and coworkers that are receiving emails. Wherever you look, the Web is providing email addresses. This has made communication between strangers easier than ever. You can read an interesting article online and immediately send the author an email. Anyone who posts his email address on a Web page is saying he wants to receive email. There are places you can go if you don't know someone's email address. Check out Bigfoot, the Internet Address Finder, or Netscape's Email Directories for more information.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

In this story, the biggest problem Neighborhood Legal Services is facing is the language barrier. A lot of the people they are trying to help speak different languages, especially Asian languages.

In this review, the customer provides several reasons that indicate their dissatisfaction with the product. Firstly, the title of the review itself, \\"Cheap and broken,\\" suggests a negative perspective on the quality and condition of the item. The customer further expresses their disappointment by detailing the issue they experienced: the sizing button was broken upon arrival, with the button falling off and the spring popping out simply by touching it. This instance highlights that the product was not durable or well-made, contributing to a poor experience for the customer. Additionally, the customer mentions that the product was \\"cheaply made,\\" which signifies their belief that the item was not manufactured with high-quality materials or craftsmanship. This further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the overall quality of the product and their perception of its value for money. The fact that the customer chose to return the product and request a refund is perhaps the most definitive indication of their dissatisfaction. This action demonstrates that the customer felt the item did not meet their expectations and was not worth keeping, leading them to seek a refund to resolve the issue. In conclusion, the customer's negative feedback regarding the broken sizing button, the perceived low quality of the product, and their decision to return the item for a refund all indicate a sense of dissatisfaction with their purchase.

Some historians argue that Napoleon III also sought war, particularly for the diplomatic defeat in 1866 in leveraging any benefits from the Austro-Prussian War, and he believed he would win a conflict with Prussia. They also argue that he wanted a war to resolve growing domestic political problems. Other historians, notably French historian Pierre Milza, dispute this. On 8 May 1870, shortly before the war, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869.

Mary could afford a nice meal. Mary had been planning the perfect night out to impress Rachel for quite some time. Ever since her promotion at work, she finally felt comfortable splurging on a special evening together. She wanted to treat Rachel to the finer things, and after extensive research and recommendations from her well-to-do colleagues, she decided on the upscale restaurant, \\"La Fleur Eternelle.\\" Upon arrival, Mary swooped open the car door for Rachel, and the two strolled toward the luxurious entrance of La Fleur Eternelle, tucked amid manicured gardens. The warm glow from the chandeliers inside spilled onto the lush red carpet as they entered, hand in hand. As soon as they were seated at their candlelit table, Mary ordered two glasses of the finest champagne to start. Each sip was a pleasant and delicate surprise for Rachel, who had hardly any experience with such indulgence. The excitement in her eyes was evident, making Mary's choice even more rewarding. She took pride in providing this experience for her dear friend. For the first course, they decided to share the exquisite truffle foie gras terrine, accompanied by tender, crunchy slices of toasted brioche. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, further enhancing the already divine evening. Rachel could hardly contain her delight and slyly whispered to Mary, \\"I could get used to this!\\" As they reveled in the atmosphere and their time together, they continued onto the main course. Mary, knowing her friend's love for seafood, suggested the pan-seared sea scallops with a lemon beurre blanc and a side of saffron risotto. They were cooked to perfection, filling their mouths with a sumptuous burst of flavors. Finally, for dessert, Mary took Rachel's hand and guided her eyes to the most decadent selection on the menu - the chocolate fondant with raspberry coulis and a scoop of Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream. As the melting chocolate and rich red raspberry sauce danced around their palates, they exchanged sweet smiles over the indulgence. In the end, Mary was undeniably victorious in her effort to make the evening memorable. The delight on Rachel's face was a testament to her success. And as the night continued, they found themselves lost in conversation, reminiscing about old memories and creating new ones. For in that moment, Mary knew she had given Rachel more than just a remarkable meal.

Phone Soap: Charge and Clean Your Phone You may charge your phone every day, but do you clean your phone as much? Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli. The research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges. \\"There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,\\" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. \\"He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,\\" said Barnes. \\"In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines.\\" Phone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, \\"The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully.\\" The co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up. Both co-founders have left their previous jobs and are selling Phone Soap nonstop. \\"We're shipping almost more than we can handle each day,\\" Barnes says. \\"It's been a great adventure.\\" Answer this series of questions: 1.

Please answer the following question: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought?

Santamental, released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing.

Please answer the following question: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight. James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right. Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","completion":"A nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal when they are in the same row of the periodic table. This is because as you move from left to right across the table, the atomic number (and thus the number of electrons) increases. Metals are generally found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are on the right side. So, in the same row, a nonmetal will have more electrons than a metal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees? In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

TMZ has learned. We just got hold of the probation report in the Rihanna case, which outlines what happened during his 13 days in a Malibu rehab joint for anger management counseling. According to the report, Chris' mom showed up for a family session and was urging her son to stay in the facility for extended treatment. Apparently, Chris violently disagreed with her and in a fit of anger threw a rock through her car window, shattering it. The report goes on to say without continued therapy and a strong recovery support network, Probation says his prognosis is \\"very guarded.\\" And here's an interesting detail from the report: before Chris entered rehab on October 29th, he says he had issues with Attention Deficit Disorder and also underwent a period of depression. TMZ broke the story ... Chris got booted from the Malibu facility earlier this month following the outburst ... after just two weeks of treatment. As we reported, the judge has just ordered Brown to 90 days in a facility and also ordered him to submit to drug testing. ||||| Chris Brown was ordered by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge on Wednesday to check into a live-in rehab facility for 90 days' worth of anger management, L.A. Now reports. That order came during a probation hearing that had been on the schedule before the R&B singer was arrested in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 27 and charged with misdemeanor assault. During the 90-day live-in stint, to be done in Los Angeles County at a facility approved by probation officials, Brown will also have to complete three eight-hour days of community service each week and undergo periodic drug tests. He's still on probation related to his 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna. He will be allowed to fly to Washington for legal proceedings related to his assault charge. Also, it turns out that Brown, who'd gone to rehab of his own accord after the D.C. arrest but walked out about two weeks later, was actually ordered out of that Malibu facility Nov. 10 for violent behavior after he threw a rock and shattered a window on his mother's car, according to a probation report obtained by L.A. Now. The blow-up was initiated during a family counseling session in which his mom said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the records show. Brown then walked out and tossed the rock. Nobody was hurt. Brown previously completed an anger-management course as part of his assault sentence, but he appears to need a little bit more work in that area.

Answer the following question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less aluminum consumed in the town happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if less aluminum is consumed in the town, it may lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. To determine if this hypothesis has a direct or indirect effect on the described process of respiration and gas exchange in the human body, we must first understand the potential relationship between aluminum consumption and oxygen delivery. Aluminum, as a metal, is not typically ingested or consumed by humans in significant amounts. However, small amounts of aluminum can be found in some foods, drinking water, and even pharmaceuticals or personal care products. There is ongoing research about the potential health effects of aluminum exposure, including potential neurotoxicity and a possible link to Alzheimer's disease. Despite these concerns, there is no current evidence to suggest that aluminum consumption has a direct impact on the process of breathing or oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. Aluminum does not take part in the gas exchange process in the lungs or play a role in transporting oxygen or carbon dioxide in the respiratory system. Therefore, the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on the process described. Additionally, since the connection between aluminum consumption and oxygen delivery is not well-established, it is also unlikely that there is an indirect effect on the process. However, further research may be needed to definitively rule out any potential indirect effects on oxygen delivery or systemic health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No matter what type of amp you have, something is supposed to change when you hit the on switch and turn up the volume. A lot of amps have power lights that activate when the amp is live. Also, listen for any noises the amp makes, since that could also help you determine the source of the problem. Car amps, for example, often have a green power LED light and a red “protect” light. The protect light often means a blown fuse, so you know to check the wiring when you see it. Go over all the wires, double-checking that they are plugged in correctly. If the amp doesn’t activate at all when you turn it on, the problem could have to do with the power supply. Sometimes you have to contend with a loose cord, which is a very easy fix to make. Wiggle the wires, testing them to see if they are in place and cause the amp to activate at all. Car amps, for instance, often have a red power wire and a black ground wire. It also has a blue remote turn-on wire that powers the amp when you turn on your vehicle. If your amp plugs into the wall, test the power cord. Also, make sure your guitar, speakers, subwoofers, and other devices are connected to the amp if you’re using them. So your amp turns on, which is a plus, but it doesn’t sound right. Sound distortion can be caused by a few different issues depending on what kind of amp you have. It is often from loose wires, but it could also be your overall setup. Sometimes replacing the wires, fixing the amp’s components, or changing your setup suddenly makes everything better.

A:","completion":"After conducting thorough research, the Major League Baseball (MLB) player that Christian Soucy is considered the NHL's version of is Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham. Here is a detailed analysis of both players and the reasons behind this comparison. Christian Soucy is a former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. Soucy had a brief professional career with stints in the AHL and ECHL before retiring in the mid-90s. However, he never made it to the ice for a regular-season NHL game, making him somewhat of a \\"phantom\\" player in NHL history. Similarly, Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham was a Major League Baseball player who appeared in only one game for the New York Giants on June 29, 1905. Graham was an outfielder, and in the only game, he played in the majors, he didn't get an opportunity to bat. He was a defensive substitution in the top of the ninth inning and did not get an at-bat before the game ended. Like Soucy, Graham's career in the MLB was brief and limited to just one appearance. The comparison between Christian Soucy and Moonlight Graham highlights their shared experience of having a negligible impact while playing at the top level of their respective sports. Both athletes had long journeys in trying to establish themselves as professional athletes, but their careers ultimately peaked with a sole appearance in the respective high-caliber leagues – for Soucy, the NHL, and Graham, the MLB. Additionally, neither player managed to achieve a statistic in their respective leagues. Soucy didn't play in any NHL games, while Graham didn't have an at-bat in his only MLB appearance. These two players serve as symbolic reminders of the challenges that many professional athletes face while pursuing their career goals. In a world where success and longevity are often attributed to the upper echelon of professional sports, Soucy and Graham remind us of the numerous athletes who experience only fleeting moments in the top leagues. With their unique stories unfolding in different eras and different sports, Christian Soucy and Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham are analogous reflections of the aspirations, obstacles, and ultimately, the brevity that thousands of professional sportsmen and women face."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

RIDICULOUS! Poor direction. The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies: \\"Oh my God!

Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, the governing body, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage.In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed a series of 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field that distorts the entire electromagnetic spectrum, nullifying all communication between Japan and the outside world and making even satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but for all intents and purposes, Japan vanishes from the world scene.Ten years later, the American Navy technology Special Forces unit \\"SWORD\\" is lead on the intel of a Japanese informant of a trap set by Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes, cut off his own leg to get rid of Vexille Serra, a soldier of SWORD. Analysis of the leg show that it is made of bio-metal. SWORD then begin to suspect that Japan has used the R.A.C.E network to conceal extensive development of banned technologies.

As grateful as I was that they didn't abandon me, I couldn't help but wonder if this was the end of my friendship with Jack and my newfound connection with Isaac. My mom listened intently, her expression softening slightly but still maintaining that stern demeanor. \\"While I appreciate your honesty, boys, it doesn't excuse the fact that my daughter disobeyed my instructions and didn't even bother to contact me to let me know what was happening. This caused unnecessary worry and frustration.\\" Turning her gaze towards me, she continued, \\"You, young lady, are grounded for two weeks.

I also expect you to make a sincere apology to your friends here, as they're now implicated in this mess as well.\\" Hanging my head in shame, I muttered my apologies to Jack and Isaac, promising to make it up to them as soon as my grounding was over.

As they left my house, I couldn't help but feel waves of both guilt and relief crashing over me. While I knew my punishment was just and deserved, it was also reassuring to see that my friends were willing to stand by my side even during the darkest moments. As the door closed behind them, I turned towards my mom, offering a final, heartfelt apology before trudging up the stairs towards my room - my prison for the next two weeks. But as I lay in bed that night, the support and encouragement from my friends fueled my resolve to grow from this experience, to learn from my mistakes, and to keep the bonds of our friendship alive. The following days were filled with a mix of mundane chores and quiet reflection, helping me understand that there was more to life than just chasing temporary freedom.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The introduction is a very important part of an essay—perhaps the most important—because it orients your reader and explains your argument. For the first draft, however, don't agonize over it. You just need to begin writing. The introduction doesn't have to be perfect in the first draft, because you can come back and edit it later. Get something down, and it will help you move confidently forward. When you are pressed for time, don't worry too much about writing a creative introduction—just try to write one that is clear and focused. If you have time left at the end, you can come back and try to improve it. A simple but effective plan is to make sure that your introduction states your essay's thesis, and gives an overview of what the subsequent paragraphs or sections will discuss. Your outline will help you do this. A simple version of this would look something like \\"In this essay, I will first describe X, before moving on to Y and Z. Then, I will explain the relationship between X,Y, and Z, demonstrating that [insert thesis statement here].\\" Take the writing of the essay bit by bit, following the outline you made. This will keep your writing on track, and keeping your plan in mind will encourage you to keep going. If you're wavering between describing Shakespeare as a \\"great\\" writer, or \\"the greatest,\\" for example, just pick one for now and move on.You'll be able to deal with such things when you do a final read-through of the essay. When time is short, you will write more productively, and keep your morale up, if you keep pushing through with more writing. Cite any works you use as a reference or for quotations. If you are quoting another work, cite it according to the style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) your instructor wants you to use. Even if you are just paraphrasing a work, you should cite it. If you don't properly cite your sources, you are plagiarizing. As a rule of thumb, if you got an idea or information from a source outside of your own head, you should cite it. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fc/Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/f/fc/Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid202072-v4-728px-Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} It is far easier to cite while you are writing than to go back and try to add in citations after you have written your paper. Keep up with them as you go. While you have to work quickly, take a short break from writing now and then, especially if you get stuck—just don't get distracted and take too long. Some prefer to take scheduled breaks, by setting a timer or watching a clock. Others prefer to take a break after reaching a convenient stopping point, such as the end of a paragraph or page. Whatever method you choose, make a note of where to pick back up when you return to writing. Take a breath, get up, have a drink or snack. By taking a short break, you're not wasting time—you're actually helping yourself write more efficiently by clearing your head and relieving stress.","completion":"The article emphasizes the significance of the introduction in an essay, offering tips for drafting it effectively, maintaining focus, citing sources, and taking breaks to improve productivity and reduce stress while writing under time constraints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the citizens become less aware of solar and the benefits it offers, the demand for solar power falls. What happens to the cost of the technology as the demand decreases increase or decrease?","completion":"As Mona lives in a city where awareness about solar power and its benefits is decreasing, the demand for solar power falls. Based on the passage's statement that as demand increases, technology improves and costs decrease, it can be inferred that as demand decreases, technology improvement slows, and costs may not experience the same rate of decrease as before or even increase. In such a scenario, the cost of solar power technology in Mona's city would likely not decrease as rapidly or effectively as in cities where solar power knowledge and demand are on the rise. Ideally, the cost of technology should decrease as production becomes more efficient, technology gets mature, and market competition increases. However, in this particular case, with the declining demand, there would be fewer incentives for solar power producers and technology developers to keep investing in research, meaning reduced innovation, less competition, and less pressure to keep lowering costs. Unfortunately, this could lead to a higher cost of solar power technology for residents in Mona's city, compared to areas where demand is increasing and awareness is strong. Public policies, local government support, and businesses adapting to solar power could counter this issue to some extent. In conclusion, as the demand for solar power decreases in Mona's city due to the decrease in awareness among its citizens, the cost of the technology is likely to not decrease as much or may even increase compared to the cost in more solar-aware cities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This implies a decrease in prices, rather than an increase. There could be various reasons supporting the drop of prices at the end of the day. One potential explanation is that sellers might want to clear their stock before closing, so they reduce the prices to attract more customers. Another reason could be that a majority of tourists leave at the end of the day, so the sellers reduce prices to entice remaining tourists or locals to make purchases. However, it is essential to note that prices may vary depending on different factors such as location, types of goods or services, and sellers' strategies. While the statement suggests that prices drop at the end of the day, it is not indicative of the price trend throughout the whole day – they might see an increase during peak hours or even right before the tour groups start leaving, for example.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone.

A review with such a tone would generally deter potential buyers from purchasing the product. 2. Functional Issue: The reviewer points out a major functional issue in the product – it not being able to recharge properly. This is an essential requirement for a rechargeable item, failing to meet which would render it rather useless. A product that does not fulfill its basic function is likely to be a poor investment. 3. Comparison with another brand: The reviewer compares the product with one from Kodak and claims that Kodak's product works fine. This immediately generates a perception that the alternative brand may be superior, decreasing the chances of buying the reviewed product, and potentially directing potential buyers to consider the Kodak variant instead. 4. Zero-star rating: The reviewer explicitly rates the product as zero stars. A low rating like this should raise alarm bells for potential buyers, as it establishes that the reviewer did not find any redeeming qualities about the product. 5. Discarded product: The fact that the reviewer threw the product away, indicates that they felt there was no possibility of repairs or returns and found it unfit for any usage. This adds to the impression that the product lacks durability and has poor quality, further decreasing the probability of buying it based on this review. In summary, upon considering the review's negative feedback, functional issue, comparison with another brand, zero-star rating, and the fact that it was discarded, it is clear that the review would significantly reduce the chances of buying the product. Before making a decision, it is critical to consider other reviews and gather more information on the product, as this particular review could be just one of the many opinions out there. However, this review in isolation raises several red flags that would discourage a potential buyer from purchasing the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Some people suffered from a fever or a cough. Don't be afraid---it's not easy to be infected with the virus. Here is some advice to help you protect yourself when it comes. Wash your hands. You need to wash your hands with soap and hot water before you eat, after you use the toilet , and after you touch animals, because your hands may carry viruses. Cover your nose and mouth, when someone sneezes or coughs, flu viruses can travel as far as one meter through the air, so you'd better stand a proper distance while talking to someone who has a cold. And always cover your nose and mouth with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough, and then clean your hands. Wear a mask . Some doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 80%, but if you don't wash your hands often, it's no use wearing a mask. And it's necessary to wear a mask in the groups of people. Do sports often. Exercise will help your body strong enough to _ the virus.

Step 2: Compare the elements in both the premise and hypothesis. - Construction equipment requirements - Modest requirements - Systems installed at the back end of the facility - Close to the ground Step 3: Analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise specifies that FGD installations have modest construction equipment requirements due to their location at the back end of the facility and close to the ground. The hypothesis makes a general claim that systems installed at the back end of the facility and close to the ground typically have modest construction equipment requirements. Step 4: Determine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. By comparing the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the premise supports the hypothesis, at least in the case of FGD installations.

Some radio stations use the term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which tend more towards 1960s-1980s rock music. - Alternative Songs (also called Alternative and formerly known as Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Modern Rock Tracks) is a music chart in the United States that has appeared in \\"Billboard\\" magazine since September 10, 1988. It lists the 40 most-played songs on modern rock radio stations, most of which are alternative rock songs. The chart was introduced as a companion to the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s. - Viacom, Inc. (known simply as Viacom) is an American media conglomerate with interests primarily in cinema and cable television. It is currently the world's sixth largest broadcasting and cable company in terms of revenue, behind Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox and CBS Corporation, respectively.

Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews. It is aimed primarily at the 1529 age group, although the average age of the UK audience in 2008 was 33. BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991. - MTV2 (formerly M2) is an American digital cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. The channel was initially broadcast over-the-air in selected markets, where the former all-request music channel known as The Box was broadcast. The channel was originally launched as a constant commercial-free music video channel, much like the original MTV channel; but once MTV started to change its focus from music to reality television in the 2000s, MTV2's focus changed as well, thus bringing music video programming away from both MTV and MTV2. Today, MTV2 broadcasts unscripted programming and syndicated television episodes from MTV and other networks. - Satellite television is according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\". - A music video is a short film integrating a song and imagery, produced for promotional or artistic purposes. Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \\"illustrated song\\", \\"filmed insert\\", \\"promotional (promo) film\\", \\"promotional clip\\", \\"promotional video\\", \\"song video\\", \\"song clip\\" or \\"film clip\\". Since the creation and increased popularity of YouTube, mainstream artists now promote new music videos by releasing trailers of short promos on the site for their upcoming song and music video. Consequentially, YouTube has been converted into a social media platform for celebrities and artists to market themselves to their fans - New Musical Express (NME) is a British music journalism magazine published since 1952. It was the first British paper to include a singles chart, in the edition of 14 November 1952. In the 1970s it became the best-selling British music newspaper. During the period 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism, then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill, Paul Morley and Tony Parsons. It started as a music newspaper, and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 1990s, changing from newsprint in 1998. - Viacom Media Networks (formerly MTV Networks) is an American mass media division of Viacom that oversees the operations of many of its television channels and Internet brands, including Nickelodeon, BET, CMT, Comedy Central, VH1 and the original MTV channel in the United States. Its sister international division is Viacom International Media Networks. - Gordon Peter Moakes (born 22 June 1976) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of rock band Young Legionnaire and former member of indie rock band Bloc Party. - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations, and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors, although in some shows celebrities may participate. It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\" - Digital cable is any type of cable television distribution using digital video compression for USE. The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (top 5) and published in \\"Music Week\\" magazine (top 75), and on the OCC website (top 100). - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Bloc Party are an English indie rock band, currently composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in \\"NME\\" magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \\"She's Hearing Voices\\". - The Irish Albums Chart is the Irish music industry standard albums popularity chart issued weekly by the Irish Recorded Music Association and compiled on its behalf by Chart-Track. Chart rankings are based on sales, which are compiled through over-the-counter retail data captured electronically each day from retailers' Point of sale systems and certain digital retailers. All major record stores and over forty independents submit data for the charts, accounting for over 80% of the market, according to Chart-Track. A new chart is compiled and released to the public by the Irish Recorded Music Association on Friday at noon. Each chart is dated with the \\"week-ending\\" date of the previous Thursday (i.e., the day before issue). - House music is a genre of electronic music created by club DJs and music producers that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. - YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Question: Why should goals be set Options: - because it makes you work - because it gives you incentive - not enough information - Because it shows progress === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"Because setting goals gives you an incentive, a clear direction, and a way to measure progress. Having goals keeps you motivated and focused on achieving them, especially when it comes to weight loss. It allows you to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your diet or exercise routine. When you reach a goal, it provides a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue working towards your ultimate weight loss goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who succeed in repairing an aircraft? The US Army is conducting a fighting retreat. A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up. There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time. The remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting heavy losses and ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed, leaving only Dane, Todd, and a wounded Purckett alive. Purckett is shot, while Todd stabbed through the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead. Before he dies, Todd admits to Dane he is Burns. Answer:","completion":"The full names of the people who succeed in repairing an aircraft are Lieutenant Steve Bentley and Corporal Juan Katigbak."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Dutch Take Over: Intent on capturing a piece of the Portuguese trade in pepper and other spices, the Java-based Dutch Ailied with the Malays in 1633 to blockade Melaka. The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout this period, the east coast states enjoyed a relatively tranquil prosperity, Terengganu notably thriving from its textile industry and trading in pepper and gold with the Thais, Cambodians, and Chinese. The British, under the private auspices of the East India Company (EIC), were beginning to poke their noses into North Borneo.

The paragraph mentions a woman who is hosting a news segment, which implies she is a news anchor or reporter. The paragraph also mentions a clip of a dog jumping, suggesting the news segment is about a lighthearted or entertaining topic. Furthermore, the presence of people indicates that there might be a crowd or an audience who is watching the dog jumping. Step 2: Establish a clear connection. Since the news segment leads into a clip of a dog jumping, and people are present in the scene, the connection should focus on the news segment's reaction to the clip and the reason behind the presence of people.

Write some highlights for the following article: Princess Stephanie of Monaco can't keep away from the circus - she spent a third night at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo yesterday evening. Wearing a smart long leather jacket, Stephanie, 49, was presented with a bunch of flowers by the a cast of clowns, who all seemed incredibly happy to see her again. The Princess is a huge supporter of the circus and appeared delighted to greet the colourful performers, who were decked out in their best costumes. Scroll down for video. What a gang: Wearing a long black coat Princess Stephanie of Monaco spent her third day at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo. Sealed with a kiss: Princess Stephanie was greeted by the ring master who gently kissed her hand. The Princess looked radiant on the evening, wearing her long dark hair down around her shoulders, while a lacy top peeked out from underneath her coat. For the second night in a row, Princess Stephanie was treated to a kiss on the hand from ringmaster Petit Gougou during the show. She attended the event with her youngest daughter Camille, who recently celebrated her 16th birthday. Controversy surrounded Camille's birth in 1998 as Stephanie neglected to name a father on her birth certificate. As such, Camille is not included in the line to the Monegasque throne, unlike her brother Louis Robert and her sister Pauline Grace. It was rumoured at the time that her father was Jean-Raymond Gottlieb who was Princess Stephanie's former body guard, but nothing has ever been confirmed. Natural beauty: Princess Stephanie looked radiant on her night out at the circus wearing a bright red lipstick. Like mother, like daughter: Princess Stephanie attended the event yesterday evening with her look-a-like daughter Camille, pictured in the red patterned jacket. Clowning around: As Stephanie posed for a photograph one of the performers tried to chat with her. Just the day before her trip with Camille, the Princess had also attended the circus for a rare night out with her brother Prince Albert of Monaco. Beaming broadly as a spiky haired Italian clown named Fumagali approached, Prince Albert was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed the evening. The festival is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974. But while Albert and Stephanie appeared to be enjoy the show, the newest additions to Monaco's royal family were nowhere to be seen. New mother Princess Charlene was absent, having chosen to remain at home with month-old twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier and Gabriella Thérèse Marie. All smiles: Prince Albert and Princess Stephanie enjoy the antics of Italian clown Fumagalli. What a gentleman! Ringmaster Petit Gougou plants a kiss on Stephanie's outstretched hand. Their absence didn't prevent Prince Albert from enjoying himself, although the event did briefly take a sombre turn at the beginning of the night. Part way through the opening ceremony, a minute's silence was held in memory of stunt rider Kevin Ferrari, a.k.a Flic Flac Moto X, 24, who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on Wednesday. Despite his death, the show continued after the minute's silence with elephants, acrobats and clowns all on the billing. Royal approval: The clown, real name Giovanni Huesca, raised smiles all round. Round of applause: Albert, who was taking a night off from daddy duties, claps at the end of the performance. Welcome: New father Albert also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively. Looking good: Despite having two tiny babies to care for, Albert looked surprisingly fresh. Royal wave: Albert waves to the Monte Carlo crowd from the comfort of the royal box. Tribute: Ahead of the performance, there was a minute's silence for a performer who died earlier this week. The prince certainly appeared to enjoy rest of the show though, gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared and threw himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse. At the time Stephanie, who is patron of the International Circus Festival, was making her second visit to the Big Top in a week, having already met clowns and elephant trainers on Tuesday. During that visit, the 49-year-old, who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000, was seen patting one of the circus' pachyderms, looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk. The royal, who also helps to oversee the Circus Festival and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography, first attended the event when she was just nine. Her father Prince Ranier was the brains behind the first festival, which now as then, specialises in traditional circus acts from clowns to acrobats. Left at home: Princess Charlene chose to remain at the Palais Princier along with the baby twins. Glamorous: The chic 36-year-old was last seen on the 7th January when the babies were presented. Daredevil: A member of Russian group Yakov Ekk performs in front of the royal box. Ouch! An Asian elephant trained by Elvis Errani shows off his dexterity during the performance. Amazing: Equilibrist acrobats from China's National Acrobatic Troupe show off their impressive skills. Awe inspiring: An Asian elephant completes its turn as do Russians Elena Petrikova and Elena Baranenko. Magnificent: Russian equine troupe Yakov Ekk wave a Monaco national flag during the finale of their act. Highlights:","completion":"Princess Stephanie of Monaco loves going to the circus!

Article: Epidemiologic studies have reported conflicting results on the relationship between daytime napping and mortality risk, and there are few data on the potential association in the British population. We investigated the associations between daytime napping and all-cause or cause-specific mortality in the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer-Norfolk study, a British population-based cohort study. Among the 16,374 men and women who answered questions on napping habits between 1998 and 2000, a total of 3,251 died during the 13-year follow-up. Daytime napping was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (for napping less than 1 hour per day on average, hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.27; for napping 1 hour or longer per day on average, hazard ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.68), independent of age, sex, social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, body mass index, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, depression, self-reported general health, use of hypnotic drugs or other medications, time spent in bed at night, and presence of preexisting health conditions. This association was more pronounced for death from respiratory diseases (for napping less than 1 hour, hazard ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 0.95, 2.05; for napping 1 hour or more, hazard ratio = 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.34, 4.86) and in individuals 65 years of age or younger. Excessive daytime napping might be a useful marker of underlying health risk, particularly of respiratory problems, especially among those 65 years of age or younger. Further research is required to clarify the nature of the observed association. Most previous studies have come from Mediterranean countries ( 10 – 13 ), in which the incidence of and rate of death from CVD tend to be low ( 6 ). Several prospective cohort studies from Israel showed that an increased mortality rate was associated with siesta among older people ( 10 , 11 ), whereas 1 study from Greece suggested that the siesta is protective against heart-related deaths, especially in working men ( 12 ). In addition, conflicting United States–based research has found an increased risk of death associated with daytime napping in both men only ( 14 ) and women only ( 15 ). In both studies, only naps of long durations were found to be significant. A Japanese study suggested that daytime napping was associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mortality, but this association was largely explained by comorbid conditions ( 16 ). Meanwhile, there is limited evidence from the British population. Although daytime napping has not been a tradition among British adults, the prevalence of napping is likely to increase with the rapidly aging population ( 17 , 18 ), and it is therefore important to understand the health associations of daytime napping among the British. In recent years, there has been growing evidence of a relationship between habitual sleep and the risk of mortality from all-causes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) ( 1 – 3 ). Most of these studies focused on nighttime sleep duration ( 4 , 5 ); the implications of daytime napping are poorly understood. A long-established practice in Mediterranean areas, daytime napping, namely siesta, is often linked with good health through a postulated “stress relief” mechanism ( 6 ). However, daytime sleepiness, often characterized by daytime napping, has been suggested as an early sign or risk indicator of a range of health problems ( 7 – 9 ). To date, the association between daytime napping and mortality risk is uncertain. Finally, we performed stratified analysis with adjustment for all the covariates according to follow-up length and preexisting health conditions and according to potential effect modifiers: age (≤65 vs. >65 years old), sex, smoking status (ever vs. never smoker), employment status, BMI (dichotomized using the median), MDD, time spent in bed at night (dichotomized using the median), and nighttime sleep duration (reported in hours at the time of the third health check). Hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated using no napping as the reference group (with adjustment for sex through inclusion of sex-specific baseline hazards). The overall associations between the 2 categories of napping and mortality were tested using the likelihood ratio test. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were implemented in Stata, version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The associations between daytime napping and all-cause or disease-specific mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models that were adjusted for covariates. The endpoints were grouped into death from all causes, CVD, cancer, respiratory diseases, and all other causes. We firstly examined the proportional hazard assumption using both a Kaplan-Meier plot and Schoenfeld's test, and no sign of violation was found for any endpoint. All covariates were chosen a priori based on the literature and their relevance to napping and health. Models were constructed with progressive adjustment of the covariates to show the associations explained by the covariates: 1) Model A was adjusted for age and sex; 2) model B was further adjusted for social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, BMI, physical activity level, smoking status, and alcohol intake; 3) model C was adjusted for the variables in model B and MDD, self-reported general health, time spent in bed at night, hypnotic drug use, antidepressant use, and COPD drug use; and 4) model D was further adjusted for the variables in all models and preexisting health conditions. Each multivariable model was built on persons for whom we had complete measurements of all covariates. Participants were flagged for death certification at the United Kingdom Office of National Statistics so that we were notified of their deaths, with vital status established for the whole cohort. The current analysis presents deaths that occurred during followed up from January 2000 and until December 2012. Deaths were coded initially according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision, and later the Tenth Revision. The underlying cause of death was categorized as due to CVD (ICD-9 codes 401–448 or ICD-10 codes I10–I79), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–208 or ICD-10 codes C00–C97), or respiratory diseases (ICD–9 codes 460–496 or ICD-10 codes J00–J99). Covariates measured closer in time to the measurement of napping were chosen and included those measured at baseline or at the time of the second health check (1998–2000). Covariates measured at baseline were social class (professionals, managerial and technical occupations, skilled workers subdivided into nonmanual and manual, partly skilled workers, or unskilled manual workers), educational level (highest qualification attained: no qualifications, educated to age 16 years, educated to age 18 years, or educated to degree level), and physical activity level (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, or active) ( 22 ). Body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was measured at the baseline health check. Other covariates were reported in questionnaires during the time of the second health check: age, marital status (single, married, widowed, separated, or divorced), employment status (working or not working), smoking status (current, former, or nonsmokers), alcohol intake (units of alcohol drunk per week), self-reported general health (excellent, good, moderate, or poor), use of hypnotic drugs (yes or no), antidepressant use (yes or no), use of drugs to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (yes or no), major depressive disorder (MDD) in the previous year (yes or no) ( 23 ), and time spent in bed at night (in hours, derived from the differences between reported rise times and bedtimes). Hypnotic drug use was defined according to the British National Formulary (section 4.1) ( 24 ) and included benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone, chloral and its derivatives, clomethiazole, and antihistamines. Preexisting health conditions included self-reported stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, as well as a proxy measure of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with persons who were in the highest BMI quartile and who reported taking antihypertension drugs being defined as likely to have underlying OSA. During 1998–2000, a total of 16,374 participants completed the following question in the health questionnaire: “Do you normally take a nap during the day?” If they answered in the affirmative, they were asked to categorize the duration of their nap (<1 hour or ≥1 hour). Napping habits were thereby summarized as: no napping, napping less than 1 hour, and napping 1 hour or more per day. Data were drawn from the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk prospective cohort study. The design and study methods of EPIC-Norfolk have been described previously ( 20 , 21 ). Briefly, 25,639 men and women aged 40–79 years were recruited using general practice age-sex registers from Norfolk, United Kingdom, and attended a baseline health check during 1993–1997. These participants were then followed up for 2 further health checks from 1996 to 2000 and from 2006 to 2011. In between these health examinations, participants were sent questionnaires for completion and return by post. The Norwich District Ethics Committee approved the study, and all participants gave signed informed consent. A total of 3,251 deaths (1,034 from CVD, 1,213 from cancer, 286 from respiratory diseases, and 718 from all other causes) were observed during the 13-year follow-up. There were 1,795 deaths in men and 1,456 in women. Table 3 shows the adjusted hazard ratios associated with napping. After adjustment for age and sex, daytime napping was associated with a 22% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality in persons who napped less than 1 hour (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 1.31) and a 54% increase for persons who napped 1 hour or longer (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.81). The hazard ratios were attenuated to 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.27) for napping less than 1 hour and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.68) for napping 1 hour or longer after further adjustment for social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, BMI, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, MDD, self-reported general health, hypnotic drug use, antidepressant and COPD drug use, and time spent in bed at night. This association was little changed after additional adjustment for preexisting health conditions, with a 14% and 32% increase in all-cause mortality risk among those who napped for less than 1 hour or 1 hour or more per day, respectively. This association was more pronounced for death from respiratory diseases (for napping <1 hour, HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.95, 2.05; for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.34, 4.86). No statistically significant associations were observed for death from other causes after full adjustments. Table 4 shows results from stratified analysis for all-cause mortality. The association was stronger in those who were younger (for napping <1 hour, HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.79; for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.28; P for interaction = 0.04 for persons 42–65 years of age compared with those 65–82 years of age) and in those who had a lower BMI (for napping <1 hour, HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.56; for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.45; P for interaction = 0.02 for those with a BMI of 15.2–25.7 compared with those with a BMI of higher than 25.7). In addition, there was a suggestion that this association was stronger in persons who reported experiencing MDD in the past 12 months (for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.12, 7.50; P for interaction = 0.13) and in those who were working (for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.16, 5.20; P for interaction = 0.33). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, cigarette smoking history, time spent in bed at night, nighttime sleep duration, or preexisting health conditions (among those who reported no preexisting CVD, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, or underlying sleep apnea at baseline and who napped for ≥1 hour, HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.93). Furthermore, there was no evidence that the association attenuated with increasing length of follow-up (in these data, the association was stronger after 6.5 years of follow-up; P for interaction = 0.07). During 1998–2000, napping during the day was reported by 2,653 of 7,161 men (37.0%) and 2,228 of 9,213 women (24.2%). Tables 1 and 2 show participants' baseline characteristics by napping habits. Among the persons who took naps, only 10% napped for more than 1 hour per day. Those who took naps were more likely to be men and were on average 6 years older than those who did not nap. Persons who took naps were more likely to be smokers, not working, and less active and to have a lower educational level, higher BMI, and poor self-reported general health. The above associations were all stronger for those who napped for longer time periods. DISCUSSION In the present large sample of middle- to older-aged British adults, daytime napping of 1 hour per day or more was associated with a 32% increase in the risk all-cause mortality during the 13-year follow-up. This association was independent of age, sex, social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, BMI, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, MDD, self-reported general health, time spent in bed at night, hypnotic drug use, antidepressant use, COPD drug use, and preexisting health conditions and was similar among men and women. The associations were more pronounced for deaths from respiratory illness and for participants who were 65 years of age or younger. Furthermore, the association between napping and all-cause mortality remained among those without preexisting health conditions and did not attenuate with increasing length of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first study to present in detail the association between daytime napping and cause-specific mortality in a British population. Strengths of our study include the long follow-up and range of measures for which we were able to adjust. Our study has several limitations. First, 16,374 of the 25,639 participants at baseline completed the subsequent mailed questionnaire that contained the napping question. Compared with the rest of the participants, these 16,374 people were more likely to be women and to have a higher social class and educational level. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to populations with lower socioeconomic status. Second, the information on napping was obtained from self-report. Previous studies (25, 26) have shown a tendency for older people to underreport napping behaviors, and this may lead to underestimation of the association. It was suggested that naps of less than 30 minutes (usually known as power naps) can be largely beneficial, especially among shift workers (27–29), whereas naps longer than 30 minutes can cause sleep inertia and are usually not recommended (30). Napping duration was categorized into less than 1 hour and 1 hour or more in our questionnaire, and we were therefore unable to differentiate the effects of power naps from those of excessive napping. Although this might have diluted the overall association, we conclude from the current study that there is an increased health risk associated with excessive daytime napping. Voluntary naps and naps as a result of underlying pathology have different implications for health, and identification of the reasons for the naps is crucial. Although a range of preexisting health conditions and medication use was considered in this study, we cannot rule out that our results may be partly explained by the effects of other undiagnosed health problems or medications not included in this study that might cause daytime fatigue or sleepiness. Daytime napping might be a consequence of nighttime sleep disturbance, which has been associated with an increased risk of death (31). Although the detailed purpose of napping was not recorded in the present study, the association between daytime napping and mortality risk did not change by nighttime sleep durations and was independent of time spent in bed at night, which has been suggested to be a good indicator of nighttime sleep patterns in the EPIC-Norfolk population (32). In addition, a surrogate measure of OSA was included in regression models to help address the problem. This measure combines BMI and hypertension, 2 strong correlates of OSA (33–35). The surrogate measure may partly reflect the probability of having OSA; therefore, further studies with more precise measures of OSA and nighttime sleep quality are required to confirm whether the association stands independent of other sleep parameters. Our findings are consistent with most previous studies that have reported an association between self-reported daytime napping and increased all-cause mortality (10, 11, 14–16, 36, 37). These studies covered populations from the Mediterranean, Japan, and the United States and included primarily older populations. The largest published report to date came from the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study, in which a total of 9,643 deaths were recorded and daytime napping was found to be associated with increased mortality from specific causes, particularly CVD (16). Indeed, most previous studies have related daytime napping to increased CVD mortality risk (10, 15, 16, 37). In our study, the association between napping and CVD mortality risk was largely explained by MDD in the previous year. MDD is commonly associated with sleep disturbance, which might lead to excessive daytime napping. Previous evidence based upon our cohort (23) has shown major depression to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality, though understanding of this association remains elusive. It is possible that the association between napping and CVD mortality is mostly explained by depression or MDD reported within a certain time frame. Future studies would need to carefully examine the role of depression in the napping-mortality association. At the same time, several earlier studies (6, 12) from Mediterranean populations have suggested different findings. The Greek EPIC cohort study, which is methodologically comparable to our study, found napping to be protective against coronary mortality (12). Notably, the Greek cohort included people who were 20–86 years of age at baseline, whereas our participants were exclusively middle- to older-aged adults. Moreover, the association was particularly strong among working men in their study, which might be explained by the possible stress-releasing effect of afternoon naps (12). This effect could have been masked in our aging population, who are mostly retired and might take naps for other purposes, such as compensating for declining physical functions. Interestingly, in our study, the positive association between napping and mortality was seen to be stronger among persons 65 years of age or younger than among those older than 65 years of age (65 years is the age by which most people have retired from work in the United Kingdom). It is often believed that napping is protective for younger populations and problematic for older ones (12, 19, 37). Notably, the average age of our participants at baseline was 62 years, so the younger persons in the present study were not comparable to those mentioned in earlier studies (12, 38). Although it is unknown why the association was stronger among those 65 years of age or younger, our finding raises the possibility that napping might be more indicative of mortality risk in this population, and this needs to be confirmed by further studies. Unlike in previous studies (14, 36), no evident sex difference was observed in this study. In the present study, we found large effect sizes for the association between napping and death from respiratory disease even though there were much fewer respiratory deaths than CVD and cancer deaths. The association was independent of smoking status, preexisting respiratory diseases, and COPD drug use. This is surprising given the lack of evidence of the associations between napping and respiratory health. Although none of the previous studies highlighted the association between napping and respiratory mortality, most of them did suggest the association with non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (10, 15, 16), and these categories were largely made up of respiratory mortality in our study. The reason why daytime napping may increase respiratory mortality is not known, but it is worth noting the interrelationship between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (39). Although we failed to find an association between napping and CVD mortality, the napping-respiratory association might not be separate from the cardiovascular consequences of sleep problems (e.g., OSA). It seems reasonable to suggest that persons with respiratory problems (especially hypoxic conditions) were more likely to nap and were also more likely to die of respiratory disease because of their underlying problems. The incidence of OSA was not recorded directly in this study, and a proxy measure was used to account for the effects. Given the close link between OSA and mortality (40, 41), daytime napping might well be a good surrogate measure of OSA, which is potentially important for early detection of OSA in the general population. Although in this study the association between napping and all-cause mortality remained after excluding participants with known preexisting health conditions at baseline, it remains possible that daytime napping is simply a marker of undiagnosed health problems and of reverse causation, with those individuals who have undiagnosed ill health napping more. In this case, we would expect attenuation in the association whereby it is stronger in the immediate period of follow-up and lessens thereafter. However, the association seemed to be even stronger among those with a follow-up length of 6.5 years or more. Interestingly, the association was stronger among persons with a lower BMI. Although the exact reason for this observation is unclear, it is worth noting the “obesity paradox,” which might have been brought about by existing physiological or pathological changes (42, 43). It is possible that persons with lower BMI could have been suffering from underlying illnesses that led to weight loss and that this added to the health risk conveyed by daytime napping. In the United Kingdom, daytime napping is not part of the cultural norm, and in the absence of obvious disruptions in nighttime sleep patterns, it remains plausible that napping might be an early sign of system disregulation and a marker of future health problems. Alternatively, there may be a biological mechanism through which napping is associated with mortality, for example, through inflammatory pathways, especially increased chronic low-grade inflammation. Increased levels of inflammation have been suggested for persons with reduced nighttime sleep durations (44), but we are unaware of any evidence to show an association between daytime napping and inflammation. Our findings need confirmation from further population studies that include examination of the relationship between napping and physiological biomarkers. This further work could help evaluate whether there is a causal link between napping and mortality risk or whether napping is a marker of system disregulation or of undiagnosed respiratory problems that lead to an increased risk of future ill health. In summary, independent associations were found between daytime napping and an increased risk of mortality from all causes and respiratory diseases in a large population-based middle- to older-aged British cohort. The association remained after exclusion of persons who died within the first 6.5 years of follow-up and was more pronounced for people 65 years of age or younger. The exact mechanisms of these associations remain unknown. Further studies are needed before any recommendations can be made. Excessive daytime napping might be a useful marker of underlying health risks, particularly respiratory problems, especially among those 65 years of age or younger. ||||| Why taking an afternoon nap 'raises risk of an EARLY DEATH by a third' Adults who nap are more likely develop deadly respiratory issues Scientists say napping can trigger inflammation in the body The findings from say dozing could be a symptom of lung disease Napping, once thought of as a harmless way to recharge one's batteries throughout the day, could now have deadly effects It seems a pretty harmless occupation, but taking an afternoon nap can knock years off your life, say researchers. British adults who sleep for an hour or more in the day increased the chances of premature death by almost a third, scientists found. The biggest risks appear to be associated with lung diseases, such as bronchitis, emphysema and pneumonia. Adults who nap every day are up to two-and-a-half times more likely to die from respiratory illnesses than those who don’t. Researchers said that this could be because napping triggers inflammation in the body. However, the findings, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, also suggested that dozing during the day could be a signal that the person already has lung disease. Experts at Cambridge tracked more than 16,000 British men and women over 13 years. They studied adults who, in the late nineties, signed up to a major research project investigating the effects of diet and lifestyle on cancer. As part of the project, volunteers gave details of their sleeping habits – including whether they took a nap in the day. Researchers then followed them up for 13 years and recorded the number of deaths – just over 3,000 – and what caused them. When they matched mortality rates with sleeping habits, they found the risk of death increased slightly by about 14 per cent in people who dozed less than an hour in the day. But if their naps lasted more than an hour, the risks increased by 32 per cent. When they looked at causes of death, they found the chances of dying from a respiratory illness more than doubled if naps lasted over an hour. The chance of death of those who napped among 16,000 people increased by around 32 per cent But the report added: ‘It remains plausible that napping might be an early sign of system disregulation and a marker of future health problems.’ Professor Jim Horne, from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, said short naps can still be a major help. He said: ‘The findings actually show that the great majority – about 85 per cent – of those people who napped less than one hour were at no greater risk.’ He said it is possible that people in the study with serious and incurable lung illnesses might even have benefited from snoozing in the day and that napping ‘may not have hastened death but delayed it’. Last year, a study in China – where taking a post-lunch snooze is very popular – found napping for more than 30 minutes at a time raised the chances of developing type two diabetes. But scientists could not be sure that it wasn’t hidden diabetes that made people sleep, rather than napping triggering the disease. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Taking daytime naps of 1 hour or more has been found to increase the risk of premature death by almost a third, according to a study of more than 16,000 participants by Cambridge University.

Hello little friends! Today, we will learn about a brave man named Zrinski, who lived a long, long time ago. His full name was Nikola Zrinski, and he was a very important person in a place called Croatia. People looked up to him because he was smart, brave, and a strong leader. One day, Zrinski had to make some difficult decisions. There were two things that he had to do: destroy a big bridge and try to conquer a town called Nagykanizsa. But which one did he do first? Let's find out together! First, let's talk about the bridge. There was a giant, strong bridge that connected two land areas, and many people used it to travel back and forth. But, the enemies were using the bridge too! So, Zrinski thought that if he could destroy the bridge, it would help keep his people safe from the bad guys. Next, there was a town named Nagykanizsa. It was a very important town, and Zrinski wanted to conquer it. \\"Conquer\\" means to take control of a place so that it belongs to you. Zrinski wanted to do this because he believed it would help protect and make his people even stronger. Now that we know about the two choices, let's see which one happened first. Zrinski was very smart and knew that sometimes it's better to do one task before another. So, he decided to destroy the big bridge first! He thought that it would make it harder for the enemies to come and attack while he tried to conquer Nagykanizsa. Once the bridge was destroyed, Zrinski and his brave friends moved forward to try and conquer Nagykanizsa. They fought very hard, but sometimes things don't always go as planned, so they couldn't fully control the town. So, little friends, the answer to our question is that Zrinski destroyed the bridge first, before attempting to conquer Nagykanizsa. We can learn from Zrinski's story that sometimes we need to make smart choices and focus on one task before moving on to the next.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Today, we are going to learn something really cool. Did you know that you can use something called meat tenderizer to clean stains on your clothes or other fabrics? Yes, you heard it right! But, don't worry, I'll explain everything step by step. Meat tenderizer is a magic powder used to make meat softer. Guess what? It can also help us remove those naughty stains from clothes. But always remember, you have to be careful when using it on sensitive fabrics like silk and wool. Let's learn how to use meat tenderizer to clean those stains: 1. First, make sure the meat tenderizer you are using is unseasoned. That means it doesn't have any added spices, flavors, or salt. We need just the plain white powder to work its magic. 2. Next, make a special cleaning paste. To do this, simply mix a little bit of meat tenderizer powder with some water. Stir the two together until they turn into a paste that’s not too runny. It should be thick enough to spread on the fabric. 3. Now let's treat the stain. Gently rub the paste into the fabric. Be very gentle, especially if it's the delicate fabric like silk or wool. 4. Once you've covered the whole stain with the paste, let it sit for a while. This will give some time for the meat tenderizer to work its magic and break down the stain. 5. After waiting for a bit, it's time to rinse out the paste. Gently wash the paste off the fabric using water. Make sure you remove all the paste before moving on to the next step. 6. Finally, you can wash the fabric as you normally would. This can be in the washing machine or by hand, depending on the type of fabric. And voilà! You should now have a clean fabric without any stains! So, little friends, that's how you can use meat tenderizer to clean stains on fabrics. Remember always to be gentle with delicate fabrics, and ask an adult for help if you are unsure about something.

Answer this question: where does black lightning tv show take place??","completion":"The Black Lightning TV show predominantly takes place in the fictional city of Freeland, located in the United States. Created by Tony Isabella and Trevor Von Eeden, the show is based on the DC Comics character, Black Lightning, and premiered on The CW network in January 2018. Developed by Salim Akil, the series follows the life of the high school principal, Jefferson Pierce, who dons the moniker Black Lightning to save his community from various threats and criminal elements. Freeland serves as the central setting for the action, drama, and everyday life in the Black Lightning TV show. The city is portrayed as a predominantly African-American community grappling with issues such as gang violence, political corruption, and organized crime. Notably, the crime rate in Freeland had significantly escalated due to the influence of the criminal organization called The 100, led by the antagonist Tobias Whale. The city's educational institution, Garfield High School, also plays a major role in the series as an important location. Jefferson Pierce is the principal of this school, and it is his main motive to protect the students from falling into the trap of crime while making a positive impact on their lives. Jefferson had retired from his superhero career, but with the rising crime in his city and school, he returns to his role as Black Lightning, primarily to safeguard his family and community. Additionally, the show also includes some scenes set in other locations such as the secret lab of Peter Gambi, Jefferson's long-time ally, and confidant. The lab serves as a base for the Black Lightning character, where he retools his suit, plans undercover missions, strategizes the takedown of criminals, and receives information about the criminal activities happening in Freeland. In conclusion, the Black Lightning TV show primarily takes place in the fictional city of Freeland, with key locations like Garfield High School and Peter Gambi's secret lab playing crucial roles in the narrative. This setting allows the viewers to explore not only the superhero aspect of the series but also the social issues that pervade the city and its residents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 1: Why did the feather and hammer drop at the same rate when dropped on the moon? Question 2: Why do a hammer and a feather dropped from a certain height fall to the ground at the same time (neglecting air resistance)? Select from: + no + yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answer to these two questions would be the same! Let me explain. In both questions, the reason why the feather and the hammer drop at the same rate is because of something called gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls things towards each other. On the Moon and on Earth without air resistance, both the feather and the hammer are being pulled down by gravity. So, imagine if you have a big scoop of ice cream (like Earth) and a tiny sprinkle (like the Moon). The ice cream has more gravity that pulls the feather and the hammer faster, but because of the air around us on Earth, the feather falls slower. On the Moon, there's no air, so there's nothing to slow the feather down. That's why on the Moon, both the feather and the hammer fall at the same rate. The same thing would happen on Earth if there was no air to slow the feather down. The feather and the hammer would fall at the same rate because they would only have gravity pulling them down, and there would be nothing else to slow them down. So, in both cases, the answer is the same because gravity is the main reason the feather and the hammer drop at the same rate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 1: Are there any Forex brokers providing OMR/AED currency pairs to trade? Question 2: How do I trade CNY/INR currency pair? pick from the following. 1). no 2). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answering these questions in detail: **Question 1: Are there any Forex brokers providing OMR/AED currency pairs to trade?** To the best of my knowledge, trading the OMR/AED (Omani Rial/United Arab Emirates Dirham) currency pair is not widely available through most Forex brokers. This is mainly due to the fact that it is considered an exotic currency pair. Exotic pairs typically involve minor or less known currencies and may have less liquidity and higher spreads in the market, which can be less attractive to traders. However, it is not impossible to find a Forex broker that allows trading the OMR/AED pair. Some niche brokers might support trading for this pair due to specific client requests or regional focus. In this case, it would be important to perform a thorough investigation and review the credibility, reputation, and regulatory compliance of any broker you consider using before opening an account. **Question 2: How do I trade CNY/INR currency pair?** To trade the CNY/INR (Chinese Yuan Renminbi/Indian Rupee) currency pair, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Find a broker supporting the CNY/INR pair: As CNY/INR might also be considered an exotic pair, not all Forex brokers may offer it for trading. You might need to perform some research to find a broker that allows trading this currency pair. Always ensure to check the broker's credibility, reputation, fees, and regulatory compliance before opening an account. 2. Open a trading account: Once you have found a suitable broker, you will need to open a trading account with them. This usually involves providing your personal information and completing identity verification, as required by the broker. 3. Deposit funds: Fund your trading account with the required currency (typically, but not limited to, USD, EUR, or GBP). Most brokers offer various deposit methods such as bank transfer, payment via credit/debit card, or through e-wallets like Neteller, Skrill, or PayPal. Make sure you are aware of any transaction fees involved in depositing funds. 4. Choose your trading platform: Many brokers offer a choice of trading platforms, such as MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, or their proprietary trading software. Choose the platform best suited to your needs, making sure it supports trading the CNY/INR pair. 5. Analyze the CNY/INR pair: Before entering any trade, it is crucial to analyze the currency pair using technical and fundamental analysis techniques. Technical analysis primarily takes the form of charting patterns and price movements, while fundamental analysis focuses on the economic and geopolitical factors that could affect currency values. 6. Place your trade: Once you have analyzed the CNY/INR pair and have determined your trading strategy, go ahead and place your trade using the appropriate order type (market, limit, or stop order) and specifying your desired position size, stop-loss, and take-profit levels. 7. Manage your trade and monitor the results: Follow the progress of your trade, and be prepared to exit the position if your analysis or risk management parameters dictate so. Track your profits or losses and learn from your trading experiences to improve your future decisions. In conclusion, the answers to your two initial questions are different. While the OMR/AED currency pair trading might not be widely available, and you would have to search for a niche broker that supports it, the process of trading the CNY/INR pair is more straightforward, although it still requires you to find an appropriate broker offering this pair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are the following two questions the same? How do you deal with failure in research? How do I deal with failure in programming?","completion":"Although both questions are about dealing with failure, they are not the same. Let's break down the differences step-by-step to explain why: Step 1: Identify the topics The first question is about failure in research, while the second question is about failure in programming. These are two distinct topics, as research is often about generating new knowledge or finding answers through scientific inquiry, while programming involves writing, testing, and debugging code. Step 2: Analyze the context The context of dealing with failure in each domain is different. In research, failure can come from various sources, such as lack of funding, inconclusive results, experimental errors, or not being able to prove a hypothesis. In programming, failure can result from logical errors, syntax errors, run-time errors, or challenges in understanding a complex problem. Step 3: Notice the subjects The first question asks, \\"How do you deal with failure in research?\\" which is directed at the person being asked (you). The second question asks, \\"How do I deal with failure in programming?\\" which is directed at the person asking the question (the user). This distinction shifts the focus from the perspective of the person responding to the perspective of the person seeking advice. Step 4: Recognize the scope The scope of potential solutions and methods for dealing with failure may vary between research and programming. For example, strategies to overcome failure in research might involve refining hypotheses, adjusting methodologies, seeking collaboration, or finding alternative funding sources. In contrast, strategies for dealing with failure in programming might emphasize better code organization, debugging techniques, code documentation, or seeking external help from programming communities. In summary, while both questions address the broader theme of dealing with failure, the topics, context, subjects, and scopes are different, making these two questions distinct from one another."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Duncan Lee Hunter (born May 31, 1948) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993. In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi. On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D.

They wanted to share the experience with their children: Stephanie, their teenage daughter, and Mikey, their curious young son. After careful planning, they set their hearts on visiting the magnificent Grand Canyon. The family had heard about the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they couldn't wait to explore it, take photos, and create some unforgettable memories. Upon their arrival, they were indeed captivated by the breathtaking landscape that surrounded them. They spent their days hiking, sightseeing, and reveling in the grandeur of nature. During one of their hikes, they discovered a small Kiva cavern. This piqued the interest of Mikey, who loved adventure and exploration. Inside the Kiva cavern, Mikey stumbled upon a peculiar sight: black rocks with mysterious symbols etched on them. He was fascinated by these rocks and decided to take them back home as a souvenir. His parents allowed it, thinking it would be a valuable keepsake from their once-in-a-lifetime journey. Little did the Taylors know that bringing these rocks home would change their lives forever. Upon returning from their vacation, they started to notice strange occurrences around their house. It started off subtly: flickering lights, doors opening and closing by themselves, and unexplained chills in certain rooms. The family dismissed these events as mere coincidences, attributing them to their old house's quirks. However, the incidents grew increasingly intense, leaving them feeling uneasy and frightened. One evening, as the family gathered in the living room, Bronny went upstairs to check on Mikey. She was not prepared for what she found. As she opened the door to Mikey's room, she saw a wall engulfed in flames. This was unlike any fire she had ever seen – the flames seemed to have a life of their own, dancing around the very rocks Mikey had brought back from the Kiva cavern. Terrified, Bronny screamed, and the rest of the family rushed upstairs to see what had happened. They were able to extinguish the fire, but to their astonishment, the fire-damaged part of the wall had revealed something utterly unexpected: a portal. This mysterious portal seemed to beckon the family, inviting them to explore its unknown depths. Mikey, being the adventurous boy he was, wanted to go through it to uncover its secrets. But Peter and Bronny, knowing how dangerous it could be, did their best to keep their children safe and away from the potential peril that lay beyond. Now faced with the unimaginable, the Taylors had a decision to make: uncover the truth behind these black rocks and the symbols they carried, or continue living their lives in fear and uncertainty. Through their research, they discovered that the rocks were part of an ancient, mystical tribe whose stories and history were deeply intertwined with the very land in which the Grand Canyon lay. Faced with an unraveled mystery, a newfound responsibility, and a daring adventure waiting beyond a hidden portal, the Taylors' lives were about to embark on a journey unlike anything they had ever experienced before. As they braced themselves to confront the unknown, they realized that their Grand Canyon vacation had turned out to be so much more than a picturesque retreat – it had opened the door to an unbelievable world filled with magic, lore, and unsolved mysteries longing to be uncovered."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: \\"Russia,\\" he said, \\"has been presented as well-nigh the biggest threat to Nato, or to Europe, America and other countries. \\"I am sometimes confused,\\" he went on. \\"Is this 2016 or 1962?\\" Just a few days earlier in Washington, the director of the US National Intelligence Agency, James Clapper, was giving evidence on \\"worldwide threats\\" to the influential Senate Armed Services Committee. \\"I think the Russians fundamentally are paranoid about Nato,\\" he said. \\"We could be into another Cold War-like spiral here.\\" So from both the Russians and the Americans come claims of a renewed cold war. Tensions between Russia and the West are certainly bad. The Russian annexation of Crimea initiated the chill which turned frosty over Ukraine and is now getting steadily worse due to very different perceptions as to what should be done about the human catastrophe in Syria. But in truth things were not terribly good even before the Crimea crisis. Russia opposed Nato expansion and US plans for missile defence. It argued for an entirely new European security order that went beyond institutions like Nato that were simply products of the Cold War. Of course for a time in the wake of the collapse of communism there was effectively no Russian foreign policy and not much of a military to back it up. I remember vividly visiting the Black Sea fleet's base in Sevastopol in 1991. In a showy display of sea power, Soviet warships bristling with weapons were tied up alongside the dock. But venture into the base - amazingly nobody could be bothered to stop me wandering around - and you found drums leaking chemicals, rubbish and chaos everywhere, and, as if to symbolise the Soviet collapse, a ship the size of a minesweeper simply sunk at its moorings. Now Russia is back. It is determined to defend its interests in both the near-abroad - Ukraine - and farther afield in Syria. Russia is rearming. Its Syrian intervention has become a showcase and proving ground for some of its most modern weapons systems. And its rhetoric has stepped up several notches too with, particularly alarming to the West, rather loose talk about the potential use of nuclear weapons. So it all looks a little like a new cold war, but is it really one? Nobody should underestimate the depth of the differences between Russia and the West nor the potential danger to which they may lead. But hindsight is a funny thing. Commentators and politicians alike prefer the familiar. If something can be referenced to a similar situation in the past it appears easier to understand and the policy implications seemingly suggest themselves. In hindsight, we have a rather benign and unrealistic view of what the real Cold War was about. Its edge has simply gone. Think back to Winston Churchill's famous speech at Fulton, Missouri in March 1946. In it he coined a phrase that characterised the deep division of Europe. \\"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain,\\" he said, \\"has descended across the continent.\\" That \\"iron curtain\\" and the Soviet Union have both gone. This new \\"cold war\\" is not a struggle of two great ideological blocs vying with each other for global dominance. It is largely a weakened Russia seeking to stand its ground and defend its interests, as it sees them, in a hostile world. Where is the threat of world war leading to nuclear annihilation? Russia, it is said, potentially threatens the Baltic Republics. Nato has got itself in a spin over a supposedly new kind of warfare seemingly practised by the Russians - so-called hybrid war - blurring the boundaries between peace and conflict. But there are no huge Russian tank armies waiting to roll westwards towards France. There are no Warsaw Pact armies to act as Moscow's allies. And there is probably nothing in the threat that does exist that some prudent reinforcement by Nato (currently under way) cannot forestall. We forget too that the Soviet Union was ultimately beaten economically. It was a hollow force. It could not sustain the panoply of a global superpower. Well today's Russia does not even start in the superpower stakes. It is a regional player at best with an economy that is too dependent upon tumbling oil prices. Russia is in many ways a crisis waiting to happen. Indices of public health, mortality and so on are depressingly poor. It is true that Russia - through its satellite channels, its funding of curious political forces in the West and so on - seeks to create a counter-culture to the prevailing Western view. In this it has had modest success. But this is a pale shadow of the propaganda activities of Soviet days, nor are there the legions of the wrong but well-meaning supporters who saw in Soviet communism the salvation of mankind. That is not to discount current tensions. Certainly Mr Putin could over-reach. It is not impossible to imagine Nato and Russia in some peripheral sense confronting each other, say if Turkey went toe-to-toe with Moscow in Syria. But for now at least this falls short of the potential Armageddon that was, for a significant part of the Cold War, seen as an all-pervading threat. If anything this is just a throwback, a reprise of the Cold War in a minor vein. The cast is different. Many have changed sides. The context is different. The geographical scope of the rivalry is much reduced and the relative power of the players has also changed. It is simply not the Cold War of old, though, one must admit, in some ways it still seems strangely familiar.","completion":"Some people are saying that there is a new cold war happening between Russia and other countries like America and Europe. This is because of tensions between them over issues like Russia taking Crimea, disagreements over Ukraine, and having different ideas about what to do in Syria. While this situation is not good, this new \\"cold war\\" is not really like the old one. The old one was a competition between two powerful groups that wanted to control the world. Russia today is weaker and is just trying to protect its own interests. While we should not ignore the disagreements that are happening, it is not the same as the old cold war, which was a very scary time with the threat of a big war and lots of weapons. The situation today is different, with different people involved and less power at stake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bird collects bits of sticks and grass. 3. The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches. 4. Leaves, mud, and spider webs are added to the sticks. 5. The mud, leaves, and webs glue the sticks together. 6. The solid nest supports the eggs. The perturbation mentioned is that the bird finds more leaves. As per the process described in step 4, leaves are used along with mud and spider webs to make the nest stronger. If the bird finds more leaves, it will incorporate them into the nest along with mud and spider webs. The additional leaves will result in a stronger binding, which will make the nest stick together more firmly. As for the second effect mentioned, it refers to the nest staying in place more. Since more leaves will result in a stronger binding of the sticks in the nest, the nest will be more secure and will stay in place better.

According to the evaluation of the results from the SAFF 2005 survey, it seems that there is still much work to be done in addressing certain issues within the workplace. A significant portion of employees, 46%, feel that senior management will make efforts to respond to the concerns that have been raised in the survey. This demonstrates that there is room for improvement in terms of how management tackles problems or issues that have been brought to their attention through feedback from employees. Moreover, only 68% of employees consider themselves able to clearly explain the organization's direction to others. This suggests that there might be a lack of clarity regarding the organization's goals, objectives, and overarching mission among its employees. In turn, this can lead to confusion and misalignment within the workplace, hindering overall efficiency, productivity, and employee satisfaction. In order to address these concerns, several steps can be taken by the organization as a whole, and by senior management in particular: 1. Open communication channels: Encourage open and transparent communication between employees and management, ensuring that relevant information is shared regularly and in an accessible manner. This can help improve employees' understanding of the organization's direction. 2. Establish clear goals and objectives: Clearly articulate the organization's vision, mission, and objectives, ensuring that all employees are aware of them. This can provide a sense of purpose and unity within the organization, as well as a common understanding of the overarching goals. 3. Regular feedback: Conduct regular surveys and feedback sessions to gauge employees' perceptions of the organization's direction, management responsiveness, and any other areas of concern. This can help identify areas of improvement and facilitate necessary changes. 4. Management training: Invest in training and development opportunities for senior management to ensure they are equipped to address employee concerns and foster a positive workplace culture. Effective management practices can significantly impact employee satisfaction and alignment with organizational goals. 5. Employee development: Encourage employees to participate in training programs and development opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge, including understanding and communicating the organization's direction.

Their second studio album, American Tragedy, was released April 5, 2011. All of the band members use pseudonyms and wear their own unique mask, most of which are based on the common hockey goaltender design. The band originated on June 3, 2005, as The Kids from a song titled \\"Hollywood\\" (Later released as \\"The Kids\\") that Jorel Decker (J-Dog), Aron Erlichman (Deuce), and Jeff Phillips (Shady Jeff) posted on the band's MySpace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends George \\"Johnny 3 Tears\\" Ragan, Jordon \\"Charlie Scene\\" Terrell, Dylan \\"Funny Man\\" Alvarez, and Matthew \\"Da Kurlzz\\" Busek. In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band \\"Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band.\\" Phillips later left the group because of conflict with Erlichman. The band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn't try to censor the album. They first signed a record contract with MySpace Records in 2005 but they left the label after the label tried to censor their first album. They then signed a contract with A&M/Octone Records and their first album, Swan Songs was released on September 2, 2008, and reached No.22 on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 21,000 copies; which was later on released in the United Kingdom on May 18, 2009, with two bonus tracks. In April 2009, the band toured with American electronic musician Skrillex as \\"Sonny and the Blood Monkeys\\". On June 23, 2009, Hollywood Undead released Swan Songs B-Sides EP through iTunes. The band released a CD/DVD set entitled Desperate Measures on November 10, 2009. The set includes a CD of previously unreleased six new songs, three of which are cover songs, as well a previously unreleased remix of \\"Everywhere I Go\\", and six live recordings of songs from Swan Songs, and a DVD of a full live performance by the band. In December 2009, the band won Best Crunk/Rock Rap Artist at the Rock on Request Awards. In its first week of release, Desperate Measures reached No. 29 on the Billboard 200.

In the first sentence, we have the following information: 1. There is a man involved. 2. The man is walking past a woman. 3. The location is a sidewalk. 4. The man looks back at the woman. Now, let's analyze the second sentence, \\"A woman dancing at the bar\\": 1. There is a woman involved. 2. The woman is dancing. 3. The location is a bar. Although the presence of a woman is common in both sentences, there are clear differences that make the second sentence an unrelated situation: 1. In the first sentence, the woman is not mentioned to be dancing or engaging in any specific activity. The focus is on the man walking past her and looking back. 2. The locations are different. The first sentence takes place on a sidewalk, while the second sentence takes place at a bar. There is no indication that the woman on the sidewalk eventually went to a bar or that the woman at the bar is the same as the one in the sidewalk encounter. 3. In the second sentence, there is no mention of the man from the first sentence. The focus is solely on the woman and her dancing. Given these differences, the second sentence is not a true sentence in the context of the first sentence. The provided information in the first sentence does not prove or support the scenario described in the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Solve -6*g - 18 - 18 = 0 for g.","completion":"To solve the equation -6*g - 18 - 18 = 0 for g, we will proceed step-by-step using algebraic techniques. Here is the given equation: -6*g - 18 - 18 = 0 Step 1: Combine the like terms. The like terms in this equation are the constant terms, -18 and -18. We will add them together: -6*g - 36 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term (in this case, -6*g), we need to move the constant term (-36) to the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 36 to both sides of the equation: -6*g - 36 + 36 = 0 + 36 This simplifies to: -6*g = 36 Step 3: Solve for the variable g. Now, to solve for g, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -6: (-6*g) / -6 = 36 / -6 This simplifies to: g = -6 So, the solution to the equation -6*g - 18 - 18 = 0 is g = -6."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hope Logan is the daughter of Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe. Over the years, the character's various storylines have showcased her relationships with Liam Spencer and Wyatt Fuller, her conflicts with Steffy Forrester, and her life as part of the fashion industry. The role of Hope has been played by the following actresses: 1. Rachel Ryals (2002): As a child, Hope was portrayed by Rachel Ryals during her initial introduction. Rachel Ryals solely appeared when Hope Logan was a baby. 2. Amanda and Rachel Pace (2004-2009): Twins Amanda and Rachel Pace took over the role of child Hope in 2004. The Pace sisters shared the role until 2009, with their most notable storylines involving the kidnapping of baby Hope by Sheila Carter and the revelation of Deacon Sharpe as Hope's biological father. 3. Kimberly Matula (2010-2016): In 2010, Kimberly Matula assumed the role of Hope Logan as a teenager and remained in the role until 2016. Matula's portrayal was prominent during Hope's tumultuous love life involving Liam Spencer, Wyatt Fuller, and Oliver Jones. She also navigated Hope's professional aspirations and rivalry with Steffy Forrester. Matula was nominated four times for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress for her work in the role. 4. Annika Noelle (2018-present): Annika Noelle took over as Hope in January 2018 and continues to portray the character today.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we need to analyze and compare the meaning and context of both sentences. Sentence 1: Sacre! he murmured. In this sentence, the subject, assumed to be a person, utters the exclamation \\"Sacre!\\" (an emphatic French expression used to show surprise, irritation, or admiration). The manner in which it is being communicated is through a murmur, which is a soft, low, and barely audible sound. This suggests that the person is likely speaking to themselves or expressing an inner thought, as murmuring is a more restrained and less attention-grabbing way of speaking. Sentence 2: \\"Sacre!\\" he said to himself. In the second sentence, it is clear that the person is also expressing the same exclamation \\"Sacre!\\" However, the manner in which the exclamation is being communicated here is different. Instead of murmuring, the exclamation is simply \\"said\\" to himself. While this could still be interpreted as the person speaking softly, it could also imply that the person is speaking in a regular tone or volume. The second sentence confirms that the person is explicitly talking to themselves or expressing an inner thought, unlike in the first sentence where this was only implied. Based on the comparison of these two sentences, it is possible that they could be describing the same situation, which would mean that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence would also be true. However, we must also consider that there are differences in the manner of communication, with the first sentence involving a murmur while the second sentence not specifying the volume. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can be true but not necessarily. The second sentence may not be entirely accurate due to the difference in the way \\"Sacre!\\" is expressed (murmuring versus just saying). The truthfulness of the second sentence will depend on the precise context and understanding of the situation. It is crucial to have more information about the circumstance to make a definitive statement about the truth of the second sentence when only the first sentence is confirmed to be true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mary seems upset and frustrated because they are attending an event where Becky, a person close to them, will be singing in just five minutes. Mary is physically present at the event, but Jacob is not. Jacob is running late because he has encountered some traffic, which affects his arrival time and delays his attendance at the event. He apologizes for his tardiness and tries to justify it by mentioning the traffic. Despite his explanation, Mary appears to be uninterested in the reason behind Jacob's lateness and believes that it is Jacob's responsibility to explain the situation to Becky. The conversation suggests that Mary cares about Becky's performance and wants to make sure that everyone important, like Jacob, is there to support her. Jacob's absence seems to be causing tension between Mary and him, which makes Mary demand an explanation on behalf of their friend Becky. Mary ultimately decides to cut the conversation short, possibly because she is annoyed at Jacob or wants to focus on Becky's performance instead of their discussion.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Question: People are unlikely to survive under the body temperature _ .

During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1] At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out.

The Sun's gravity, pressure, and nuclear reactions are solely determined by its mass, composition, and properties. The underwater environment of the person does not interact with the Sun's internal processes in any notable way.

Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not. But I can use this background: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. What is an answer for this question: Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics? Answer:","completion":"Manny, the health-conscious friend who only consumed organic foods and organic milk, drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics. This is because organic farming practices do not allow the use of antibiotics as a preventative measure, resulting in a lower presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens on organic farms. Therefore, the organic milk he consumed would have come from cows that were less likely to have been treated with antibiotics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Given the following passage \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder? Answer:","completion":"In the passage, Thomas Sowell, a libertarian economist, discusses the negative results of affirmative action in his book Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. According to Sowell, affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people – who are considered part of the non-preferred groups – to work harder. This disincentive occurs because these individuals may feel that no matter how hard they work or how well they perform, they might still be overlooked in favor of individuals from preferred groups (such as certain minority populations) due to the policies in place. Consequently, poor white individuals may perceive their efforts as futile under affirmative action programs, leading them to be less motivated to strive for excellence or improve their performance. Such a perception ultimately contributes to a net loss for society as a whole, as it diminishes the overall performance and competitive nature of the workforce. Additionally, Sowell notes that affirmative action can also generate animosity towards the preferred groups, potentially exacerbating social tensions and divisions."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on milton gonçalves 's: - birth date - name - image - birth place - occupation Bio: milton gonçalves -lrb- ; born in monte santo , minas gerais , brazil , on december 9 , 1933 -rrb- is a brazilian actor . he worked in many telenovelas , including \`\` a cabana do pai tomás '' , \`\` irmãos coragem '' , \`\` o bem amado '' , \`\` o espigão '' , \`\` pecado capital '' , \`\` sinal de alerta '' , \`\` o pulo do gato '' , \`\` baila comigo '' , \`\` partido alto '' , \`\` mandala '' , \`\` araponga '' and \`\` felicidade '' . he has also worked as director in \`\` escrava isaura '' and \`\` o bem amado '' . milton gonçalves is one of the most famous black actors in brazil , having collaborated twice with acclaimed director hector babenco . one notable role with babenco was that alongside william hurt and raúl juliá as a homophobic police chief in \`\` kiss of the spider woman '' . gonçalves started his career in são paulo , in an amateur group . as he moved to a professional group , he met augusto boal , who was looking for an actor to play an old black man . joining boal 's teatro de arena , milton gonçalves found an open environment for political , philosophical and artistic discussion , where he was not discriminated for his race . gonçalves wrote four plays , one of which was staged by the \`\` teatro experimental do negro '' and directed by dalmo ferreira . \`\` there i learnt everything i know about theater . it was fundamental for my comprehension of the world .

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Andrew is drinking a glass of cold water. He gets a straw and puts it in the water then gets back to work. After a while he looks over and notices water has begun to group under the bend in the straw even though the bend is above the surface of the water. and a hint : Another important physical property of water, is adhesion . In terms of water, adhesion is the bonding of a water molecule to another substance, such as the sides of a leaf's veins. This process happens because hydrogen bonds are special in that they break and reform with great frequency. This constant rearranging of hydrogen bonds allows a percentage of all the molecules in a given sample to bond to another substance. This grip-like characteristic that water molecules form causes capillary action , the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow space. An example of capillary action is when you place a straw into a glass of water. The water seems to climb up the straw before you even place your mouth on the straw. The water has created hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, causing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw. As the hydrogen bonds keep interchanging with the straw's surface, the water molecules interchange positions and some begin to ascend the straw. Please answer this question : Will the amount of water gathered at this bend increase or decrease given enough time? Answer:","completion":"Given enough time, the amount of water gathered at the bend in the straw will likely increase. This is due to the process of capillary action, which causes water to flow against gravity in narrow spaces like the straw. The water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, allowing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw and ascend. As time passes, the constant rearrangement of hydrogen bonds leads to water molecules interchanging positions and continuing to rise up the straw. This process allows more water molecules to gather at the bend in the straw, as they are not only moved upwards by capillary action but also have a strong adhesive force with the straw's surface. Therefore, the amount of water gathered at the bend is likely to increase over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film, based on actual events, follows Coach Carter as he strives to reform the team both on and off the court, instilling discipline, accountability, and the importance of academics. Despite facing numerous obstacles, the young players progress into a force to be reckoned with, eventually earning the opportunity to compete for the state championship title. Plot: The film opens with a panoramic view of the struggling Regis High School, located in an underprivileged neighborhood plagued with poverty and gang violence. We see Coach Robert Carter, a former pro basketball player, walking up to the school for his first day as the new basketball coach. As he observes the rundown facilities and scruffy students, he knows he has his work cut out for him. Carter takes over the boys' varsity basketball team, which has been experiencing a losing streak for several years. The team is composed of talented yet undisciplined players, many on the verge of dropping out due to poor academic performance. Coach Carter quickly realizes that for these young men to succeed, they need more than just basketball skills. Thus, he begins to implement strict practice schedules and demanding academic standards. The players are initially resistant to these new demands, believing that their future lies solely in basketball. Coach Carter pushes them to see value in their education, emphasizing that it will open more doors for them in the future. The story delves into the lives of various players, portraying their struggles with broken homes, peer pressure, and dangerous affiliations. Through perseverance, Coach Carter gradually earns the respect of the players and their families. Even some of the more problematic players turn their lives around, with several obtaining scholarships to prestigious colleges.

John liked the areas in his old town a lot better than the locations in his new town, because the","completion":"former held a lot of sentimental value and provided a sense of comfort and familiarity, whereas the latter seemed more alien and impersonal, making it difficult for him to feel at ease and fully embrace his new surroundings. Growing up in his old town, John had formed countless memories and connections that made the various areas in the town feel like an essential part of his life. The local park where he would spend hours playing with his childhood friends, the quaint little café that served the best hot chocolate in town, and the community center where he took his first guitar lessons – all these places shaped his formative years and defined his identity. Consequently, the nostalgic attachment he had to these locations made it seem as though they were a part of him, and whenever he visited those familiar spots, a wave of warmth and homeliness would wash over him, filling his heart with a sense of belonging. Contrastingly, John struggled to forge similar bonds with the locations in his new town, as he was yet to create meaningful experiences or form lasting friendships there. Although the new town boasted of advanced infrastructure and modern architecture, the glossy sheen of the new shopping mall or the state-of-the-art sports complex did little to evoke the same emotional response that the humble establishments in his old town did. As he ventured out to explore the unfamiliar alleys and attractions in the hopes of finding a sense of camaraderie and connection, he couldn't help but feel isolated and disconnected from this environment that seemed so foreign to him. Apart from the lack of emotional attachment, John also grappled with the practical challenges of adapting to a new location. Navigating the new town's streets became a daily ordeal, as he didn't have the luxury of his muscle memory guiding him through the maze of turns and landmarks that he was so accustomed to in his old town. Furthermore, trying to establish a new network of personal and professional relationships proved to be a daunting task, as the residents of the new town seemed distant and less approachable compared to the warm and friendly community he grew up with. In conclusion, John's fondness for the areas in his old town stems from the deep-rooted sentimental value, and the emotional connection formed through years of shared experiences and memories that made the town feel like an extension of himself. Despite the potential benefits and opportunities presented by his new town, the unfamiliarity and absence of a sense of belonging made it difficult for John to appreciate the locations in his new town as much as he treasured the ones in his old town. It would likely take time, persistence, and a willingness to create new memories and connections for John to eventually grow as fond of his new home as he once was of his old one."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson told the Boston Globe that Kerry will promptly pay the fine. He said shovelers finished clearing the sidewalk late Thursday morning. Clean-up: In Massachusetts a man uses a snow blower in a bid to clear the roads in the aftermath of Juno. Worrying outlook: A forecast shows snow engulfing large swathes of New England towards New York and Northern Michigan on Friday. The Herald carries a statement from Kerry's office which read: 'Diplomats — they’re just like us. Secretary Kerry was working overseas while the blizzard packed a wallop back home, and unfortunately his snow removal company misconstrued yellow hazard tape along the sidewalk — put up to warn of falling snow and ice overhead — as police tape and thought that part of the sidewalk was off limits. 'Once they understood they were allowed to enter the area the contractors finished the sidewalk late (this) morning. The snow has all been shoveled now, the Secretary will gladly pay the ticket, and let’s hope this is the last blizzard of the year.' But forecasters have warned that New England is expected to be hit with storm-force winds and up to 18 inches of snow today. A heavy storm warning has been issued for Maine and parts of New Hampshire and Massachusetts north of Boston from this morning through to Saturday night. Residents have been told to travel only in emergencies. The National Weather Service said drifting snow driven by strong winds could make travel life-threatening. Efforts to clear the 3 feet of snow that fell earlier this week have been put on hold.

He was away in another country for work, so he couldn't do it himself. The city officials, who are the people who make sure everyone follows the rules, decided to give him a small punishment called a fine, which means he has to pay 50 dollars. They wanted to make sure everyone keeps the sidewalks safe and clean for people walking during the snowy weather. John Kerry said he will pay the fine and hopes there won't be any more big snowstorms this year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history. - Angers is a city in western France, about southwest of Paris.

But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. Can we infer the following? The sanctity of marriage also includes common-law unions.","completion":"To infer whether the sanctity of marriage includes common-law unions, we need to first examine the key components of both the given statement and the concept of common-law unions, and then assess the compatibility between the two. Based on the given statement, it is evident that the speaker strongly believes in the sanctity of marriage and emphasizes the importance of protecting the institution of marriage between a man and a woman. Sanctity, in this context, refers to the sacredness, holiness, or inviolability of the marital relationship. Common-law unions, on the other hand, are arrangements where two people cohabit and live together in a long-term relationship without obtaining a formal legal marriage. Generally, common-law partners have many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as married couples, although the specifics may vary depending on the jurisdiction. Common-law relationships are an alternative to the traditional institution of marriage. So, can we infer that the sanctity of marriage includes common-law unions as well? It depends on the perspective. From the speaker's point of view, the sanctity of marriage seems to be preserved in the institution of marriage itself, which only includes unions between a man and a woman. As they appreciate the significance and sacredness of the bond between married couples, they may not consider common-law unions on the same footing due to the lack of formal recognition, thus potentially excluding them from the sanctity of marriage according to their beliefs. From a broader perspective, the sanctity of marriage may still be attributed to common-law unions if one is willing to consider the essence of the bond between the two partners rather than the formal structure. The sacredness of a relationship might be more about the love, commitment, and emotional connection that the couple shares, regardless of whether their union has been legally formalized. In this case, the emotional bond and connection between common-law partners are just as strong as those between married couples, and can still uphold the sanctity traditionally associated with marriage. Ultimately, whether or not the sanctity of marriage extends to common-law unions is subjective and depends on the individual's perspective and cultural, religious, or philosophical views. In summary, it cannot be definitively inferred from the given statement and may call for further clarification or discussion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: How do I sell a car to the government? Selling a car to the government could be a good option, as they're often in need of various types of vehicles for different purposes. Here's a detailed approach to selling a vehicle to the government: 1. Identify the appropriate government agency: Research which agency or department of the government would be most interested in purchasing your car. This could include local government entities, such as county or city departments, as well as state or federal agencies. 2. Register as a government contractor: To sell your car to the government, you'll need to register as a contractor. This process varies depending on the country you live in. In the United States, register your business with the System for Award Management (SAM) at sam.gov. 3. Find bidding opportunities: There are multiple platforms where governments post their requirements for goods and services. In the United States, you can search on websites like beta.SAM.gov or fbo.gov (Federal Business Opportunities) depending on the level of government you are targeting. Look out for vehicle procurement requests and make note of relevant opportunities. 4. Prepare your bid proposal: Carefully read the specifications and requirements outlined in the procurement request. Outline the details of your vehicle, including its make, model, year, mileage, features, and how it meets the needs specified by the agency soliciting bids. 5. Submit your bid: Complete and submit the bid proposal by the deadline indicated in the procurement request, including any additional documentation requested such as proof of ownership, maintenance records, or warranties. 6. Await the results: Once your bid has been submitted, wait for the contracting agency to evaluate all bids and make a decision. If your bid is successful, you will be contacted by the agency to arrange the transfer of the vehicle and payment. Note that government procurement processes can be time-consuming and competitive, so patience and persistence are essential. This process may not be the fastest way to sell a car, but it can open doors to new business opportunities and potential contracts. Second question: What is the fastest way to sell a car? The fastest way to sell a car differs from selling a car to the government, as it often involves targeting individual buyers or private entities. Here are some tips for quickly selling a car: 1. Price your car correctly: Research your car's market value based on its age, make, model, and overall condition. Price your car competitively to attract potential buyers. 2. Advertise through multiple channels: Utilize online platforms such as Craigslist, AutoTrader, eBay Motors, or social media groups. Place ads in local newspapers and post flyers at community bulletin boards. 3. Take high-quality photos: Capture clear and well-lit pictures of your car's exterior and interior from various angles. This visual presentation can significantly impact buyer interest. 4. Be honest and transparent: Highlight your car's selling points, but don't shy away from disclosing any issues or problems. Being upfront with potential buyers fosters trust and expedites the selling process. 5. Prepare your car for sale: Make sure your car is clean, looks good, and is in good working order. Address any minor repairs or maintenance issues to maximize its selling potential. 6. Offer flexible payment options: Be open to accepting multiple payment methods, such as cash, cashier's check, or money order. Offering flexibility can help close a deal faster. 7. Be available and responsive: Respond promptly to inquiries from potential buyers and be available for appointments to view or test-drive the vehicle. In conclusion, selling a car to the government and finding the fastest way to sell a car are not the same thing. The first option requires engaging with government procurement processes, while the second focuses on targeting individual buyers or private entities for a quick sale. Both approaches have their own benefits and challenges, and the choice between them depends on your specific goals and circumstances."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Holy Land (Hebrew: , ; Arabic: ) is an area roughly located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River.

Hyderabad: After India gained independence, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union. The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession, which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until 31 October 1956. Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region. The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar, then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location. Since 1956, the Rashtrapati Nilayam in Hyderabad has been the second official residence and business office of the President of India; the President stays once a year in winter and conducts official business particularly relating to Southern India.

Christine, who had always been Cynthia's confidant and emotional rock, warmly welcomed her friend into her home, offering her a cup of hot tea and a safe space to unload her pent-up feelings. As they settled comfortably into the cozy living room, Cynthia recounted the story of her tumultuous relationship with her ex-partner. She spoke of both the highlights and the low moments they shared, emphasizing the love and passion they once had for each other, which made the break-up all the more painful. Tears welled up in her eyes as she explained how the constant disagreements and the feeling of being emotionally drained finally led her to make the hard decision to end their relationship. Christine listened attentively, her heart aching for her friend's pain. She knew all too well the emotional turmoil that comes with the end of a significant relationship, remembering her own heartbreak just a few years prior. When Cynthia finally finished pouring her heart out, Christine knew it was essential to offer honest, supportive advice to help her navigate through this difficult time. Drawing from her own experiences and wisdom, Christine reminded Cynthia that healing from a break-up is not a linear process, and it is entirely normal to feel regret and self-doubt. She emphasized the importance of giving herself time and space to process her emotions and the reasons behind her decision, ensuring her that the guilt and sadness she felt are merely temporary aspects of the healing journey. Furthermore, Christine encouraged Cynthia to surround herself with loving and supportive friends and family members, as having a strong support network goes a long way in helping one heal after a break-up. She also advised Cynthia to engage in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and journaling, to help her deal with her emotions in a healthy and productive manner. Lastly, Christine emphasized the importance of self-compassion and urged Cynthia not to blame herself for the break-up. Instead, she should recognize that relationships are a two-way street, and both parties contribute to its successes and failures. By doing so, Cynthia could eventually come to terms with the fact that, despite the pain it ultimately caused, the break-up may have been the best decision for both her and her ex-partner's well-being and future happiness. As the conversation came to an end, Cynthia felt a sense of relief and gratitude for having Christine as a friend. Despite the lingering pain from her break-up, she felt stronger and more equipped to handle the challenges and emotions that lay ahead.

Saqib Hussain, 25, was speeding in the hired Audi R8 Spyder in a 30mph zone when he crashed into a Ford Fiesta carrying two sisters at 11.30pm on August 26 last year. The car can be seen (left) just moments before the crash. The court was shown CCTV footage of the moment the hit the bright blue Ford at over two-and-a-half times the speed limit. The court heard Hussain crashed his Audi R8 into a Ford Fiesta carrying Noreen Ryan, Birmingham. Hussain, from Birmingham, was handed a six year prison sentence at the same court. Jailing him Judge Peter Carr said: 'You showed flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and were a danger to everybody on them. 'You have since said it was your fantasy to drive the car and that you were testing its capabilities, but it seems to me you were showing off. 'The words from the family do not even come close to adequately describing the pain and grief that they feel for the loss of Noreen.' Emergency services were forced to cut off the roof of the super-mini to free it’s trapped occupants. Investigators found Hussain had been driving at at last 76mph when he spotted the oncoming car and began to brake.

Investigators found Hussain had been driving at at last 76mph when he spotted the oncoming car and began to brake. The court heard Hussain had picked up the keys of the car of the hired car from a table at a family wedding and had 'fantasised' about driving such a powerful car. Prosecutor Joanne Barker told the court: 'Mary Ryan was not at fault in any way for what happened that night. 'Had he [Hussain] been travelling at the speed limit the collision would not have occurred. 'It is not the prosecution case he was racing with the Mercedes vehicle behind. 'The prosecution would submit he may well have been showing off. 'He did not adjust his speed despite seeing her. He was going too fast to do anything about it.' After the crash Hussain climbed out of the wreckage and said to an injured Mary: 'I’m sorry it’s not your fault, it’s mine.' Hussain and passenger Faizal Wahid, who suffered a broken cheekbone, jaw and eye socket and is now paralysed down the left side of his face, both fled the scene.

Robert Cowley, defending, said Hussain had shown genuine remorse for what he had done. Before the crash he said he would have been described as a 'decent, hardworking, polite and respectable individual.' A family tribute to Noreen, the youngest of her seven brothers and sisters, described her as the 'heart, spark and soul' of her family. It said: 'Birmingham City was Noreen’s passion in life and she was a season ticket holder who never missed a match. 'But her family was also very important to her and she was a much-loved stepmother, step grandmother, daughter, sister and aunty to her nieces and nephews. 'Noreen was the heart, spark and soul of her family. She was overgenerous and loved buying presents at Christmas and birthdays. 'She enjoyed a glass of prosecco with the girls and had a great sense of humour and some fantastic one-liners. 'She had watched all of Birmingham City’s home matches with her brother John since they were kids. She always had the last word on football debates.'

Q:Given the following context: Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Now, I have a new situation: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Answer this question please: Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels? A:","completion":"In the given situation where Mike lives in a cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, darker coated squirrels would have a greater chance of survival than lighter squirrels. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. The environment is cold, and darker coats are more suitable in cold environments due to their better heat absorption capabilities. Darker colors absorb more heat from sunlight, which helps the squirrels stay warm in the cold environment. 2. There is not much predator-prey interaction in the city, so the primary factor impacting squirrel survival is related to the cold climate and not to camouflage for protection against predators. If predator-prey interaction were a significant factor, the coat color that provided better camouflage might be the more advantageous trait. 3. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment, like the darker coat in this case, will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. 4. As a result of these factors, the population of darker coated squirrels would be more likely to grow over time, as they are better suited to the cold environment.

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Lackland Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base located in Bexar County, Texas.

It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare.

When the universe was young, there was only gas and dust. From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons. It also formed our Sun. This force caused more than just our solar system to form. It caused all the other solar systems to form. It caused the formation of all the galaxies of the universe.

Question: Given the following context: Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \\"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\\" Al Green agreed: \\"He broke the ice for all of us.\\" President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: \\"His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country.\\" Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the world.Presley's name, image, and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe. He has inspired a legion of impersonators. In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans. \\"Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century\\", said composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein. \\"He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress. Jesse's Brother Mauricio (John Leguizamo) also arrives,... My question: Why was Edy getting calls from his doctor?","completion":"The plot provided in your question does not specify any information about Edy, a character in the movie \\"Nothing Like the Holidays\\", receiving calls from his doctor. We know from the plot summary that Edy Rodriguez, portrayed by Alfred Molina, is the father of Jesse Rodriguez. He is seen preparing a welcome home sign for his son, Jesse, who is returning home from service in Iraq. Later, he proceeds to his store, a local neighborhood supermarket, known as Bodega. There he appears to be popular among the ladies. However, there is no mention in this particular plot summary about Edy receiving calls from his doctor, nor is there any implication or clue given regarding such an event. If there were a subplot in the film where Edy was dealing with a health issue that required him to receive calls from his doctor, it is not mentioned or alluded to in the presented summary. It could be that this is a detail in another part of the film that wasn't included in the plot summary. To best answer your question, one would need more information or context.

I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. Just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that I've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime, I decided to give \\"Erendira\\" another look. And I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film. The story is about a teenaged girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother, played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas, forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages. The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though, inspite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which, by the way, is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico. The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a David Lynch film. It's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments from previous viewers below... Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of the rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb. The film moves at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again, just because it makes you want to do that. For me anyway, it really is that compelling. Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: \\"El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba.\\" (\\"The world's not as big as I thought\\" - i.e., It's a small world.) This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one.

Information: - Lancy is a municipality of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. - The Republic and Canton of Geneva (; ) is the French-speaking westernmost canton or state of Switzerland, surrounded on almost all sides by France. As is the case in several other Swiss cantons (e.g. Ticino, Neuchâtel, and Jura), this canton is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation. - A photographer (the Greek (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\") is a person who makes photographs. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots. - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth.

(CNN) -- Eight people in China have been indicted for their roles in an attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday, citing local authorities. Authorities in the restive Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in western China accused the suspects of organizing, leading and participating as a terrorist group and endangering public security. The people were indicted Friday. The eight are to stand trial in Urumqi, the capital of the region, where Chinese authorities have cracked down on violence involving Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The Tiananmen incident occurred October 28, when a vehicle drove through security barriers into a crowd in the square. It crashed into a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and burst into flames. The attack killed five people, including three in the vehicle, and wounded 40 others. In response, police in Xinjiang launched a crackdown on extremist groups, arresting 200 suspects and seizing hundreds of explosive devices,","completion":"knives, and other weapons. The authorities have sought to establish stronger security measures and communication mechanisms across the region to prevent such attacks in the future. The investigation concluded that the suspects were heavily influenced by extremist ideologies and orchestrated the attack as a deliberate act of terrorism against the government and innocent civilians. Law enforcement agencies have since intensified their efforts to track down the masterminds behind the attack and dismantle local and international networks involved in fostering terrorism within the region. Facing widespread public outrage and condemnation from the international community, the Chinese government has vowed to take effective measures to ensure that such incidents are not repeated. This includes strengthening efforts to spread the message of peace and unity, investing in programs aimed at socio-economic development of the Uyghur communities, and creating opportunities for dialogue between different ethnic and religious groups to foster understanding and trust. As part of these initiatives, the Chinese government has also pledged to increase vigilance and cooperation with neighboring countries and international organizations to contain the spread of extremism and terrorism in the region. By sharing intelligence and resources, governments and security agencies can enhance their capability to combat these threats and protect citizens from violent attacks. The trial of the eight suspects in Urumqi is set to commence shortly, and the proceedings will surely be closely monitored by the international community. The outcome of this trial may serve as a reminder of the severity of the challenge posed by terrorism, and the need for sustained efforts by governments and societies to address the root causes of such violence. In conclusion, the Chinese authorities must continue to strive for a comprehensive and enduring solution to the unrest in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. By promoting social cohesion, economic development, and interfaith dialogue among the diverse communities in the region, they can hope to forge a more harmonious and peaceful society, where acts of terror, like the tragic attack on Tiananmen Square in October, are a thing of the past. It is only through united efforts by governments, local communities, and the international community that the threat of terrorism can be effectively countered and the safety and well-being of all citizens be guaranteed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. Born and raised in Marshall, Texas, to Alma and Yelberton Abraham Tittle Sr., Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. aspired to be a quarterback from a young age. He spent hours in his backyard throwing a football through a tire swing, emulating his neighbor and boyhood idol, Sammy Baugh. Tittle played high school football at Marshall High School. In his senior year the team posted an undefeated record and reached the state finals. After a recruiting battle between Louisiana State University and the University of Texas, Tittle chose to attend LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and play for the LSU Tigers. He was part of a successful 1944 recruiting class under head coach Bernie Moore that included halfbacks Jim Cason, Dan Sandifer, and Ray Coates. Freshmen were eligible to play on the varsity during World War II, so Tittle saw playing time immediately. He later said the finest moment of his four years at LSU was beating Tulane as a freshman, a game in which he set a school record with 238 passing yards. It was one of two games the Tigers won that season. Moore started Tittle at tailback in the single-wing formation his first year, but moved him to quarterback in the T formation during his sophomore season. As a junior in 1946, Tittle's three touchdown passes in a 41-27 rout of rival Tulane helped ensure LSU a spot in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Known notoriously as the \\"Ice Bowl\\", the 1947 Cotton Bowl pitted LSU against the Arkansas Razorbacks in sub-freezing temperatures on an ice-covered field in Dallas, Texas. LSU moved the ball much better than the Razorbacks, but neither team was able to score, and the game ended in a 0-0 tie. Tittle and Arkansas end Alton Baldwin shared the game's MVP award. Following the season, United Press International (UPI) placed Tittle on its All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) first-team. UPI again named Tittle its first-team All-SEC quarterback in 1947. In Tittle's day of iron man football, he played on both offense and defense. While on defense during a 20-18 loss to SEC champion Ole Miss in his senior season, Tittle's belt buckle was torn off as he intercepted a pass from Charlie Conerly and broke a tackle. He ran down the sideline with one arm cradling the ball and the other holding up his pants. At the Ole Miss 20-yard line, as he attempted to stiff-arm a defender, Tittle's pants fell and he tripped and fell onto his face. The fall kept him from scoring the game-winning touchdown. In total, during his college career Tittle set school passing records with 162 completions out of 330 attempts for 2,525 yards and 23 touchdowns. He scored seven touchdowns himself as a runner. His passing totals remained unbroken until Bert Jones surpassed them in the 1970s. Entity:","completion":"Y. A. Tittle"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: LISBON, Portugal – President Barack Obama won NATO summit agreement Friday to build a missile shield over Europe, an ambitious commitment to protect against Iranian attack while demonstrating the alliance's continuing relevance — but at the risk of further aggravating Russia. On another major issue, Obama and the allies are expected to announce plans on Saturday to begin handing off security responsibility in Afghanistan to local forces next year and to complete the transition by the end of 2014. That end date is three years beyond the time that Obama has said he will start withdrawing U.S. troops, and the challenge is to avoid a rush to the exits as public opinion turns more sharply against the war and Afghan President Hamid Karzai pushes for greater Afghan control. While celebrating the missile shield decision, Obama also made a renewed pitch for Senate ratification back in the U.S. of a nuclear arms treaty with Russia, asserting that Europeans believe rejection of the deal would hurt their security and damage relations with the Russians. Two key unanswered questions about the missile shield — will it work and can the Europeans afford it? — were put aside for the present in the interest of celebrating the agreement as a boost for NATO solidarity. \\"It offers a role for all of our allies,\\" Obama told reporters. \\"It responds to the threats of our times. It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles.\\" He did not mention Iran by name, acceding to the wishes of NATO member Turkey, which had threatened to block the deal if its neighbor was singled out. Under the arrangement, a limited system of U.S. anti-missile interceptors and radars already planned for Europe — to include interceptors in Romania and Poland and possibly a radar in Turkey — would be linked to expanded European-owned missile defenses. That would create a broad system that protects every NATO country against medium-range missile attack. NATO plans to invite Russia to join the missile shield effort, although Moscow would not be given joint control. The gesture would mark a historic milestone for the alliance, created after World War II to defend Western Europe against the threat of an invasion by Soviet forces. As for the U.S.-Russia arms treaty, Obama was backed by NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark, who told reporters that the treaty, called New START and signed last April by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, would improve security not only in Europe but beyond. \\"I would strongly regret if it is delayed,\\" Fogh Rasmussen said. \\"A delay would be damaging for security in Europe, and I urge all parties involved to ratify it.\\" Obama needs 67 votes in the Senate for ratification, and many Republicans have balked at even taking a vote before the new, more heavily GOP Congress convenes in January. The allies opened their summit by agreeing on the first rewrite of NATO's basic mission — formally called its \\"strategic concept\\" — since 1999. They reaffirmed their bedrock commitment that an attack on one would be treated as an attack on all. In that context, the agreement to build a missile defense for all of Europe is meant to strengthen the alliance. What remains in conflict, however, is the question of the future role of nuclear weapons in NATO's basic strategy. The document members agreed to Friday says NATO will retain an \\"appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities\\" to deter a potential aggressor. Germany and some other NATO members want U.S. nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe. Non-government advocates of the German view were quick to criticize what they saw as a missed opportunity here for further nuclear disarmament. \\"In an astonishing demonstration of weakness, NATO heads of state have failed to tackle the Cold War legacy of the deployment of U.S. nuclear gravity bombs in Europe, threatening the credibility of NATO members' claims to be interested in non-proliferation and global disarmament,\\" said Paul Ingram, executive director of the British American Security Information Council in London. The specter of continued stalemate in Afghanistan hung over the Lisbon summit. Karzai will be joining the NATO allies for the Saturday session, and Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, is to make a closed-door presentation spelling out his vision of how to make a transition to Afghan control. Petraeus is expected to emphasize that stepped-up military operations this year, with the addition of thousands more U.S. combat troops, have made strides toward weakening the Taliban and eventually creating the conditions for peace negotiations. But he also is believed to be concerned that the transition not turn into a departure before Afghanistan is stable. Obama said Afghanistan, launch pad for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, must get ready for the start of a shift away from reliance on U.S. and NATO combat power \\"as we move toward a new phase, a transition to Afghan responsibility beginning in 2011 with Afghan forces taking the lead for security across Afghanistan by 2014.\\" A key question: Will Afghan security forces and the central government be ready to take full responsibility by then? Mark Sedwill, the top NATO civilian official in Afghanistan, told reporters in Lisbon that it was possible the transition could be completed before 2014, although it's not yet clear whether even that date will mark the end of NATO combat there. A member of Karzai's delegation to the summit, former Afghan finance minister Ashraf Ghani, said in an Associated Press interview that once 2014 is set as the target date, NATO needs to work with Kabul to establish milestones to get there. \\"We as Afghans are responsive to our public opinion, and our public opinion is raising these issues, and what is fortunate is now, NATO has become ... a listening organization,\\" Ghani said on the sidelines of the summit. Stating the U.S. view in clear terms, Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell had said Thursday that 2014 is an \\"aspirational goal,\\" not a deadline either for Afghan forces to take full control or for a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met privately with Karzai on Friday, said earlier that despite the economic burdens faced by much of Europe and the U.S., she believes the war campaign must go on. \\"The challenge posed by radical extremists who utilize terror to promote their agenda is one that threatens the people of Portugal, the people of Europe, the people of the United States and, indeed, nations around the world,\\" Clinton said. Her comments seemed aimed at slowing any rush to withdrawal by allies who believe military force is not the solution in Afghanistan. Canada, for example, is ending its combat mission next year while keeping 950 troops there in a support role. The summit comes in a pivotal period for NATO, whose relevance is questioned by some who view the alliance as a relic. The adversary that prompted NATO's creation in 1949 — the Soviet Union along with its Warsaw Pact allies — no longer exists. After NATO's rapid expansion over the past decade and a half — growing from 16 members to 28 — the gap in military prowess between the U.S. and most of the rest of the alliance has widened to the point where the basic nature of the defense partnership is in doubt. Rasmussen told Friday's opening session that it's time for NATO countries to start \\"cutting fat and investing in muscle.\\" This is where the U.S. push for a NATO missile defense comes in. It would require a lot of money from European countries — estimated at 200 million euros, or about 260 million, over 10 years — and a commitment to a more active type of defense. It also risks aggravating Russia, which has expressed worry that missile defenses could undermine the deterrent value of its own nuclear arsenal. Ivo Daalder, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, took a positive view of prospects for working with Moscow. \\"I believe we will find Russia and NATO will now decide that this is a time we move forward together on how to cooperate,\\" said Daalder, though he said Saturday's meetings weren't likely to result in concrete agreements on missile defense cooperation. Associated Press writers Slobodan Lekic, Alan Clendenning and Barry Hatton contributed to this report.

The assistant to the director manages all of the Director's in development, pre-production, while on set, through post-production and is often involved in both personal management as well as creative aspects of the production process. Historically, assistant to director was a stepping stone to directing work; Alfred Hitchcock was an AD, as was James McTeigue. This transition into film directing is no longer common in feature films. It is more common now for an assistant to the director to transition to a production management or producer role than to directing. - Lana Wachowski (formerly Laurence \\"Larry\\" Wachowski, born June 21, 1965) and Lilly Wachowski (formerly Andrew Paul \\"Andy\\" Wachowski, born December 29, 1967) are sister American film directors, screenwriters, and producers.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: they were shot for the following movie plot: In early 1943, World War II British prisoners arrive by train at a Japanese prison camp in Burma. The commandant, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), reminds Saito that the Geneva Conventions exempt officers from manual labour. At the following morning's assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men are sent off to work. Saito slaps him across the face with his copy of the conventions and threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton (James Donald), the British medical officer, intervenes, telling Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murdering the officers, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense tropical heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box. Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but United States Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), gets away, although badly wounded. He stumbles into a village of natives who help him leave by boat. Nicholson refuses to compromise. Meanwhile, the prisoners are working as little as possible and sabotaging whatever they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit ritual suicide. Desperate, Saito uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers from manual labor. Nicholson conducts an inspection and is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he allows Captain Reeves (Peter Williams) and Major Hughes (John Boxer) to design and build a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese, for the sake of maintaining his men's morale.

Article: If it is not available, you will be less tempted. Fueling yourself properly at the beginning of the day ensures that you don’t put your body in starvation mode by lunchtime. Starvation mode essentially means that your body holds on to fat, even if you don’t eat much. It also ensures that when you do eat, you will overindulge to compensate. Try to make sure your breakfast is balanced nutritionally, including a good source of protein. Many popular breakfasts are very carbohydrate-heavy with little protein, making you hungry much sooner. Make sure to take at least 20 minutes to eat your meal or snack. Eating slowly gives the brain a chance to be satisfied. Slow eating will help you avoid eating more than is necessary to feel full. Take the time to appreciate the foods that you are eating. You will receive more satisfaction out of your meal by savoring it than if you quickly scarf it down. Try replacing three large meals a day with six smaller meals. There is evidence that suggests an association between more eating occasions and lower BMI. The theory is that eating more frequently will help keep you fuller throughout your day because your energy levels will be more stable, as will your blood sugar levels. Try having protein at meals and snacks. This will help keep you full for longer periods of time. Beans, lean meats, and nuts are effective for this purpose. Consider eating a snack like cottage cheese before bed. Your body takes longer to break down the casein protein contained in cottage cheese; therefore, your metabolism will be working all night. Treating yourself with junk food once a week can undo all of your week’s hard work. One slice of cheesecake, for example, can be over 1,000 calories. If you really need something sweet, try eating a piece of fruit instead. Dessert usually consists of bad carbohydrates that also leave you feeling hungry quickly. If you want a frozen treat, try freezing grapes or blueberries. You can also mash a banana and add a teaspoon of honey for an ice cream-like treat. Restaurants focus on serving delicious food, not healthy food. Besides being tempted to order something you know is unhealthy, you may order something you think is healthy only to consume more calories than you thought.

Q:I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to make changes to their diets. Michael took this advice to heart, and reduced the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. Robert, on the other hand, continued to consume high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. But I can use this background: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. What is an answer for this question: Who will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Michael will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future. This is because he has made changes to his diet by reducing the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. These dietary changes help lower his LDL (\\"bad\\") cholesterol levels, which reduces the risk of plaque buildup and atherosclerosis. Additionally, if Michael incorporates regular aerobic exercise, this can further lower his LDL cholesterol and increase his HDL (\\"good\\") cholesterol, further decreasing his risk for atherosclerosis.

It is a useful tool for discovering which of your friends are nearby, so you can plan for meet-ups or events. The Nearby Friends feature works by utilizing the GPS technology on your smartphone. When you enable the Nearby Friends feature, your location will be shared with your friends who are also using the feature. This information is gathered from the location services on your phone, which uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi signals, and cell tower data to determine your precise location. This, in turn, helps Facebook display your friends on the map based on their proximity to you. Regarding the distance shown on Nearby Friends, Facebook considers a point-to-point (or straight line) distance rather than the distance by road. As such, the distance measured may not be the exact distance one would need to travel by foot, bike, or car, but it provides a reasonable estimate of how far apart you and your friends are in terms of proximity. The accuracy of Nearby Friends depends on various factors, including the quality of your phone's GPS and the strength of the Wi-Fi signals and cell tower reception in your area. Generally, the accuracy can range from a few meters to several hundred meters. It might not be perfect, but it usually provides a good approximation of your friends' locations.

Gregory John Norman AO (born 10 February 1955) is an Australian professional golfer and entrepreneur who spent 331 weeks as the world's Number 1 Official World Golf Rankings ranked golfer in the 1980s and 1990s. He has won 91 international tournaments, including 20 PGA Tour tournaments and two majors: The Open Championships in 1986 and 1993. Norman also earned thirty top-10 finishes and was the runner-up 8 times in majors throughout his career. Norman endured another setback at the 1987 Masters. In his final round on the 18th green, Norman had a 20-foot putt for a birdie that would win the tournament. The ball trickled over the left lip of the cup, missing by millimetres. After Norman's par on the 72nd hole at Augusta, he found himself in a sudden-death playoff with Larry Mize and Seve Ballesteros. On the second playoff hole, with Ballesteros eliminated, Mize holed a 47-yard (140-foot) chip to win the tournament. Norman did, however, win the Australian Masters in February 1987 and the Australian Open later in the year by a record ten shots at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, beating the previous Australian Open record winning margin of eight strokes by Jack Nicklaus in 1971. Norman's 1987 victory at the Australian Open lifted him back above Seve Ballesteros to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking. Norman had another four wins in Australia in 1988. In the U.S., Norman won the MCI Heritage Golf Classic at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina in April 1988, inspired by a leukemia-stricken teenager who got his wish to meet Norman and watch him play. The teenager was only supposed to watch the golfer for two rounds, but Norman arranged for him to stay until the tournament's completion. After the tournament, Norman awarded the teen with the trophy. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year. At the 1989 Masters, Norman missed a 12-foot par putt on the 72nd hole which would have put him into a playoff with Nick Faldo and Scott Hoch. Norman had another chance at a major in 1989, this time at the Open Championship at Royal Troon. He played a final-round of 64, starting his round with six straight birdies, to force his way into a playoff with Mark Calcavecchia and Wayne Grady. Going into the final playoff hole, Norman and Calcavecchia were tied, but two successive bunker shots by Norman gave Calcavecchia the victory. Norman won the Doral-Ryder Open and Memorial Tournament in March 1990 after having missed the cut for the first time at the 1990 Masters. In the 1990 Open Championship at St Andrews, Norman began with two rounds of 66, leaving himself sharing the lead with Nick Faldo after 36 holes and the pair four shots ahead of the rest of the field. Faldo then shot a third round of 67, but Norman could only manage 76. Norman finished the tournament tied for sixth place, while Faldo won by five shots. Although 1990 was not Norman's strongest majors year, he finished at the top of the PGA Tour money list for the second time in his career and won the Vardon Trophy and Byron Nelson Award. Later that year, he won the Australian Masters in his home country for a final and record sixth time.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: In 1987 to 1990 did he win any tournaments?","completion":"Yes, between 1987 and 1990, Gregory John Norman won several tournaments.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

His father was an oil-refinery refrigeration worker, and a skilled fiddle and accordion player, who often entertained in local New York City dance halls. By age twelve Rabbitt was a proficient guitar player, having been taught by his scoutmaster, Bob Scwickrath. During his childhood Rabbitt became a self-proclaimed \\"walking encyclopedia of country music\\". While he was still relatively unknown, Rabbitt toured with and opened for crossover star Kenny Rogers, and also opened for Dolly Parton on a number of dates during her 1978 tour, but soon Rabbitt would himself break through on other charts. Following the 1978 release of Variations, which included two more No. 1 hits, Rabbitt released his first compilation album, The Best of Eddie Rabbitt. The album produced Rabbitt's first crossover single of his career, \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\", which topped Country charts and reached the top 30 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary, and was featured in a 1978 Clint Eastwood movie of the same name. The song also broke the record for highest chart debut, entering at No. 18. Rabbitt held this record until it was shared with Garth Brooks at the debut of Brooks' 2005 single \\"Good Ride Cowboy.\\" The record was broken in 2006 upon the No. 17 chart entrance of Keith Urban's \\"Once in a Lifetime.\\" Rabbitt's next single, the R&B flavored \\"Suspicions\\" from his 1979 album Loveline, was an even greater crossover success, again reaching number one on Country charts and the top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary. He was given his own television special on NBC, first airing on July 10, 1980, which included appearances by such performers as Emmylou Harris and Jerry Lee Lewis. By this point in his career Rabbitt had been compared to a \\"young Elvis Presley.\\" Rabbitt's next album Horizon, which reached platinum status, contained the biggest crossover hits of his career including \\"I Love a Rainy Night\\" and \\"Drivin' My Life Away.\\" Rabbitt developed \\"Rainy Night\\" from a song fragment that he penned during a 1960s thunderstorm. \\"Driving\\" recalled Rabbitt's tenure as a truck driver, and was inspired by Bob Dylan's song \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" from Dylan's 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home. His popularity was so strong at this point that he was offered his own variety television show, which he went on to respectfully decline stating \\"It's not worth the gamble.\\" The release of his 1981 Step by Step album continued Rabbitt's crossover success as all three singles reached the top 10 on both Country and Adult Contemporary charts. The title track became Rabbitt's third straight single to reach the top 5 on Country, Adult Contemporary and the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The album ultimately reached gold status, Rabbitt's final album to do so. He teamed up with another country pop crossover star, Crystal Gayle, to record \\"You and I\\", which was included in his 1982 album Radio Romance. The duet reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country chart and eventually became a large pop smash, peaking at No. 7 and No. 2 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary chart. The song's popularity reached the point where it was used as a love theme for a couple on the soap opera All My Children. The song \\"You Put the Beat in My Heart\\" from Rabbitt's second Greatest Hits compilation in 1983 was his final crossover hit, reaching No. 15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. what kind of music was he doing before the crossover","completion":"Eddie Rabbitt was involved in Country music before he experienced crossover success. It's mentioned that he was a proficient guitar player by age twelve and became a self-proclaimed \\"walking encyclopedia of country music\\" during his childhood.

Would \\"Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"The lifespan of an individual with Down's syndrome varies depending on multiple factors such as genetics, health conditions, and access to medical care. In general, people with Down's syndrome have a shorter life expectancy compared to the general population. Over the past few decades, medical advancements and improved social support have contributed to a significant increase in life expectancy for individuals with Down's syndrome. Currently, the average life expectancy for a person with Down's syndrome is about 60 years, although some individuals live well into their 70s and beyond. The statement \\"Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated.\\" is a separate topic from the life expectancy of individuals with Down's syndrome. Prenatal testing, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, can detect Down's syndrome in a developing fetus. When a prenatal test shows a high probability of Down's syndrome, some parents may choose to terminate the pregnancy due to concerns about the child's quality of life, potential health complications, and the long-term financial and emotional impact on the family. However, this decision is deeply personal and varies widely among families, depending on their beliefs, culture, and resources. Down's syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to a range of physical and intellectual challenges, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, and an increased risk of certain health issues such as congenital heart defects, respiratory and hearing problems, Alzheimer's disease, and childhood leukemia. However, with appropriate support and interventions, individuals with Down's syndrome can lead fulfilling lives, participate in social activities, and, in some cases, hold jobs and live independently. Early intervention services, including special education, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy, can significantly improve cognitive and motor skills in individuals with Down's syndrome. Additionally, advances in medical care, such as corrective heart surgery and treatments for other health complications, have contributed to improved health outcomes and life expectancy. In summary, the lifespan of a Down's syndrome individual varies based on various factors, but in recent years, the life expectancy has increased to around 60 years on average. The decision to terminate a pregnancy with a Down's syndrome diagnosis is a separate, personal issue that varies among families. Medical and developmental support play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life and overall health and well-being for individuals with Down's syndrome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This means they have personal characteristics and can tolerate different things. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis Hypothesis: They are very normal. Analysis: The hypothesis describes the subjects as being very normal. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and hypothesis describe characteristics of the subjects. The premise focuses on their unique traits and tolerances, while the hypothesis claims they are very normal. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis In order to evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, we must determine if having unique quirks and tolerances can coexist with being very normal. While having unique traits could make someone more interesting or unusual, it does not necessarily mean they are abnormal. On the other hand, someone who is considered \\"very normal\\" may still have their own quirks and tolerances.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: While it can be surprising to encounter a snake while weeding your garden or walking around your yard, having a snake around isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, you should be proud - a good snake population in an area is a sign that the ecosystem there is healthy. In addition, snakes play an important role in keeping other pests, like mice and rats, from taking over. So if a snake isn't eating your chicken's eggs or otherwise being a bother, consider sharing your yard with it instead of trapping it and moving it elsewhere. Rat snakes and gopher snakes are especially beneficial to have around. They're as good as cats for keeping the rodent population down. King snakes go one step further and eat rattlesnakes. In fact, if you get rid of a king snake, the rattlesnakes are more likely to move in - and then you'll have a much more serious problem on your hands. If you don't like snakes, a great way to keep them away is to make your yard less snake-friendly. Snakes hang out in areas that are a little unkempt and wild. They like tall grass, brush piles, wood piles, and other sources of shelter. To make your yard less inviting, do the following: Mow the lawn regularly. Get rid of piles of rocks, leaves, brush, bricks, or anything else that a snake could use as shelter. Keep your rodent population down by cleaning up acorns, sealing your trash, and removing other sources of food for rodents. If you've been finding snakes in your attic or basement, look for cracks and holes that might be letting them in. Make sure the doors and windows are sealed around the edges. Screen the chimney, vents, and any other spots that could serve as an entryway for a snake. Snake experts seem to agree that most repellents aren't effective, but they might be worth a try if you've exhausted other ideas. Try putting one of the following substances in your garden, chicken coop or wherever you have a snake problem: Spray a solution made with fox urine around the perimeter of your property. Some say that snakes are deterred by the smell of their predators' urine. You can find this solution in home and garden stores. Try putting rags soaked in ammonia around the yard. This substance is said to repel snakes and other animals. Put human hair clippings around your garden. The smell of the hair is said to keep snakes away. Summary:","completion":"Encountering a snake in your garden or yard may initially be surprising, but having snakes around can actually be beneficial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Snakes are effective in controlling pest populations like mice and rats.

The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room.

In 2004, the city of New Haven introduced its first bike lane on Orange Street, which aimed to establish a connection between East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to the downtown area. This initiative was taken to promote the use of alternative transportation modes, as well as to enhance the accessibility and connectivity within the city. The East Rock neighborhood is a highly diverse and vibrant area in the city of New Haven, known for its rich culture, beautiful natural landscape, and the renowned East Rock Park. This park is a popular destination for city dwellers as well as residents from nearby areas, attracting thousands of visitors each year. With a multitude of recreational opportunities such as hiking trails, playing fields, picnic areas, the Soldiers and Sailors monument, fostering a connection between the neighborhood and downtown through the Orange Street bike lane was a significant step to enhance connectivity and encourage greener transportation practices. The Orange Street bike lane made it easier for residents of East Rock and visitors to East Rock Park to commute to and from the downtown area by providing a dedicated access route for cyclists. This bike lane serves as an integral part of the city’s cycling infrastructure and has contributed to improving the overall quality of life for many city residents. The better connected a neighborhood is to vital city centers, the more accessible jobs, services, and amenities become for the local population, in turn leading to a more thriving community overall. Since the inception of the Orange Street bike lane, New Haven has continued to expand its bike lane network and has made substantial efforts to improve overall bikeability within the city. These efforts not only support the increasing bicycle commuting population but also reflect the city’s commitment to promoting sustainable, environmentally friendly transportation choices for its residents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it. What kind of solids are gummi bears or taffy?","completion":"Gummi bears and taffy are examples of amorphous solids in scientific terms. An amorphous solid is a type of solid that lacks a well-defined ordered structure unlike crystalline solids which have a very regular structure pattern. Amorphous solids do not have a long-range periodic arrangement of their atoms or molecules. This is why they do not exhibit a definite geometric or crystal shape, or have definite melting point. The structural arrangement in gummi bears and taffies comes due to the complex, long, intertwined polymer chains. When we heat or chew these candies, energy supplied makes the polymer chains slide past each other, thus changing the shape of the candy without breaking it - a characteristic behavior of amorphous solids. Gummi bears are made primarily from a mixture of sugar, glucose syrup, starch, flavoring, food coloring, citric acid, and gelatin while taffy is made with sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, glycerin, water, butter, salt, flavor, and food color. These components, when mixed, heated and cooled in a proper controlled procedure provide the respective characteristics to these candies. So scientifically, gummi bears and taffy are considered to be amorphous solids rather than crystalline solids."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Great deal for Happy Hour ! Discounted prices for appetizers and meats. Its like 3 for an order of pork belly or beef toro (brisket). Came here for \\"dinner\\" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro. Service by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny. We had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi. The pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - 5.95 - As the \\"toro\\" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and \\"crispy\\". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along 10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x Prime kalbi - 8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the \\"prime\\" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places. Toro Beef - 3.45 - otherwise quoted as \\"Beef Brisket\\". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that. Pork belly - 2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts. Overall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area. They have a lot of appetizers discounted during Happy Hour as well. Didn't try any though. Choose from: 1. negative; 2. positive;","completion":"3. mixed This review has a mixed sentiment.

Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...

Summarize the following: Many misconceptions about homeschooling come from a lack of information or knowledge about what homeschooling entails. While you are most likely familiar with the benefits of homeschooling, it is often useful to have a wide pool of facts to draw upon when you confront misconceptions. Education research can provide you with facts and statistics that can help you to better explain your decision. The National Home Education Research Institute, HSLDA, and the Coalition for Responsible Home Education are all great sources for research on homeschooling. Many people worry that homeschooled children do not have the same opportunities to socialize as traditionally schooled children. People may ask, \\"What do your children do to make friends?\\" You can share the ways that you've involved them in groups and you can say that, \\"Our children see their friends as frequently as they would if they were in a public school.\\" There are many ways that children have the opportunity to spend time with other children. You can enroll your child in an organized sports league, join homeschooling groups that take field trips, participate in religious organizations, and being active in your community. Homeschooling does not mean that you want to deprive your child of socialization opportunities, but it can protect them from some of the more negative social aspects of the public school system, like bullying. If someone is curious about your decision to homeschool, feel free to share your reasons for coming to the decision to begin homeschooling with them. Don’t feel obligated to share reasons if they are personal. Of course, the reasons that factored into your decision to homeschool may be intimate and private.

Hotshot businessman Bill Campbell has returned to his hometown of Buzzsaw at the request of his younger sister Marci, who is convinced that their stepfather Mayor Van Der Haven has been murdered and replaced by his twin brother Matt Skearns. On the way to Buzzsaw, Bill's car and clothes (including his wallet which contains an important contact number) are stolen by a woman named Sally and he is forced to hitchhike home naked, where he is picked up by two drunken brothers—both named Jim (Monks and Reilly). Over the course of the day, Campbell must find Sally, retrieve his wallet, and avoid the diabolical Skearns, who is looking for financial compensation after spending 15 years in prison for a crime committed by his twin brother. The film ends with Skearns driving off a cliff and into a canyon, rather than risk capture by the police. Marci, who tells her classmates what happened, introduces them to her brother and his wife, Sally. Marci also tells her classmates that the Jim brothers were congratulated as heroes for trying to bring a criminal to justice.

What is the title of this article: Breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome with its convexity towards the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.","completion":"The title of this article could be \\"How Breathing Works in Mammals.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. and the situation: Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. Answer the following question: Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests? A:","completion":"Given the background information, it is likely that Greece experienced less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy. One of the main reasons behind this conclusion is the mention of different environmental issues faced by each country. Italy is specifically mentioned to have problems with air pollution, which is a major contributor to acid rain. The sulfur oxides released from coal-fired power plants and nitrogen oxides caused by motor vehicle exhaust are two primary sources of acid rain, and both are prevalent in a highly polluted environment. On the other hand, Greece is facing issues with drought, which implies that the country may be experiencing less precipitation overall. In this case, less precipitation typically correlates with less acid rain. Furthermore, the specific problem of drought faced by Greece suggests that the country may not have substantial air pollution, or at least not at the same level as Italy. While it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without actual data, given the background information provided, it is more likely that Greece experiences less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy. This is primarily due to Italy's high levels of air pollution which contribute to the formation of acid rain, and Greece's issues with drought, which indicate less precipitation overall."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Can you tell me the answer to who wrote the original snow white and the seven dwarfs??","completion":"\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is a German fairy tale that was first published by the Brothers Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm, in 1812 as part of their collection called \\"Kinder- und Hausmärchen,\\" or \\"Children's and Household Tales\\" (more well-known today as \\"Grimm's Fairy Tales\\"). The story is known in German as \\"Schneewittchen,\\" and it is one of the most famous and enduring European fairy tales. However, it's important to note that the Brothers Grimm did not create the story themselves; instead, they collected and recorded folktales from various sources, including oral traditions and earlier written works, and edited them to create the versions we know today. The origins of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can be traced back to ancient European myths and legends, and similar stories can be found in various cultures. One possible early influence for the story comes from the ancient Roman myth of Chione, who was so beautiful that she claimed to be more beautiful than Diana, the goddess of the hunt. In response, Diana hunted down Chione and killed her with an arrow. Furthermore, various versions of a story featuring a wicked stepmother, a jealous queen, and a beautiful young girl can be found throughout European folklore. Some scholars also point to the German countess Margarete von Waldeck as a possible historical figure behind the story of Snow White. Born in 1533, Margarete was known for her beauty and grew up in a mining town where child labor was common, which might have inspired the seven dwarfs. Furthermore, the stepmother aspect of the story might have come from Margarete's own life, as she had a difficult relationship with her father's second wife. She later moved to the Spanish royal court, and some rumors suggest that she was poisoned there. While the origins of the tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can be traced back to various sources, the version popularized by the Brothers Grimm remains the most widely recognized and has been adapted into numerous forms over the years, including the classic 1937 animated film by Walt Disney."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. I am facing a new situation today: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Ann has candied the ginger, plums, and pears, while she did not candy the apples, oranges, apricots, and bananas. As the question asks about the crystallized sugar content in plums and apricots, it is important to note that only plums were candied in this situation, while apricots were not. Therefore, the plums will have more crystallized sugar content because they have undergone the sugaring process. In contrast, the apricots have not been subject to sugaring and do not contain additional crystallized sugar apart from their natural sugar content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a... Question: Where was the marble portrait first displayed?

At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armour is damaged. He goads Kate, a female blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the sword event at the tournament. In the joust, he faces a Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust of the tournament, Adhemar defeats William. Kate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour allowing him greater mobility. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Edward, the Black Prince.

When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block.

The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento.

It's a nostalgic love letter to New York of the late '30s, a novel of manners with lofty aspirations that evokes some of the classics of American literature. The story unfolds largely in flashback, set on New Year's Eve in Manhattan 1937. The Jazz Age is over, the Depression in its final days, World War II just over the horizon. At its outset, there is a budding love triangle between Katey Kontent, that's \\"kon-tent, like the state of being\\"; her boardinghouse roommate, Eve; and a handsome banker, Theodore \\"Tinker\\" Grey, but an unexpected accident sends the story in a more serious direction.

She's a young woman of \\"poise and purpose.\\" Brooklyn-born, the daughter of immigrant laborers, she works in a Wall Street secretarial pool though aspires to much more. Alongside a supporting cast with WASPy nicknames like Dicky, Bitsy and Peaches, Katey navigates her way through Manhattan jazz clubs and Long Island cocktail parties and into the upper echelons of New York society. The novel takes its title from young George Washington's \\"Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation\\"; you'll find all 110 of them in the novel's appendix.

I figured that it's about time I let this one out. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now, I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And, after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters, I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says \`Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap. *possible spoilers from here on* Well, I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. Then, there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was \`Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music, fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. Oh, and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But, I haven't touched on the worst of it yet. You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were \`well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' That in mind, I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, \`You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words \`the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point, I became a bit more uneasy. \`The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However, I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake. Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB. However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read \`the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So, Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time, he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category, Ash wasn't really the \`one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way. A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection \`started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse, Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. \`Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well, that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\".

He's smooth, charming, and has never been caught in his professional 'career.' Living a life of luxury, deception, and shady deals, he never planned on making friends or taking an apprentice. One sunny afternoon, Roy crosses paths with Angela, a young, ambitious, and smart woman who has also recently entered the world of cons and scams. However, Angela's wild curiosity puts her on Roy's radar as she bites off more than she can chew by dipping into one of his major cons. Initially, they form a turbulent relationship – Roy is driven by the fear that Angela's mistake might implicate him, while Angela is desperate to prove herself to someone she admires. Roy reluctantly agrees to teach Angela the art of conning, but only under the condition that her involvement in his schemes would remain a secret. As the story unfolds, he teaches her the ropes – the subtle techniques of persuasion, strategies of deception, misdirection, and how to blend in with various crowds. While their partnership grows, so does their unspoken emotional bond as Roy sees himself in young Angela, remembering his own struggles when he was an inexperienced con artist. Their cons escalate, becoming more elaborate and daring. All the while, an honest and relentless detective named Gary Thompson is hot on their trail growing increasingly obsessed with catching Roy, fueled by the challenge Roy's never-ending game of cat and mouse presents. As the story reaches its climax, Angela proposes an ambitious con, targeting the influential and corrupt businessman Maximilian Devereux for a once-in-a-lifetime big score. Despite Roy's reluctance, they both commit to the plan; however, this time, Roy realizes that Detective Thompson is closing in on them. Facing a hard decision, Roy sacrifices his own safety for Angela, who's like family now. Detective Thompson finally arrests Roy, and it appears that their con has failed. But in a thrilling twist, Angela reveals that she has outsmarted Thompson and pulled off the con without detection. Now realizing that Roy has been the master behind their successful cons, Angela decides to honor Roy's teaching by giving her share of the spoils to help those she'd conned. Through Roy's tutelage, Angela not only learns the art of conning but also the importance of empathy and integrity, turning her life around to use her skills for a greater purpose. As the movie ends, Roy, although behind bars, admires Angela's personal growth and takes solace in the difference he made on their journey together. Meanwhile, Angela commits herself to using her newly acquired skills to help the greater good, always remembering the invaluable lessons Roy reluctantly taught her."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

After a difficult search, the couple discovered who their daughter's biological dad was, that part of the story is even more jaw dropping. The family who we will call Paula, Jeff and Ashley thought it would be fun to do DNA testing, but when Paula got the results she was shocked, \\" I felt my stomach just drop,\\" says Paula, who, when she opened the results on her computer found that her husband did not have any DNA matches with the couple's daughter, \\"when I called my daughter and my husband's DNA up next to one another they didn't share any DNA at all, and I just thought to myself, 'oh my god,'\\" says Paula, \\"I was shaking,\\" she says as she told her husband the terrible news. \\"I said Jeff, you're not going to believe this it's showing that you and Ashley are not related.\\" The couple began thinking the same thing. Back in the early 90's the pair was having trouble conceiving, so they went to Reproductive Medical Technologies, a clinic in Midvale that is associated with the University of Utah. In 1992 Ashley, now 21, was born, but with the recent revelations. The couple began to ask how this could happen. They feared that perhaps there was a mix up at the clinic. Paula, using the genealogy she had acquired, tracked down a cousin of Ashley's biological father, who told her that, Thomas R. Lippert, her cousin, had worked at the very clinic where Paula had been inseminated. \\"I remember that he was at the front desk a lot of the time,\\" recalls Paula who says the couple tried on several occasions to get pregnant, She says Lippert who was a part-time employee of the university from 1988 to 1994, had a stack of baby pictures behind his desk, \\"he seemed friendly and was very proud of all those pictures almost seemed like a brag board up there, those where the children that he had helped people have.\\" says Paula. Lippert's mother agreed to give a DNA sample and the result confirmed that Lippert was indeed Ashley's father. The question now is how all of this happened, Paula suspects that Lippert for some reason may have switched his sperm sample with her husband's. \\"I just thought, 'oh my gosh,' this was not an accident, this was intentional. All those photos of the babies that he was so proud of I thought, 'oh my god how many of those are his biological children?'\\" says Paula. This story only gets more stunningly bizarre, as the couple began digging into Lippert's background. They discovered, that prior to coming to work for the clinic, Lippert had served two years in prison for a high profile kidnapping, where he is accused of snatching up a college co-ed and holding her for three weeks and conducting \\"love experiments\\", that included locking her in a black box and using electroshock therapy on her to make her \\"fall in love with him.\\" The University of Utah is responding to the story and offered 2News the following statement; here it is in its entirety: \\"Since April 2013, the University of Utah has been investigating credible information regarding the possible mislabeling or tampering of a semen sample at RMTI (Reproductive Medical Technologies, Inc.), a private andrology lab owned by a University faculty member (now deceased). The facility was a private laboratory located in Midvale, Utah. While not owned or operated by the University, the University contracted with RMTI for specimen preparation and semen analysis. Additionally, RMTI prepared semen samples for private physician offices throughout the community, not University physicians. Through genetic testing, a woman who received artificial insemination (AI) in 1991 discovered the biological father of her child was not her husband, as she had assumed. She traced the genetics of her child to a man who was a former employee of the now-defunct RMTI, which may have prepared the AI sample. The man in question was also a part-time employee of the University from 1988-94. There are no remaining records from RMTI to prove the claim and the man in question has been deceased since 1997. Consequently, it is unknown how this incident might have happened. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate this situation extends beyond the case in question. We understand this information has been upsetting for the family and other clients of RMTI. We want to help alleviate this distress by providing professional genetic testing for RMTI clients who were treated between 1988 through 1994. Concerned individuals should contact the University of Utah Andrology Lab at 801-587-5852.\\" For more information on this case and genetic genealogy, click here::http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2014/01/artificial-insemination.html http://lippertschildren.blogspot.com/ By Chris Jones (Copyright 2014 Sinclair Broadcasting Group) Family Discovers Insemination Switch after Tracing Genealogy ||||| Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016.

The University of Utah is offering free genetic testing to families who went to the Midvale, Utah, clinic during the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of these jaw-dropping revelations. Now, the family has set up a website for others who believe they might have been victims of a semen-switching plan by the receptionist. The family discovered the truth about their daughter's parentage thanks to a direct-to-consumer genetic test by 23andMe, according to CeCe Moore, an independent genetic genealogist who first broke the story on her blog. Moore was contacted by \\"Paula,\\" a pseudonym for the mother in the case, in October 2012. Paula and her husband \\"Jeff\\" had used the private clinic Reproductive Medical Technologies, Inc. (RMTI) in Midvale to conceive their daughter \\"Ashley\\" in 1992. Paula and Jeff had not requested donor sperm, and had no reason to believe that Jeff's semen had not been used for the insemination. But after all three family members had their DNA tested through 23andMe, Paula discovered something shocking: Her daughter and her husband did not share any DNA markers. DNA shock Traditional paternity tests confirmed 23andMe's information — no surprise, Moore told LiveScience, as the typical paternity test compares up to 21 genetic markers, while 23andMe's test look at one million. [7 Diseases You Can Learn About from a Genetic Test] \\"Although it's not legally admissible, it's a much more thorough test,\\" she said. Moore is not employed by 23andMe, though she is a volunteer with the company's Ancestry Ambassadors group, which provides the company feedback on its products. She has also volunteered her expertise on projects for the genetic testing firm Family Tree DNA. Reeling, the family wondered if the clinic had made a mistake. The truth turned out to be far more distressing. On Moore's advice, Paula had Ashley tested by two other consumer genetic testing firms, Family Tree DNA and AncestryDNA. With Ashley's DNA profile in those two companies' databases, a match popped up — a first cousin, once removed. Fortunately, that cousin had information that linked her and Ashley. From about 1986 to 1995, her cousin Thomas Lippert had manned the front desk at RMTI. Lippert is no longer living, but his 99-year-old mother agreed to have her DNA tested. The results confirmed that she is Ashley's grandmother. Lippert, her only child, must have been Ashley's father. Disturbing history The family did not get back to LiveScience in time to comment for this article; Moore said they are \\"overwhelmed\\" with media attention in the wake of her blog post. However, she said the news brought them a huge sense of betrayal. \\"For the mother, it's like being defiled,\\" she said. \\"It's disgusting — somebody tricking you into having their own sperm implanted in your body.\\" For Ashley's father, \\"it's like a theft,\\" Moore said. And Ashley \\"has to grapple with the fact that this man is part of her biology.\\" Coming to terms with her biological parentage may be even more difficult given another revelation about Lippert: In 1975, he pled guilty to two counts of conspiring to kidnap after the abduction of a Purdue University student who said Lippert and another man stripped her, forced her into a large black box and threatened her with electric shocks in an effort to brainwash her into loving Lippert. Lippert was sentenced to six years in prison, according to a 2007 article in the alumni magazine of Southwest Minnesota State University, where Lippert was a business professor at the time of the arrest. He apparently served only two of those six years. The revelations about Lippert have Ashley's family concerned that he fathered other children. If Ashley has biological half-siblings, she would like to be in touch with them, Moore said. The family has set up a website for others who are worried that they were also victims of Lippert. Ashley \\"has handled this unbelievably well,\\" Moore said. The search for other victims In the wake of Ashley's family going public, the University of Utah issued a statement confirming that it has been investigating \\"credible information regarding the possible mislabeling or tampering of a semen sample at RMTI\\" since April 2013. The facility was private, but contracted with the university to prepare and analyze semen samples. [5 Myths About Fertility Treatments] RMTI is no longer operating, and the university says that there are no records remaining to explain how Lippert ended up fathering Ashley. Individuals wishing to avail themselves of paternity testing can contact the University of Utah Andrology Lab at (801) 587-5852. Paternity tests are not the only option available to worried families, Moore said. Because Ashley, Ashley's biological grandmother and Lippert's cousin all have their DNA on record in the databases of 23andMe, Family Tree DNA and AncestryDNA, tests by any of those companies would immediately reveal a relationship to Lippert. A university paternity test can only show that the child is not related to his or her father, necessitating a second round of testing if there is no genetic relationship, Moore said. \\"I'm not saying they shouldn't test through the university, but I think some people might prefer independent private testing,\\" she said. Though the case brought appalling news to Ashley, Paula and Jeff, Moore said the DNA testing reveals the power of consumer genetics. Lippert's case is not the only example of malfeasance at sperm banks or clinics. In 1992, for example, fertility doctor Cecil Jacobson was convicted on charges of fraud and perjury for scams at his clinic in Virginia in the 1980s. DNA tests showed that Jacobson had fathered at least 15 children with patients told they were getting anonymous donor sperm. With companies like 23andMe on the scene, the DNA evidence proving such cases is no longer in the shadows. \\"My message to anyone who would think of doing something like this is you will not get away with it,\\" Moore said.

Question: Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Why can humans keep stable body temperatures in different seasons? A) Because their bodies are unusually efficient. B) Because they experience different climates. C) Because they can adjust to cultural patterns and technologies. D) Because they have internal temperature regulating systems. Answer:","completion":"Humans can maintain stable body temperatures in different seasons primarily because of their remarkably efficient internal temperature regulating systems. These systems work automatically to keep the core body temperature constant in diverse climatic conditions, such as cold winters and warm summers. The human body has several mechanisms for temperature regulation, including sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin. For instance, when body temperatures rise due to warm environments or physical activity, the body starts to sweat. The evaporation of sweat cools the skin and lowers the body's core temperature. Conversely, in cold conditions, the body conserves heat by constricting blood vessels near the skin and shivering to generate warmth through muscle activity. In addition to these physiological adaptations, humans have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them further adjust to various temperature extremes. For instance, they have invented clothing, shelter, and heating and cooling systems to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures. In cold climates, people wear insulating clothing layers to trap warmth and protect their bodies from cold, wind, and moisture. In hot climates, they often wear looser, breathable fabrics to facilitate heat loss and air circulation. Furthermore, people have developed specific food habits, social customs, and work routines that often reflect their adaptation to their environment's thermal characteristics. For example, in hot climates, cultures may adopt siestas, a midday nap or rest, as a means of avoiding the most intense heat. In contrast, in colder climates, people typically engage in more indoor activities and consume high-energy foods to keep their body temperatures stable. However, when extreme temperatures exceed the body's natural ability to regulate its core temperature, there is a risk of developing hypothermia (lowered body temperature) or hyperthermia (increased body temperature) which can be life threatening. In these situations, the body's natural temperature regulating mechanisms are unable to cope with the environmental challenges, and humans must rely on other means to maintain safety and health. To sum up, humans can keep stable body temperatures in different seasons due to their highly efficient internal temperature regulating systems, as well as their ability to adapt to various climates through cultural patterns and technologies. Combined, these factors allow humans to thrive in a wide range of temperature and humidity extremes prevalent across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: I was in Houston a few weeks ago,and needed to be back home in Austin by midmorning the next day.Though I usually left in the evening,for some reason last time I had to choose to set off after midnight. I was on my way back to Austin when I realized I left an important file,and knew I had to return to get it.I took the first exit I could,but when I rounded the corner,an 18-wheeler was stopped dead in the exit lane.I swerved to avoid it,and then I realized that there was something wrong with my car.So I pulled into a small parking lot and unsurprisingly found the area deserted at 3:15am.I've lived in urban areas most of my life.I'm fairly street-wise and don't become frightened easily,but I knew I was in a pretty tough neighborhood. There was no one in Houston to pick me up.I immediately locked the doors and picked up my phone to call a tow truck.Soon a young man knocked on my driver's side window and asked if he could help me.Judging from his appearance,he was far from a mad man,but I knew he was far more likely to rob than help me.So I lied to him.After a while,he asked again,but this time I politely refused and told him the tow truck was due any minute.He finally said,\\"Madam,you need help.A tow truck in Houston will arrive anywhere between 45minutes and approximately never (which I knew was true),and you aren't going anywhere until you change your flat tire.\\" After considering thoroughly,I got out.He looked surprised,but got right to work.He changed the tire,returned the seat to its place and said,\\"Thank you for letting me help you.You gave me a chance when most people would never open the door to someone like me.Would it be okay if I gave you a hug?\\"When I recovered,I gave him a giant hug.I left with a new tire and a renewed faith in human nature. Question: Why did the author lie to the man and refuse his help in the beginning? - Because she thought the man was playing jokes. - Because she thought the man might be a bad man. - Because she thought the man wanted to get a lift. - Because she thought the man was a mad man.

Here is an article: February 5, 2014, 2:17 pm LOS ANGELES — Elton John on Wednesday said that his movie production company had acquired the film rights to “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” and planned to make a feature-length animated musical. First performed on Broadway in 1982, “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, is still touring in corners of the globe and has become a staple of school productions. Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice will serve as executive producers of the film adaptation, which is still in the early stages; no potential release date was announced. Mr. John’s production company, Rocket Pictures, was behind the hit animated film “Gnomeo & Juliet,” which took in 193 million worldwide in 2011 and was distributed in the United States by the Walt Disney Company. A sequel, “Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes” is being developed. Rocket Pictures is currently shooting a biopic of its founder. “Rocketman,” which will be released by Focus Features, although a date has not been set, stars Tom Hardy as the singer. Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice are experienced with film adaptations of their musicals. “Evita,” starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas, took in 209 million worldwide in 1996, after accounting for inflation. A major film version of the Bible-themed “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” has been bandied about for years — particularly after a hit 1993 revival on Broadway starring Donny Osmond — but took on new life last year after the film success of “Les Miserables.” Write a title for it.","completion":"Elton John's Production Company Acquires Film Rights to \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\" for Animated Musical Adaptation"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Public Enemy is an American hip hop group consisting of Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Professor Griff, Khari Wynn, DJ Lord, and the S1W group. Founding member DJ Terminator X left the group in 1999. Formed on Long Island, New York, in 1986, they are known for their politically charged music and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the African American community. Their first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either gold or platinum and were, according to music critic Robert Hilburn in 1998, \\"the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act\\". Carlton Ridenhour (Chuck D) and William Drayton (Flavor Flav) met at Long Island's Adelphi University in the mid-1980s. Developing his talents as an MC with Flav while delivering furniture for his father's business, Chuck D and Spectrum City, as the group was called, released the record \\"Check Out the Radio\\", backed by \\"Lies\\", a social commentary--both of which would influence RUSH Productions' Run-D.M.C. and Beastie Boys. Chuck D put out a tape to promote WBAU (the radio station where he was working at the time) and to fend off a local MC who wanted to battle him. He called the tape Public Enemy #1 because he felt like he was being persecuted by people in the local scene. This was the first reference to the notion of a public enemy in any of Chuck D's songs. The single was created by Chuck D with a contribution by Flavor Flav, though this was before the group Public Enemy was officially assembled. Around 1986, Bill Stephney, the former Program Director at WBAU, was approached by Ali Hafezi and offered a position with the label. Stephney accepted, and his first assignment was to help fledgling producer Rick Rubin sign Chuck D, whose song \\"Public Enemy Number One\\" Rubin had heard from Andre \\"Doctor Dre\\" Brown. According to the book The History of Rap Music by Cookie Lommel, \\"Stephney thought it was time to mesh the hard-hitting style of Run DMC with politics that addressed black youth. Chuck recruited Spectrum City, which included Hank Shocklee, his brother Keith Shocklee, and Eric \\"Vietnam\\" Sadler, collectively known as the Bomb Squad, to be his production team and added another Spectrum City partner, Professor Griff, to become the group's Minister of Information. With the addition of Flavor Flav and another local mobile DJ named Terminator X, the group Public Enemy was born.\\" According to Chuck, The S1W, which stands for Security of the First World, \\"represents that the black man can be just as intelligent as he is strong. It stands for the fact that we're not third-world people, we're first-world people; we're the original people.\\" Hank Shocklee came up with the name Public Enemy based on \\"underdog love and their developing politics\\" and the idea from Def Jam staffer Bill Stephney following the Howard Beach racial incident, Bernhard Goetz, and the death of Michael Stewart: \\"The Black man is definitely the public enemy.\\" Public Enemy started out as opening act for the Beastie Boys during the latter's Licensed to Ill popularity, and in 1987 released their debut album Yo! Bum Rush the Show.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Where was the local scene?","completion":"The local scene mentioned in the text was in Long Island, New York, where Public Enemy was formed in 1986."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; Mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers do work to repel mosquitoes, and they are a popular and effective method for controlling mosquitoes in an environment. The vaporizers operate by dispersing a chemical compound called Pyrethroids or Allethrin into the air. These compounds are known as synthetic versions of pyrethrum, a natural insecticide found in chrysanthemum flowers. The chemical works by affecting the mosquito's nervous system, making it less likely to bite and repel it instead. There are several types of mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers available in the market, such as plug-in devices, refillable liquid containers, and all-in-one units. These devices work by using an electrical heating system to heat up the liquid, turning it into vapor. Once heated, the volatile chemical is released into the air, creating a protective barrier that repels mosquitoes within a certain area. However, the effectiveness of mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers may vary due to several factors, such as: 1. Room size: The repellent's effectiveness typically works in an enclosed environment where the concentration of the vapor can be maintained. If the room is too large or has inadequate ventilation, the vapor's concentration may not be strong enough to repel mosquitoes effectively. 2. Type of mosquito: The effectiveness of liquid vaporizers may vary depending on the mosquito species. Some species might be more resistant or less attracted to the chemical compounds used in the repellent. 3. Proper usage: The vaporizer should be placed in an appropriate location and turned on before mosquitoes become active (usually during dusk hours). Ensure that windows and doors are closed, so the vaporized chemical creates a protective barrier. Also, replacing the liquid refill regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions will help maintain optimal performance. 4. Individual factors: Some person's natural body chemistry may make them more attractive to mosquitoes, even when using a repellent vaporizer. In such cases, it might be necessary to combine the vaporizer with other repellent methods such as sprays or creams on the skin. In conclusion, the questions \\"Does mosquito repellent liquid vaporizer actually work?\\" and \\"How do mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers work?\\" have the same meaning, as they both inquire about the functionality and effectiveness of mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers. Mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers can effectively repel mosquitoes when used correctly, although several factors like room size, type of mosquito, proper usage, and individual preferences may impact their efficiency. Nonetheless, they are a widely accepted and popular method to manage and prevent mosquito bites indoors."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. and a hint : Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. Please answer this question : Would Archimedes' device more likely or less likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one. This is because Archimedes was known for his great inventions of machines that could effectively change the manner in which work was done, either by increasing the force applied, increasing the distance over which the force was applied, or changing the direction in which the force was applied. Since Ptolemy was unable to develop a machine in the given time, his device would likely not have these benefits, making Archimedes' device more effective at making work easier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are likely part of a larger group, since the requester mentioned \\"a large group of people.\\" Given the wardrobe change and the presence of an audience, this event might be a sports competition, a theatrical performance, or another form of entertainment. When the two men turn to face the camera to speak, they could be preparing to deliver a message to viewers, perhaps introducing themselves and the event that is about to unfold. They may describe the purpose of the event, who they are, and what roles they play within the larger group. The camera might be for a live broadcast or be recording to disseminate the footage later, so the men could also address anyone watching remotely or discuss the significance of the event being recorded. In the context of a sports competition, the two men could be athletes part of a larger team, and the spandex attire suggests they may be participating in sports like gymnastics, swimming, or cycling. They might explain the rules or objectives of the competition, share their thoughts on their opponents or the event's significance, and possibly express gratitude to their supporters, teammates, and coaches. If the event is a theatrical performance, the spandex clothing and robes may be costumes the two men will wear during the show. In this case, the men might introduce themselves as actors or performers, provide background information on the play or production they are involved in, and possibly mention highlights for audience members to look forward to. They could also thank the crew, fellow performers, and audience for their support and enthusiasm. Alternatively, the event could involve a dance or acrobatic performance, with the two men being part of a larger troupe. When they speak to the camera, they may introduce themselves, explain the theme or concept behind the performance, and describe their training process or creative inspiration. They could also discuss the challenges they have faced and the support they have received from fans, coaches, and fellow performers. In any case, the presence of a large group of people implies that this event has attracted significant interest, and the audience may be eager to watch the two men and their group perform. It's possible that they are also dressed in spandex or similarly striking attire, ready to join the main pair in their activity. As the event unfolds, the audience might react with excitement, applause, or anticipation, conveying the significance of the event or performance to those in attendance and viewers watching through the camera."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carrie is the sick person.; (II). Lindsey is the sick person.;","completion":"The cough of Carrie is very bad, so Lindsey recommends Nyquil. This statement clearly indicates that Carrie is the sick person and Lindsey is trying to help her by recommending a remedy for her cough. Hence, the correct option to pick from the given choices is (I). Carrie is the sick person. In this scenario, Carrie seems to be suffering from a bad cough, which may be a symptom of a cold, flu, or other respiratory illness. These conditions can be quite uncomfortable and disruptive, making it essential for Carrie to find relief as soon as possible. Lindsey, as a compassionate and caring friend, steps in to suggest the use of an over-the-counter medication, Nyquil. Nyquil is a popular remedy for cold and flu symptoms, making it a suitable recommendation in this instance. It contains various active ingredients, such as acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine succinate, which work together to help reduce symptoms such as fever, cough, and runny nose. By recommending Nyquil, Lindsey is expressing concern for Carrie's health and well-being, as she hopes that it will effectively alleviate her friend's cough and associated discomfort. This shows that Lindsey is empathetic and supportive, traits that are essential in helping someone who is not feeling well. In contrast, (II) Lindsey is the sick person is not the correct option in this case, as the sentence explicitly states that Carrie is the one suffering from the bad cough. Were Lindsey to be the sick person, the sentence would need to be rewritten to indicate her situation accurately. However, no such alteration is required as the original sentence is coherent and properly reflects the roles of both characters. In conclusion, the sentence adequately describes the situation where Carrie is the sick person dealing with a bad cough, and Lindsey is a concerned friend attempting to help her by recommending Nyquil as a potential remedy.

Rand Paul, one of the most vocal GOP opponents of voting on a repeal bill before coming up with a replacement package, voted against the budget resolution and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein was absent. Senators were bleary-eyed as they walked quickly to the exits, wrapping up the final vote a little before 1:30 a.m. ET. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat who led the late-night fight against a repeal, said the protest could be a sign of things to come as the fight stretches on. \\"I think it's important for this country to know this was not a usual thing, this is a day which lays the groundwork for 30 million people to be thrown off their health insurance,\\" Sanders said. \\"And if that happens, many of these people will die.\\" JUST WATCHED How Sanders plans to deal with Obamacare Replay More Videos ...

Chuck Schumer. Democratic senators registered a somewhat subtle, but significant protest in the Senate as they cast their votes -- declaring why they were voting against the repeal, a rare move that rankled Republicans in the chamber. The House is expected take a swift vote on the resolution, possibly as early as Friday, which will trigger congressional committees to begin crafting a second bill that would roll back major parts of Obamacare. Though it will be weeks before Congress votes on that bill, Thursday still marked a victory for the Republican Party as it moves toward overhauling the country's healthcare system. President-elect Donald Trump congratulated the Senate for its actions Thursday. \\"Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!\\" he tweeted. Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 \\"Vote-a-rama\\" Before Thursday's vote, a political spectacle known as \\"vote-a-rama\\" unfolded on the Senate floor. The largely symbolic exercise -- which began Wednesday evening and stretched into wee hours of Thursday -- was ripe for theater. However, the tone was largely subdued, missing some of the fire of voting marathons in previous years. Democrats still used the late-night drill to publicly defend the Affordable Care Act and chastise their colleagues across the aisle for starting the process of overhauling a law that gives health insurance to some 20 million Americans. Republicans, meanwhile, stressed the harmful impact of the law and the urgent need to do away with it. Senators introduced more than 160 amendments to the budget resolution, which led to a marathon session of impassioned speeches and roll call votes. Although these votes were non-binding and the budget resolution doesn't require the president's signature, the process helped crystallize the Democratic Party's top priorities as it looks to defend the major pillars of Obamacare. JUST WATCHED Years of President Obama defending Obamacare Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Years of President Obama defending Obamacare 02:00 The most important amendments for Democrats were aimed at preserving what they argue are popular provisions of Obamacare. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin pressed a measure to allow young adults to stay on their parents insurance until age 26. \\"It will block Republican efforts that would weaken dependent coverage,\\" Baldwin said in a brief but forceful floor speech before the vote. But Republicans -- many of whom have expressed interest in maintaining the provision when they eventually replace Obamacare -- nevertheless blocked the Baldwin amendment, arguing it wasn't applicable to the underlying budget resolution. Democrats also sought to protect measures dealing with pre-existing conditions and reproductive healthcare services for women. Divided but some common ground At times, the evening also showed that Republicans and Democrats share some common goals -- even if the two political parties are bitterly divided on the merits of Obamacare. Earlier in the night, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who has called on Republicans to work in a bipartisan fashion on repealing and replacing Obamacare, emphasized the importance of preserving coverage for patients in rural areas. No matter what happens to Obamacare, Manchin said: \\"We are going to make sure that we protect our rural hospitals and rural clinics.\\" But on the same topic, Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that it was because of Obamacare that rural hospitals have shuttered. \\"For people in small towns -- the closures that we've already experienced, these closures have had a devastating impact,\\" Barrasso said. Trump has ratcheted up the pressure this week, calling on his party to act as quickly as possible. Perhaps more significantly, Trump is adamant that Republicans vote on repealing and replacing Obamacare more or less at the same time. This is a significant divergence from the party's initial thinking that it would first vote on repeal before considering replacement options. Trump's plan In a news conference in Wednesday, Trump told reporters that a plan will be unveiled soon after his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, is confirmed. A Georgia congressman, Price is an ardent Obamacare critic and has previously introduced detailed legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Even as Republicans advanced the plan to roll back Obamacare, plans to replace were still being formulated. To that end, a small group of relatively moderate Republican senators -- including Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski -- initially pushed a change that would give senators until March to develop a plan to replace Obamacare. But the senators dropped that push as it became clear Wednesday that Republican leaders were moving toward replacing Obamacare as they repeal it. Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with senators at the Capitol Wednesday. As he exited his meeting with Pence, Manchin said that the incoming VP promised a draft replacement for Obamacare would be available in 30-60 days. Republicans on the Hill do not yet have a plan for replacing Obamacare, and are considering a series of possible legislative paths to replace what they vote to repeal. It's also not clear that one comprehensive \\"replacement\\" bill will ultimately emerge from GOP lawmakers -- in fact, senior leaders are currently weighing the option of incremental replacement bills. For example, they are exploring whether replacement measures could be inserted into the \\"repeal\\" reconciliation bill, which Republicans hope to vote on by late February or March. Leaders are also looking into whether any replacement or healthcare reform measures could be inserted into reauthorization bills that Congress is expected to take up later this year. ||||| On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would offer his own plan to repeal and replace the law “essentially simultaneously.” He said he would put forth the plan as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, is confirmed. The Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in the American health care system, and unwinding it will be a formidable challenge for Republicans. More than 20 million people have gained coverage under the law, though premiums have risen sharply in many states and some insurers have fled the law’s health exchanges. The budget blueprint instructs House and Senate committees to come up with repeal legislation by Jan. 27. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and four other Republicans had sought to extend that deadline by five weeks, to March 3. But late Wednesday night, Mr. Corker withdrew an amendment that would have changed the date. “We understand that everyone here understands the importance of doing it right,” he said. He described the Jan. 27 date in the budget blueprint as a placeholder. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, another Republican who sought to delay the deadline, said: “This date is not a date that is set in stone. In fact, it is the earliest we could do it. But it could take longer, and we believe that it might.” The House was planning to take up the budget blueprint once the Senate approved it, though some House Republicans have expressed discomfort with voting on the blueprint this week because of lingering questions over how and when the health care law would be replaced. ||||| Trump’s Obamacare impatience challenges GOP A quick repeal and replace of Obamacare on the scale the president-elect outlined is complex and arduous. Donald Trump on Wednesday called for a quick and nearly simultaneous repeal and replacement of Obamacare — a task that's technically almost impossible. Republicans can repeal much of the law on a party line vote under fast-track budget rules. But replacement require at least a handful of Senate Democrats to help dismantle President Barack Obama's historic achievement that's covering 20 million Americans. And the Republicans have to agree among themselves on a specific detailed bill, an agreement that has so far been elusive. Story Continued Below Republican leadership aides were quick to say after Trump's news conference that they're all on the same page, even though they had earlier planned for a swift vote on repeal (although delayed until sometime in the future) and then an extended debate over the replacement. But a quick repeal and replace of Obamacare on the scale the president-elect outlined is complex and arduous — and politically rife for accusations that Republicans are recklessly repealing a law with scant time for debate. On top of that, Trump indicated that his administration would introduce its own health care plan — which could either speed up the process of coalescing around a bill or drive a wedge between the Hill and the new White House. Trump didn't spell out what his plan would include. “We're going to be submitting as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,” Trump said in his first press conference since July. “It will be repeal and replace. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day. Could be the same hour.” His chosen HHS secretary, Rep. Tom Price, hasn't had his confirmation hearing yet. The Senate Finance Committee hasn't even scheduled it. Price testifies before the Senate HELP committee next Wednesday, but Finance is the one that votes on the nomination. The GOP currently has several different health bills and plans, and though they have some common features, lawmakers have not yet rallied around one. It's possible that Trump's proposal could be the impetus for the GOP to coalesce, said a lawmaker who didn’t want to be named. But it's not a guarantee. Price himself is the author of one of the more detailed proposals on the Hill. It's a conservative, market-oriented plan unlikely to win over Democrats. “Our new secretary of HHS has had a plan in his pocket now for the last three years,\\" said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who is acting as a liaison between Trump and the Hill. \\"If they did present an actual specific plan, that would be a much easier starting point than taking six plans or no plan and trying to start with that. … I think that would speed the process up incredibly.” “Everyone wants to say the Republicans don’t have a plan,” said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) “The problem is we have too many plans, and we’ve got to coalesce around one, and we’re going to.” Trump hasn't given details of his vision for a new health law, but he has stressed such ideas as allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. He didn't say — and wasn't asked — at the news conference how long it should take to transition from Obamacare to the new plan. Many Hill Republicans have called for a two- or three-year transition. If Republicans pursue the simultaneous repeal and replace plan, a repeal vote is unlikely to happen for at least several weeks — later than Republicans outlined as recently as a few weeks ago. The idea of a Trump health care plan took some Republican lawmakers by surprise. “I would welcome a plan from anybody,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “I would consider any plan.” John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, suggested that the Hill is talking with Trump officials on the idea. “There is already consultation with the incoming administration,” he said, calling for quick confirmation of Price “so we can interact officially. Right now, given the confirmation process, its more back channel.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is skeptical that even Trump can move legislation quite as fast as he wants. “He needs to call [Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell,” he said with a laugh when asked if Trump’s timeline is plausible. ||||| The Senate took a first step toward repealing ObamaCare and fulfilling a long-time campaign pledge in the early morning hours Thursday. Senators voted 51-48 to pass a budget resolution that is being used as a vehicle for rolling back the Affordable Care Act, with the House expected to vote on Friday. Meanwhile, Paul said in a statement after the vote that while he supports nixing ObamaCare, \\"putting nearly 10 trillion more in debt on the American people’s backs through a budget that never balances is not the way to get there.\\" \\"Up to 30 million Americans will lose their healthcare, with many thousands dying as a result,\\" he said. \\"Because when you have no health insurance and you can't go to a doctor or a hospital, you die.\\" Instead, Democrats rose one by one from their seats on the Senate floor in protest to state why they were voting against the resolution. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) voted against the budget resolution because it didn’t balance, while no Democrat supported the repeal rules. Republicans needed a simple majority of votes to clear the repeal rules, instructing committees to begin drafting repeal legislation, through the upper chamber, with the vote falling largely along party lines. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who had surgery to install a pacemaker, missed the \\"vote-a-rama\\" session that began Wednesday evening. Lawmakers were able to use the hourslong voting debate to force a vote on any amendment to the budget resolution. Some 180 amendments were filed. The late-night passage of the budget resolution comes despite deep divisions on when and how to replace ObamaCare, which were on full display. Lawmakers spent more than six hours on the Senate floor and voted on more than 19 amendments, none of which were successfully added to the resolution. But Republicans managed to avoid what was expected to be the top fight of the night, when a group of five GOP senators dropped their push to delay the ObamaCare repeal legislation. Lawmakers had wanted to push the deadline for committee repeal proposals from Jan. 27 to March, which they argued was needed to give lawmakers extra time to lock down details on a replacement bill and work with the incoming Trump administration about next steps. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), one of the Republicans backing the amendment, said the decision was a result of a \\"very thoughtful discussions\\" within Republicans and recognizing that the Jan. 27 date is a \\"placeholder.\\" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) added that \\"we have assurances from leadership that this date is not a date that is set in stone.\\" But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynSenate agrees to last-ditch talks, but no clear path over shutdown House-passed stopgap measure in Senate limbo The Hill's 12:30 Report — Latest as shutdown looms | Trump says Dems to blame | Senate GOP rejects calls to go 'nuclear' | Ginsburg undergoes lung surgery MORE (R-Texas) had warned that pushing back the date could create a \\"jam\\" on the Senate floor with GOP lawmakers wanting to tackle an ambitious agenda in President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpSchumer, Pelosi: Trump got 'what he wanted' with shutdown Trump has discussed firing Fed chief after latest interest rate hike: report LeBron James accuses NFL team owners of being 'old white men' with 'slave mentality' MORE's first 100 days. Republicans are also facing larger divisions among GOP members and the incoming Trump administration on when to replace ObamaCare. Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday that repeal and replace legislation would occur near simultaneously if not at the same time. “It'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour,” he said. But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — who was mocked by Trump during his press conference — told reporters that the president-elect “needs to call [Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell because that's not where we're headed.” McConnell (R-Ky.) has repeatedly sidestepped being tied down on the details of repealing and replacing ObamaCare and didn't take a position on the GOP amendment earlier this week. He said Wednesday that after Senate passage they can send the budget resolution \\"to the House and begin taking the next steps to finally move away from ObamaCare while we move ahead with smarter healthcare policies.\\" Most of Wednesday night’s action came from Democrats, who used the vote-a-rama to take votes on healthcare and entitlement programs, forcing Republicans to go on the record on a number of key issues. Democrats are warning that if Republicans break ObamaCare, they will own any political backlash and roil the insurance market. Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) appealed to Republicans earlier Wednesday, urging them to back down from the healthcare fight. \\"If Republicans go forward with this plan, they may mollify their base, but they will ostracize and hurt the American people, and ultimately lose in the court of public opinion,\\" he said. Democrats forced votes on a myriad of non-binding amendments aimed at blocking legislation that would \\"make America sick again,\\" a new Democratic slogan on the GOP plan to repeal ObamaCare without a replacement. One, from Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), would have made it harder to pass legislation that would “make young people sick again” and allow young adults to stay on their parents' healthcare coverage until they turn 26, one of the more popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Another, from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would have cracked down on legislation that would make \\"women sick again\\" by decreasing access to preventative healthcare, birth control and maternity care. But Republicans defeated each of the amendments. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) broke ranks from her party and supported Baldwin's amendment. The Senate also defeated a pair of competing amendments on importing prescription drugs. Sanders tried to use Trump to win over Republicans for his amendment to allow drugs to be imported from Canada. \\"Let's be clear about it today: Mr. Trump, a guy I don't quote very often, has said that pharma gets away with murder. That's what Trump said. He is right,\\" Sanders said ahead of the votes on the amendments. \\"The time has come for us to stand up to the drug companies.\\" But ultimately 13 Democrats voted against the Sanders proposal, while 12 Republicans voted for it. It wasn't all business as senators powered through the more than six-hour session. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also tweeted out observations from the Senate floor throughout the session, including comparing discussion between lawmakers as \\"ailment one upsmanship.\\" |||||","completion":"US Senate Republicans initiated the process of repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law early Thursday morning, approving the budget blueprint, dubbed the \\"repeal resolution\\".

In fact, the speaker explicitly states the opposite: \\"I don't believe we ought to have amnesty. I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.\\" Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The speaker starts by stating that they don't believe in granting amnesty. 2. They emphasize that they don't think illegal behavior should be rewarded. 3. They mention that there are people waiting in line to become citizens legally. 4. They argue against allowing those who have acted illegally to jump ahead of those who are following the legal process. From these steps, it is clear that the speaker is against rewarding illegal behavior and believes in prioritizing the legal process for citizenship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: Edwin Chadwick's 1829 article, \\"Preventive police\\" in the London Review, argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice. The reason, argued Chadwick, was that \\"A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation.\\" In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - \\"crime doesn't pay\\". In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act, the \\"object\\" of the new Metropolitan Police, was changed by Robert Peel to the \\"principal object,\\" which was the \\"prevention of crime.\\" Later historians would attribute the perception of England's \\"appearance of orderliness and love of public order\\" to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel's police system. When was 'Preventive Police' not published? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The question is asking for a time when \\"Preventive Police\\" was not published, which is an unusual request.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? , does not work . Options are: 1. negative; 2. positive;","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"does not work,\\" can be considered negative. Therefore, the correct option is: 1. Negative This conclusion stems from the fact that the phrase \\"does not work\\" implies that something is malfunctioning or not performing its intended function. This creates a sense of dissatisfaction or disappointment, which leans toward a negative connotation. In communication, the context in which a statement is made may play a key role in determining its exact sentiment. For instance, if someone encounters an issue in their work or daily life, the phrase \\"does not work\\" may very well serve to express frustration over that issue. On the other hand, if a person is trying to offer constructive criticism to help someone improve a product or service, saying \\"does not work\\" may represent a mere acknowledgement of a problem that needs fixing. However, given the standalone nature of the sentence provided, it is appropriate to label the sentiment as negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: In what year was forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments reportedly closed in Galveston? During the 1950s more dangerous criminal elements took advantage of Galveston's lax law enforcement and the absence of the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed. Though officials said they destroyed all of the city's gaming equipment, some locals including R.S. Maceo, nephew of Sam and Rose, claimed that most of the equipment was shipped to Las Vegas before authorities ever discovered it.

What is the name of the engagement on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942 in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated? Answer:","completion":"The engagement on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942 in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated is known as the Dieppe Raid, also referred to as Operation Jubilee. This military operation was an Allied attack during World War II, primarily involving forces from the United Kingdom and Canada, with additional support from the United States, Free France, and other Allied countries. The main objective of the Dieppe Raid was to assess the feasibility of a large-scale amphibious assault against the heavily fortified German-occupied territories in Europe and to gather crucial intelligence on German defenses. Furthermore, it aimed to boost the morale of the Allied forces by securing a swift victory on a critical European front. The HMS \\"Calpe\\" (L71), a British naval vessel, played a key role in this operation as one of the escort ships for the Allied forces during the raid. The ship, a Hunt-class destroyer escort, was responsible for safeguarding the landing crafts as they approached the shores of Dieppe and providing vital artillery support for the troops as they faced a fierce battle against the defending German forces. Unfortunately, the Dieppe Raid was considered a disastrous failure for the Allies, resulting in heavy casualties, the loss of many ships, and limited success in achieving its strategic goals. Of the nearly 6,000 Allied troops who participated in the operation, more than 3,600 were killed, wounded, or captured. The high casualty rate raised questions about the feasibility of future large-scale amphibious assaults, leading to significant changes in military tactics and the development of new equipment and strategies for the D-Day landings in 1944. In conclusion, the name of the engagement in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942 is the Dieppe Raid or Operation Jubilee, an ill-fated amphibious assault on German-occupied territory that would later shape future Allied military strategies in World War II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To check the capacity of the Ivorian Air Force, one would need to consider several factors, including the number and types of aircraft, personnel, and related resources available to the military branch. This assessment could be both quantitative and qualitative in nature. 1. Number and Types of Aircraft: Analyzing the Ivorian Air Force's capacity involves examining its fleet of aircraft for various missions, including combat, transport, and reconnaissance roles. This would require looking at fighter jets, transport planes, helicopters, and other aircraft types to understand the air force's capabilities and limitations. 2. Personnel: An evaluation of the air force's human resources is also an essential aspect of checking its capacity. This includes considering the training, skills, and experience of the pilots, maintenance crews, and support personnel. Understanding their level of expertise and efficiency can offer a clear indication of the overall effectiveness and readiness of the air force. 3. Budget and Resources: Assessing the financial resources and budget allocations for the Ivorian Air Force is also a crucial factor when checking its capacity. This would involve examining the defense budget, procurement plans, and other financial aspects to determine if the air force is well-funded, equipped, and maintained to carry out its mission effectively. 4. Infrastructure: A thorough evaluation of the Ivorian Air Force's capacity should also consider its infrastructure, including air bases, maintenance facilities, and communication systems. This includes ensuring that these facilities are well-maintained, secure, and strategically located to support efficient operations. 5. Joint Operations and Interoperability: Reviewing the Ivorian Air Force's ability to work with other branches of the military or partner nations during joint operations is essential for assessing its capacity. This involves examining the level of cooperation, communication, and interoperability that exists between the air force and other military forces to determine its operational effectiveness. 6. Technological Advancements: Assessing the technologies and equipment utilized by the Ivorian Air Force can help provide an accurate picture of its current capacity. This can include radar systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and modern communication tools that are essential for carrying out various air force missions effectively. Ultimately, checking the capacity of the Ivorian Air Force requires a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors that contribute to its overall effectiveness and readiness. By examining these various aspects, one can gain a clear insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the air force and identify areas for improvement, ensuring that the Ivorian Air Force remains a competent and capable force in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. It was the first time that she and a new contact had met in person. Ms Nuttall, a UK motivational speaker, says the man gave no explanation for turning up half an hour late at a London restaurant, and then proceeded to talk purely about himself. To add insult to injury, she says he then told her that she wasn't qualified to run her own business. And all this while he ordered the most expensive main course, and told Ms Nuttall that she'd have to foot the entire bill. \\"It was the worst,\\" says Ms Nuttall, 42. First things first, a business lunch isn't going out for a bite to eat with your mates from the office - that's socialising with colleagues. It is instead a business meeting, usually in a restaurant, and typically with someone from another organisation, or at least someone who doesn't work in your team. And the conversation will include business matters - be it talk about a sale, agreement or understanding that benefits both parties. You might think that going for a business lunch is a simple thing, but it is in fact beset with a whole menu of potential perils and pratfalls. From the choice of venue, to what food you pick, whether you order alcohol, and how you share the bill, any number of things can go wrong. Talking politics and religion is almost always a complete no-no, but what if an innocent chat about current affairs quickly turns to President Trump, Brexit or Scottish independence? We asked some etiquette experts and business coaches to guide us through the minefield. The first issue for someone organising a business lunch is the choice of restaurant. \\"You need to find somewhere with a careful balance of ambience,\\" says Jenny Flintoft, a leadership consultant based in the north of England. \\"I tend to favour a restaurant that is buzzy enough that conversations can be had without being overheard in a deathly quiet restaurant, but not one that has lots of background music, as the voice raising makes having a meaningful conversation very difficult.\\" Ms Flintoft also notes the importance of choosing the right dishes. \\"I personally steer clear of corn on the cob, as it can easily get stuck in teeth,\\" she says. \\"[I would also avoid] spaghetti or foods with sloppy sauces, or anything that requires a lot of effort to eat, such as shellfish. \\"During a business luncheon I want to concentrate on my fellow diner, not battling with the meal.\\" You also need to bear in mind the ethical or religious food rules that the other person may follow. For example, ordering the foie gras followed by the veal might not be a great idea, and booking a restaurant that specialises in suckling pig could cause offence. When you have reserved a table in a hopefully appropriate restaurant, one of the biggest questions that lunchtime is - to drink, or not to drink? British etiquette expert Jo Bryant says that alcohol is best avoided because the social atmosphere of a restaurant \\"can easily let us forget that the lunch is for business purposes\\". She continues: \\"Add in a glass or two and you might be at risk of relaxing too much, and saying or agreeing to do something you might regret. \\"It is important to stay sharp and maintain your professional gloss.\\" However, London-based business coach Phil Jones suggests a middle ground when it comes to the wine list. \\"Allow the other person to take the lead,\\" he says. \\"Sometimes it is a loosening of the collar. \\"It's a chance to get some deeper issues, to speak a bit freer.\\" Even without alcohol, conversations over a business lunch can all too easily go awry. Ms Flintoft says: \\"Some people launch very quickly into diatribes about a particular hot [political] potato, and there's a lot of those around at the moment, which makes me question their judgement. \\"But there needs to be a good mix of genuine conversation versus pitching.\\" Ms Nuttall says there should be a number of \\"no-fly\\" discussions. \\"There should be absolutely no talking about sex, politics, religion, bad talking other people or companies, or negatives about your own company or theirs.\\" Mr Jones says people should also guard against venting any personal problems they might be struggling with. \\"One man's wife was having an affair, and I was the first person he'd confided in,\\" he says. \\"I was given the role of therapist by someone who was a complete stranger to me.\\" Wherever the lunch, and whatever the topic, William Hanson, a UK etiquette coach advises being mindful of the other person's time. \\"The worst ones are where they drag on and your host thinks you don't have anywhere else to be,\\" he says. When it comes to picking up the tab at the end of the meal Mr Hanson has a simple rule. \\"Whoever extended the invitation, and has made the reservation, pays,\\" he says. To avoid any awkwardness or uncertainty when the bill arrives, Mr Hanson suggests that the inviter goes one stage further, and gives his or her credit card details to the restaurant ahead of the meal. \\"It takes away the nasty money dilemma at the end,\\" he says. Mr Hanson takes a more relaxed approach though if a lunch with a particular client or associate becomes a regular event. Under such circumstances he says that a \\"turn-taking arrangement can often be struck\\". Ms Nuttall adds that she often thinks that if one of the parties has travelled a long distance, they should be treated to lunch. But normally she suggests that the bill should generally be split equally.

Karen studied animals in school. She started studying predators for a school presentation. She liked it. Her friend Molly liked cows, sheep and other herbivores, so she decided to do a presentation about grazers, and their role in nature. Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Karen learned more about wolves. This is because Karen studied animals in school, and chose to focus on predators for her school presentation. The paragraph mentions that predators, such as wolves, play an important role in an ecosystem and can be considered keystone species that can have a significant effect on the balance of organisms. Since Karen was studying predators, it is likely that she learned about wolves as part of her research.

This can be checked against databases kept by the government. \\"The information will be locked into the card so that people won' t be able to use false identities,\\" said Ren Tianbu, a security official in Shenyang. China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry date and number. Germany, France and Spain all use ID cards, but there are some developed nations who dislike the idea. The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses. For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence to identify people. Identity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems. In recent years, though, ID cards have been linked to national information databases, which form the basis of how a government manages a country. The US, Britain and some other countries are considering a national ID system as a way of preventing possible terrorist attacks.

Diamond Dog discovers Billy Bedlam's corpse and Poe's possessions. Answer:","completion":"Title: The Unraveling of Poe Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Act I The movie starts off in a small coastal town in Louisiana, where residents are preparing for their annual culture and arts festival, \\"Bayou Fest.\\" Among the crowd is our protagonist, Edgar \\"Poe\\" Corday, an enigmatic yet charming literature professor who has recently joined the local college. Poe seems to fit in with the community, and everyone is excited about having him attend the event. Poe befriends another newcomer to town, Diamond Dog, who is a freelance journalist looking for a breakthrough story to elevate their career. During the festival, a mysterious character named Billy Bedlam appears, an art collector from out of town, who seems to have a vested interest in the event and its participants. Act II Poe and Billy Bedlam quickly develop a rivalry during the festival, as each tries to outdo the other in various competitions and challenges. Fans of the two become divided, and the event turns into a showdown between them. As their competition begins to disrupt the festival, the town's council decides to organize a final test to determine the true winner. Meanwhile, Diamond Dog starts investigating Poe and Billy's intense rivalry, having a hunch that there might be more to the story than it appears. Diamond Dog begins to uncover a trail of international art thefts, some of which are linked to the small town's cultural heritage. As they delve deeper, they find out that Billy Bedlam is likely to be the mastermind behind these art thefts. Act III One evening, Diamond Dog sneaks into Billy Bedlam's room to gather more evidence. In the process, they discover Billy's corpse and some of Poe's possessions lying close by. This discovery raises suspicions about Poe's true identity and intentions. Conflicted by their feelings toward Poe, Diamond Dog hesitates to report the findings to the police but finally decides to confront Poe directly. Poe, seemingly cornered, reveals a shocking truth: he is an undercover FBI agent, assigned to the case to infiltrate the art theft ring and expose its culprits. He explains that one of Billy's henchmen had stolen his possessions and planted them next to Billy's corpse to frame him. Oblivious to Poe's true identity, the accomplice intended this to merely seem like an act of revenge during their rivalry. Act IV With Diamond Dog now on his side, Poe takes down the art theft ring, which reaches far beyond Louisiana. Their combined skills expose the members involved in the illegal trade, leading to the arrest of most key suspects.

It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Sea of the Hebrides is a portion of the North Atlantic Ocean, located off the coast of western Scotland, separating the mainland and the northern Inner Hebrides islands (to the east) from the southern Outer Hebrides islands (to the west). To the north, the Sea of the Hebrides joins The Minch. - Skye, or the Isle of Skye (or \\"Eilean a' Cheò\\"), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic \\"Sgitheanach\\" describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - The Cuillin (Scottish Gaelic: An Cuilthionn or An Cuiltheann) is a range of rocky mountains located on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The true Cuillin is also known as the Black Cuillin to distinguish it from the Red Cuilin (na Beanntan Dearga, known locally as Red Hills) across Glen Sligachan. The Red Cuilin hills are lower and, being less rocky, have fewer scrambles or climbs. - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority. - Scalpay ( Scottish Gaelic : Sgalpaigh or Sgalpaigh na Hearadh i.e. \`\` Scalpay of Harris '' to distinguish it from Scalpay off Skye ) is an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland . - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).

The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. It lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe-wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small slug-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. Twenty-seven years later, Chris Romero pines over a love lost, supported by his disabled friend J.C. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and falls instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides to join a fraternity. Cynthia's boyfriend, who heads the fraternity, tasks them with stealing a cadaver from the university medical center and depositing it on the steps of a sorority house. Chris and J.C. find a frozen corpse in a secret room, but when it grabs them, they flee. Meanwhile, Detective Ray Cameron, a haunted cop, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in, where he discovers one of the bodies â the boy who discovered the alien experiment in 1959 â is now missing, set free by Chris and J.C. The corpse makes its way back to the sorority house where he picked up his date twenty-seven years ago. There, his head splits open and releases more of the slugs. Called to the scene, Det.

Process: - Solution caves are formed in limestone and similar rocks by the action of water - After a rain, water seeps into cracks and pores of soil and rock - The water percolates beneath the land surface - Some of the water reaches a zone where all the cracks and pores in the rock are already filled with water - Rainwater absorbs some carbon dioxide as it passes through the atmosphere and even more as it drains through soil and decaying vegetation - The water combines chemically with the carbon dioxide - A weak carbonic acid solution is formed - This acid slowly dissolves calcite, forms solution cavities, and excavates passageways - suppose less water available happens, how will it affect LESS salt being removed from the water. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"In the scenario described where there is less water available, the supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Reduced rainfall would have a direct effect on the amount of water that reaches the limestone rocks, which in turn would have a subsequent impact on the formation of solution caves. With less water available, the process of carbon dioxide absorption by the rainwater would still occur, but there would be a lower volume of weak carbonic acid solution formed as a result. Lower volume of weak carbonic acid solution would affect the dissolution of calcite, thus resulting in fewer solution cavities and passageway excavations. Ultimately, this would impact the removal of salt from the water as the lack of water would limit the process of dissolving the calcite to a smaller extent than what would normally occur. To summarize, the reduced water availability would have an indirect impact on the process of solution cave formation and salt removal, as it alters the efficiency of the dissolution process which is responsible for the overall outcome. The presence of less water in the process does not directly change the chemical reactions occurring, but it does alter their effectiveness and the scale at which they take place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Global Trends 2014, a survey of more than 16,000 people in 20 countries, also revealed how divided Americans are over the cause and treatment of global warming. When asked if climate change is largely man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking last in the international poll and ten points lower. than the next lowest countries on the list, Britain and Australia. However in China, 93 per cent of respondents believe the climate change we are witnessing is largely the result of human activity. Skeptics: When asked if climate change is mainly man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking them last in the poll of countries including Russia, Poland and India. Disbelief: Just 57.3 percent of American respondents believe that we are headed for environmental disaster if we don't change our behavior or habits. The survey, conducted by British market research company Ipsos MORI, also found just 57.3 percent of Americans agreed that we're heading for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly. This compares with 91.1 percent of Chinese and 84.2 percent of Italian respondents, who accept that behavioral and attitudinal change is needed to stem the effects of global warming. Half of American interviewees believe the government is using climate change as a way to raise taxes, a view that is shared by the majority of respondents in nearly all the countries polled. However, there appears to be global consensus on the role of companies in addressing climate change. About 65 per cent of Americans surveyed don't think companies pay enough attention to the environment - second last among 20 nations surveyed. Natural disaster: The remnants of the Jet Star roller coaster in Seaside Heights, New Jersey are pictured after Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012. Environmental Defense Fund spokeswoman Keith Gaby told CBS News that although American opinion is divided, other polls have found a large proportion believe some type of action is needed against global climate change. 'But it is true that a very loud minority has made action on climate change more difficult. I think that's because the issue - which should be judged on science - has gotten caught up in partisan politics,' he said. 'We need to [reopen] a productive, [bipartisan] dialogue about solutions that will help our environment and our economy.' In April, an Associated Press-GfK poll found only 33 percent of Americans were extremely confident that global temperatures are rising due to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. In Gallup's annual environmental poll, 42 percent of respondents said reports of climate change are exaggerated. These views persist despite mounting evidence showing climate change is already affecting coastal flooding to global food supplies.

She can't just jump on the first property that catches her eye. Instead, Patricia needs to consider her budget constraints and identify properties that are within her budget. The first step in this process is understanding her financial limits. Patricia would need to calculate her monthly income versus her expenses. The remaining amount would be the maximum she could afford for mortgage repayments. Ensuring this step allows for a better understanding of her financial capacity and allows her to avoid falling into debt. Next, Patricia should begin her research on the current property market. She can utilize online real estate platforms or reach out to local real estate agents for information. It's important to know the average property prices in the areas she's interested in. By identifying the average costs of properties, she can narrow her search to properties that match her financial capabilities. In her research, Patricia should also consider other factors such as the condition of the property, transportation connections and proximity to services like schools, shops, and hospitals. Although she might not be able to afford as much as Tanya, she should still strive for a property that meets her basic wants and needs. After her thorough research, Patricia would be ready to see some properties in person. She should keep an open mind about potential homes, as they might not be perfect but could be improved with minor changes. However, she must always keep her budget in mind, to avoid falling in love with a property she can't afford. Lastly, once Patricia has found a property she likes and fits her budget, she should make sure to have it inspected before making an offer. This step is crucial to ensure that there aren't any hidden issues with the property that could result in unexpected costs in the future.
