I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet. Answer:","completion":"Giovanni Barbirolli"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was forced to turn down a song since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single? , can you please find it? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The...

Article: Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| The president speaking at the Oval Office—how tall is that door, though? NICHOLAS KAMM/Getty Images White House physician Ronny Jackson gave a rundown of the president’s health Tuesday for the press corps. Unlike Trump’s previous checkup, described by personal physician Harold Bornstein in hilariously hyperbolic language, the numbers struck me as remarkably unremarkable. If someone read me these numbers, I’d conclude the patient in question was healthy. The blood tests and advanced imaging data reported are entirely objective measurements, and in this case they were largely within acceptable and healthy limits. But one result was conspicuously abnormal: the president’s body mass index. At 6’3” and 239 pounds, Trump’s BMI is 29.9, exactly 0.1 units shy of one big league distinction: obesity. Remarkably, the president was found to be exactly 1 pound lighter than a weight that would have pushed him over the edge to receive the diagnosis of obesity. Similarly, if he were merely 1/10 of an inch shorter, he would also be considered obese. Technically, BMI is also an objective measure—you plug in the numbers and see your result. But it can be gamed. The president could have fasted prior to being weighed, meaning that he would have stepped onto the scale while on the low end of an adult’s typical 2–4 pound daily variance and eked it out as merely “overweight.” The more interesting question is the president’s height. The president has long maintained that he is 6’3”, which already observed as at least questionable if not demonstrably false. But further, he’s been reporting that height since at least the 1980s—strange because many, if not most, adults lose around an inch in height as the age from 30 to 70. When was the last time Trump was measured barefoot? It’s striking that the sole aspect of the presidential physical in which the data can be massaged elicited results that place the president teetering on such a conspicuous and, for a man who seems to value optics so much, potentially embarrassing barrier. If the president is in fact obese, he should not be ashamed—he should own it and use his pulpit to inspire others to make healthier choices. But I’m afraid he’ll probably just keep reaching for those extra ice cream scoops.

Question: WASHINGTON — When Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced her vice presidential choice, she referred to Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as a progressive who is \\"everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not.” Timothy Michael \\"Tim\\" Kaine was born on February 26, 1958, in St. Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in the metro area of Kansas City, Missouri. He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

Capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be assumed to be linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and normal (i.e., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What causes the assumption of constant capacitance to fail even if the effect is linear in nature?","completion":"The assumption of constant capacitance in a capacitor may fail even if the effect is linear in nature due to several reasons. Capacitance is ideally considered constant when a capacitor is subjected to a constant voltage or when the dielectric material between the plates remains unchanged. However, in reality, the capacitance value can be affected by various factors such as temperature, voltage, and frequency. 1. Temperature dependence: The capacitance of a capacitor can change with temperature, especially in certain dielectric materials. This temperature variation can lead to changes in the dielectric constant and the physical dimensions of the device, causing the capacitance to be non-constant. Although this effect may be linear over a certain temperature range, it invalidates the assumption of constant capacitance. 2. Voltage dependence: In some capacitors, the dielectric material's properties may change with the applied voltage, causing the capacitance value to vary as a function of voltage. This effect is particularly noticeable in ferroelectric materials, where the dielectric constant may exhibit strong non-linear dependence on the applied voltage. Even if the effect is linear, it still means that capacitance is not constant and varies with the voltage across the device. 3. Frequency dependence: The capacitance value can also change with the frequency of the applied voltage. This is mainly due to the frequency-dependent behavior of the dielectric material and the parasitic effects such as inherent inductance anddielectric losses in the capacitor. These frequency-dependent effects can lead to changes in the effective capacitance, even if the underlying behavior is linear. For example, at higher frequencies, the dielectric material may not fully polarize, resulting in lower effective capacitance. In summary, the assumption of constant capacitance can fail even if the effect is linear in nature due to various factors, such as temperature, voltage, and frequency. These dependencies result in non-constant capacitance values, invalidating the assumption and necessitating consideration of the changes in capacitance when analyzing real-world capacitors and circuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mary Todd Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Love That Bound a Nation: Lincoln and Mary\\" Genre: Historical Drama/Romance Plot Summary: The movie follows the poignant love story of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and Mary Todd, a beautiful and spirited woman with a penchant for politics. Set against the backdrop of a nation divided by the Civil War, the plot delves into the heart-wrenching personal and political challenges that this remarkable couple faced together, as they helped to shape the future of the United States. Act 1: The film opens in Chicago, Illinois, 1839. A young and ambitious lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, arrives at a lavish party hosted by the prestigious Edwards family. Here, he is introduced to their enchanting cousin, Mary Todd, a highly educated and outspoken young woman hailing from a well-to-do Kentucky family. As the night unfolds, Lincoln becomes increasingly enamored by Mary's wit, intelligence, and passion for politics, as they engage in spirited discussions about the future of the young nation. Meanwhile, doubts and disapproval begin to arise from Mary's family, who see Lincoln as a tall and gangly figure from a humble background, lacking the finesse and wealth necessary for a suitable match. Despite these challenges, Lincoln and Mary's bond only grows stronger as their love blossoms amid secret rendezvous and stolen glances. Act 2: As their courtship continues, Lincoln and Mary face increasing opposition, both from her family and from society at large. Lincoln's political foes seek to exploit their relationship, painting him as a man ruled by the whims of his eccentric and headstrong \\"southern belle.\\" However, their love survives these external pressures, and they ultimately marry in a modest, private ceremony in 1842. Following Lincoln's ascent to the Illinois state legislature and later to the U.S. Congress, Mary moves to Washington D.C., where she navigates the cutthroat world of high society and politics, often offering valuable insights and guidance to her husband's political career. The couple faces numerous personal hardships, including the tragic loss of their children and Mary's struggles with mental illness. Despite these challenges, Lincoln remains a devoted and loving husband, supporting Mary through her darkest days. Act 3: Amid the build-up to the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln and Mary find themselves at the forefront of a nation on the brink of war. As Lincoln takes his place as the 16th President of the United States, Mary assumes her role as First Lady, using her political acumen and charming demeanor to bolster support for her husband's controversial positions on slavery and the preservation of the Union. As the Civil War rages on, the movie reaches its emotional climax. Mary, now hardened by her experiences and overwhelmed by the grave responsibilities of her position, watches as her husband navigates one of the most tumultuous periods in American history. In his fight for unity, the love between Lincoln and Mary remains a source of strength for the President and a beacon of hope for an entire nation. In a heart-wrenching final scene, viewers bear witness to the fateful night of April 14, 1865, when Mary and Lincoln attend a performance at Ford's Theatre – a night that would tragically end in the assassination of President Lincoln. As Mary grieves the loss of her beloved husband, the film concludes with a poignant montage of their lives together, reminding the audience that it was their love and resilience that bound them together, shaping the course of American history and paving the way for a more united nation."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Al and Pete for the following movie plot: The film follows Troy (Erik Palladino) as he returns to Los Angeles from Miami to meet with his former partners: Al (Tyson Beckford) and Pete (Simon Rex), whom Troy betrayed years before.

Britain’s top law officer yesterday paved the way for new inquests to be held into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough. Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said he was taking the ‘exceptional’ step of applying to the High Court to have the original verdicts of accidental death quashed. His announcement came after a report into the 1989 disaster revealed last month that 41 fans could have been saved if the response of emergency services had been swifter. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the crush at the Hillsborough ground in Sheffield, but only this year has new evidence confirmed the need for fresh inquests. It also revealed a vast cover-up by. police and paramedics designed to blame Liverpool fans for the tragedy. Families of the victims hope new inquests will record verdicts of. corporate manslaughter. Mr Grieve said he was still. considering the new evidence, but would apply for fresh inquests to be. held on the basis of what he has already read. He said he was making the announcement early to ease the ‘anxiety’ of victims’ families. ‘My view is that I will apply to have. every one of those 96 inquests quashed,’ he told MPs. ‘I believe that. these deaths, arising as they do from a common chain of events, should. all be considered afresh.’ It was clear there were ‘significant. issues over the original inquest’, he added. But he admitted the new. legal process ‘will take some time’ and acknowledged that ‘the wait for. truth and justice has been long and unspeakably painful for a great many. people’. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he would go to the High Court to quash the original 96 inquests into the deaths of the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough tragedy. The report into the Hillsborough. disaster, headed by the Bishop of Liverpool, rejected the findings of. the original inquests that no lives could have been saved after 3.15pm. on the day. Pat Joynes, whose son Nicholas, 27,. was killed, said: ‘I’m highly delighted. We want the accidental death. verdicts quashed so we can get manslaughter verdicts. ‘I have spoken to different families. over the weekend. That seems to be the opinion and it is what I would. want as well – corporate manslaughter and manslaughter verdicts. ‘Ninety-six people can’t die and hundreds injured without someone being held responsible. ‘The truth, in my opinion, is finally. coming out, I’m very pleased. We want to see justice. If that means. police officers have to stand trial, well they should stand trial in a. criminal court.’ Mrs Joynes, who lives near St Helens, Merseyside, added that she hoped any new inquests would be held in Liverpool. Former Labour Justice Secretary Lord. Falconer, who has advised the victims’ families, said David Cameron had. made a ‘huge difference’ to the campaign. ‘You have a government, led by a. prime minister, saying, “This is a huge injustice, let’s sort it out” –. and that makes a real difference,’ he said. Liverpool MP Steve Rotheram said the. move ‘marks one of the biggest steps forward in the fight for justice. for the families in 23 years’. Liverpool fans have spent 23 years campaigning for justice, including new inquests into the events of April 15 1989. ‘The undeniable fact is that the. original inquest was unsound and this application, if successful, will. mean that evidence will be able to be heard after the 3.15pm cut off. imposed by the original coroner in the 1989 inquests,’ he added. ‘For the first time in over two. decades, all the evidence can now be reviewed into the disaster and. potentially a new verdict recorded on the death certificates of the. deceased. ‘At long last, the full horror of. Hillsborough will be on the public record alongside the names of the. people and the organisations that are accountable for what happened.’ He went on: ‘The families’ heartache. has been well documented but what is less well known is that some. families have refused to pick up the death certificates of their loved. ones who died on that day.’ Last month’s report concluded police. officers had tried to smear the dead by checking them for criminal. records and medics had tried to prove they were drunk. Hundreds of statements were doctored to remove criticism of the authorities. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"This article talks about an important decision made by a man named Dominic Grieve, who works in the government as the Attorney General. He wanted to reopen some cases involving 96 people who died in a very sad event called the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, at a soccer stadium in Sheffield, England. The original decision said that the people died by accident, but new information showed that some lives could have been saved if the people who were supposed to help responded more quickly. Dominic Grieve is trying to help the families of the people who died get some answers and maybe change the decision about what happened. This new investigation will look at all the information and take some time, but it is an important step for the families to get the truth and justice they have been waiting for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the father of the girl that the workaholic wants his brother to marry? Answer the above question based on the context below: Sabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's chauffeur, Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David is a playboy, constantly falling in love, yet he has never noticed Sabrina, much to her dismay. Sabrina travels to Paris for a fashion internship at Vogue and returns as an attractive, sophisticated woman. David, after initially not recognizing her, is quickly drawn to her despite being newly engaged to Elizabeth Tyson, a doctor. David's workaholic older brother Linus fears that David's imminent wedding to the very suitable Elizabeth might be endangered. If the wedding were to be canceled, so would a lucrative merger with the bride's family business, Tyson Electronics, run by her father Patrick. This could cost the Larrabee Corporation, run by Linus and his mother Maude, in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. Linus tries to redirect Sabrina's affections to himself and it works. Sabrina falls in love with him, even though she quotes others as calling Linus \\"the world's only living heart donor\\" and someone who \\"thinks that morals are paintings on walls and scruples are money in Russia.\\" In the process, Linus also falls in love with her. Unwilling to admit his feelings, Linus confesses his scheme to Sabrina at the last minute and sends her back to Paris. Before she gets on the plane to Paris, her father informs her that over the years of chauffeuring the father of David and Linus, he listened. When Mr. Larrabee sold, he sold and when Mr. Larrabee bought, he bought. Sabrina jokingly says \\"So you are telling me that you have a million dollars?\\" Her father says no, he has a little over two million and that her mother would want her to have it.

The group consists of lead singer John Baldwin Gourley, Gourley's partner & back-up singer Zoe Manville, Zach Carothers, Kyle O'Quin, Jason Sechrist and Eric Howk. Gourley and Carothers met and began playing music together in 2001 at Wasilla High School in Wasilla. In November 2014, Portugal. The Man were in the studio recording their eighth album with Mike D from The Beastie Boys producing. The band also actively updated their Instagram account with pictures of them in the studio with Mike D, as well as showcasing small teasers of what their new album would sound like. Mac Miller was also shown working with the band as well. The first week of May, 2015, the band released teasers on social networks of what appeared to be new music with a Latin twist with huapango guitars, dream synths and drums machines. On May 5, Portugal. The Man released a Spanish version of \\"Purple Yellow Red and Blue\\" covered by a Mexican-American band called The Chamanas on their official YouTube channel to celebrate the Mexican festivities (Cinco de Mayo). On December 31, 2015, Portugal. The Man posted to their website that they had completed two records followed by separate hashtags #Gloomin + #Doomin. However, on February 3, 2016, the band tweeted from their official account that the new record would be entitled Gloomin + Doomin. In February 2016 Portugal. the Man were featured on the Yoko Ono collaboration album Yes, I'm A Witch Too performing \\"Soul Got Out of the Box\\". On November 30, 2016, Triple J radio debuted Portugal. The Man's new song \\"Noise Pollution\\". It was released as a single, \\"Noise Pollution [Version A, Vocal Up Mix 1.3]\\", on December 2, and featured Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Zoe Manville. On March 3, 2017, the band released a single titled \\"Feel It Still\\", which was followed by the release of an accompanying music video three days later. It was revealed that Gloomin + Doomin \\"failed to complete\\" and was thrown out after three years. They have since completed another album, titled Woodstock, which is promoted by \\"Feel It Still\\". The album's title was inspired by an original 1969 Woodstock music festival ticket stub owned by Gourley's father. It led Gourley to a realization that almost 50 years later, music has the same mission as then - \\"to comment on societal and political unease.\\" \\"We worked with so many rad people on this album, but ended up with just the four of us in a basement at 4 a.m. trying to say something that mattered,\\" said Gourley. \\"Trying to write music that would help people feel they're not alone, even if they're angry or feeling lost.\\" Woodstock was released on June 16, 2017.

Caius is one of the three ancient leaders of the Volturi, the largest and most powerful coven of vampires ruling from Volterra, Italy. The Volturi is the dominant authority in the vampire world, enforcing the laws that govern all vampires to maintain secrecy and order. Caius, along with his fellow leaders Aro and Marcus, maintain a strict and aggressive stance on enforcing these laws. Caius is described as a ruthless and sadistic vampire, with distinctive pale skin and silky white hair. He is highly ambitious and often advocates for aggressive and violent approaches to deal with any perceived threats to the Volturi's power. Campbell Bower's portrayal of Caius is marked by his cold and calculating demeanor, projecting an air of menace and authority that expects absolute obedience from those around him. In the Breaking Dawn movies, Caius is keen on destroying the Cullen family for creating an alleged immortal child, which is a severe violation of vampire law. Jamie Campbell Bower's involvement in 'The Twilight Saga' began with 'New Moon' (2009), where he was first introduced as Caius Volturi, and he continued to play this role throughout the series in 'Eclipse' (2010) and 'Breaking Dawn Part 1' (2011) and 'Part 2' (2012). The films are based on the popular book series by Stephenie Meyer, and follow the journey of Isabella \\"Bella\\" Swan and her romantic relationships with vampire Edward Cullen and werewolf Jacob Black.

Please answer the following question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all.

What can Vijay Mallya do to make things right around him?","completion":"These two questions do not have the same meaning, as they focus on different aspects of Vijay Mallya's life and actions. Let's analyze each question separately: 1. What are some mind-blowing facts about Vijay Mallya? This question is centered around seeking interesting, surprising, or astonishing facts about the Indian businessman Vijay Mallya. Mallya is best known for his ventures in the liquor, aviation, and sports industries. As an answer to this question, here are some such facts: - Vijay Mallya, often referred to as the \\"King of Good Times,\\" is the son of Indian entrepreneur Vittal Mallya, who was the Chairman of United Breweries (UB) Group. - He took over the reins of the UB Group at the young age of 28 after his father's passing in 1983. Under his leadership, the company became one of the largest spirits producers in the world, owning world-renowned brands such as Kingfisher and Whyte & Mackay. - Mallya was one of India's most flamboyant and high-profile businessmen and was known for his extravagant lifestyle, which included a private island in the Caribbean, a historic castle in Scotland, and a massive collection of luxury cars and yachts. - He was a member of India's Upper House of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, as an independent candidate from his home state of Karnataka, serving two terms from 2002 to 2008 and 2010 to 2016. - Mallya's airline venture, Kingfisher Airlines, was launched in 2005 and quickly gained popularity as a premier airline, offering unprecedented levels of luxury to Indian passengers. However, it suffered due to financial mismanagement and competition, and by 2012 had ceased operations with massive debt. - Vijay Mallya’s association with sports was prominent as he was the co-owner of the Formula One team Force India, which was later renamed Racing Point Force India, and a previous owner of the Indian Premier League (IPL) team Royal Challengers Bangalore. - Mallya got involved in legal trouble due to allegations of loan default amounting to around 1.3 billion, owed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines to a consortium of banks. Amid mounting pressure, he left India for the UK in March 2016 and has since been fighting extradition from Britain to India to face charges. 2. What can Vijay Mallya do to make things right around him? This question is centered around the actions and steps Vijay Mallya can take to redeem himself and rectify any problematic situations he may have been involved in. Here are some possible actions Mallya could take to make things right: - Acknowledge and accept responsibility for the problems caused by his businesses, especially the debt owed to the consortium of banks and unpaid salaries of former employees of Kingfisher Airlines. - Work on negotiating a settlement plan with the banks and other creditors to repay the debts, demonstrating a sincere commitment to resolving the financial issues at hand. - Proactively cooperate with Indian legal authorities, returning to the country to face the charges in a transparent and accountable manner, if required and permitted by the courts. - Rebuild trust with the employees, business partners, and shareholders who were affected by the failure of his companies, by maintaining open and honest communication and taking appropriate corrective actions. - Utilize his wealth, influence, and experience in a manner that contributes to the community, helping create opportunities for those less fortunate or investing in initiatives that support social and economic development. - Use his public image and connections to encourage responsible business practices, ethical financial management, and environmental sustainability within the industries he has been involved with. - Focus on personal growth, learning from the mistakes made in the past and working to rebuild his reputation by living a more accountable and responsible life, both in his business dealings and personal relationships. In summary, the first question asks for interesting and surprising facts about Vijay Mallya's life and career, while the second question explores the actions he can take to rectify his wrongdoings and rebuild his reputation. These questions, therefore, have distinct meanings, focusing on different aspects of Mallya's life and experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Britain's oldest man made his first visit to London yesterday at the age of 101. Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea. But, when British Rail offered him an all-expenses-paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse. He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \\"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\\" he said. Until yesterday he had never been far from home, except for one trip to Aberdeen. \\"But I've been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home,\\" he joked. Mr Evans, who spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales, almost made the journey to London once before, at the turn of the century. \\"There was a trip to the White City but it was ten shillings return from Swansea -- too much I thought. All my money went to the family then,\\" he said. During the next two days Mr. Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights. Top of his list is a visit to the House of Parliament organized by his MP, Mr. Gareth Wardell. The only arrangement he does not care for is the wheelchair provided for him if he gets tired. \\"I don't like the chair -- people will think I am getting old. \\" he said. His secret for a long and healthy life has been well publicized -- no wine, no tobacco and no anger. Before setting off from Swansea with his 76-year-old son, Amwell, he said jokingly, \\"I'm glad to see they've given me a return ticket. \\" Question: The very reason that Mr. Evans didn't go to see the world is that _ .

In the article, it is mentioned that Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea, to visit London. He had spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales, which indicates that he was too busy to go too far away from home. Additionally, he mentioned that when there was a trip to the White City, it cost ten shillings return from Swansea, which he thought was too much and chose to give the money to his family instead.

Christopher helped Randy to obtain a federal employer identification number because","completion":"Christopher recognized the importance of having a federal employer identification number (FEIN) for Randy's business. This unique nine-digit number, assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), would help Randy in several key areas. Step 1: Research the importance of a FEIN Christopher knew that without a FEIN, Randy would face difficulties in managing his business's financial and legal matters. This identification number would allow Randy to separate his personal finances from his business finances, which is crucial for tax purposes and maintaining limited liability protection. Step 2: Evaluate Randy's business requirements Christopher evaluated the type and size of Randy's business, as well as the number of employees to determine if obtaining a FEIN was necessary. He discovered that, as Randy planned to hire employees and establish the company as a legal entity, acquiring a FEIN was essential. Step 3: Obtain necessary information and documents To properly apply for the FEIN, Christopher gathered all necessary information and documentation, including Randy's legal name, business address, social security number, the nature of the business, and an estimate of annual employee wages. Step 4: Choose the appropriate application method There are multiple ways to apply for a FEIN, including by mail, fax, or online. Christopher chose the online method for its convenience, faster processing time, and immediate receipt of the FEIN upon approval. Step 5: Complete the online application Christopher guided Randy through the online application process on the IRS website. They patiently answered each question in the form, double-checking the information to ensure accuracy and completeness. Step 6: Submit the application and receive the FEIN Once they finished the application, Christopher helped Randy submit it. The process was smooth, and they received the FEIN shortly after submission. Christopher advised Randy to save the number securely, as it would be necessary for various business operations like tax filings, opening a business bank account, and applying for permits and licenses. Step 7: Update relevant business documents After obtaining the FEIN, Christopher reminded Randy to update all relevant business documents, such as contracts, invoices, and employer tax documents. This would ensure that the business would comply with federal regulations and operate smoothly. In conclusion, Christopher's expertise and support were instrumental in helping Randy obtain a federal employer identification number for his business. By obtaining this essential nine-digit number, Randy can manage his business operations with greater ease, ensuring compliance with the law and protecting his personal assets."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Analyze the question: The question asks for an object that has an accelerator and is owned by most people. An accelerator is a component that helps control the speed of the engine by regulating the flow of fuel or air mixture in an internal combustion engine. 2. Evaluate the options: a. Vehical: It is likely a typographical error for \\"vehicle\\"; however, the term vehicle encompasses multiple transport means, including cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles. Without knowing which specific vehicle is being referred to, we cannot definitively answer the question. b. Fuel system: While a fuel system is essential in powering various vehicles, it is not an independent object owned by most people. c. Accelerate: Accelerate is a verb describing the action of increasing speed. It does not answer the question as it does not refer to an object. d. Airplane: Although airplanes do have accelerators, they are not owned by most people due to their high cost, size, and the expertise required to operate them. e. Car: Cars are widely owned by people as they are relatively affordable and convenient for daily use. Cars do have an accelerator, which is a crucial component for controlling their speed. 3. Justify the choice: Given the analysis, \\"car\\" is the best answer to the question. Cars have accelerators, and a significant percentage of the population owns them. The other options do not satisfy both criteria of the question: having an accelerator and being owned by most people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name who supported himself in England, with the help of George Grove and others, by giving recitals?, using the article: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

Summarize this article: The way players navigate the 3D levels in Sea Hero Quest will be anonymously tracked and sent to the researchers. Understanding how people navigate 3D environments is important because the skill is often one of the first lost by people who have dementia. Researchers say the game could generate an unprecedented amount of data. \\"We have never seen anything undertaken in dementia research at this scale before,\\" said Hilary Evans, chief executive at Alzheimer's Research UK, one of the organisations involved. \\"The largest spatial navigation study to date comprised fewer than 600 volunteers. \\"Providing the research community with access to an open-source data set of this nature, at this scale, in such a short period of time is exactly the kind of innovation required to unlock the next breakthrough in dementia research.\\" The free game was developed by the charity, researchers from University College London and the University of East Anglia, with the backing of communications giant Deutsche Telekom. Players follow a sailor's quest to revisit some of his father's memories, and battle fantastical sea creatures. The routes they take will generate global \\"heat maps\\" that will show researchers how people generally explore 3D environments. The ultimate goal is to develop new diagnostic tests that can detect when somebody's spatial navigation skills are failing. Researchers from UCL said the game generated useful data about 150 times faster than lab-based experiments. \\"In my research team, I could only test about 200 people a year, and that's working hard,\\" Dr Hugo Spiers, from UCL, told the BBC. \\"But last night I tested 200 people in one minute with this game.\\" Players can opt to reveal their gender, age and location to the researchers, although they can choose to take part completely anonymously. \\"This project provides an unprecedented chance to study how many thousands of people from different countries and cultures navigate space,\\" said Dr Spiers. \\"It's a massive online citizen science experiment that will give us an idea of what is 'normal' through this game. \\"If we tile that information together, we can get a sense of how dementia changes over a lifetime, and other demographic factors.\\" Dr Spiers stressed the game was not itself a test for dementia. \\"If you're worried about your memory or any changes to your health, speak to your GP,\\" he said. The researchers plan to share the first results of their data collection in November.

The first to step ashore is Dr. Karl Weigand (Leslie Bradley) the leader of the second expeditionary team to visit the island. Next is Dr. James Carson (Richard Cutting), he is the geologist. Sporting the French accent is Jules Deveroux (Mel Welles). The only female member of the team is Martha Hunter (Pamela Duncan) and last is her fiancé, Dale Drewer (Richard Garland). The seaplane pilot, Ensign Quinlan (Ed Nelson) is anxious to leave as there is an approaching storm. He was on the island once before to rescue the first group of scientists sent to study the island. No trace of the first group was ever found. The group walks up to the house the Navy built. Quinlan supervises the second launch loaded with supplies. Seaman Tate (Charles B. Griffith) loses his footing and falls overboard. He screams underwater and by the time he is brought back on board his head is missing. Seaman Ron Fellows (Tony Miller) and Sam Sommers (Beach Dickerson) are left to assist the scientists. (Note: the characters and actors are reversed in the credits, and Sommers is identified as Jack, even though he is addressed as Sam.) They pitch a tent on the beach. They have a large supply of dynamite and hand grenades to assist the geologist with his work.Quinlan meets the scientists at the house and confirms that Tate's head was gone from his body. Hank Chapman (Russell Johnson) is a radio operator and technician. While the scientists unpack, Hank returns a box of dynamite back to the beach. Weigand questions Quinlan prior to his departure. He wants to confirm there was no trace of the first scientific group to survey the island. Only a journal was found, no other physical evidence is the reply.

Movie title: Dance 'Til Dawn Movie plot: It's the day of the senior prom at Herbert Hoover High School. The prom has been organized by the one of the most popular girls at the school, the beautiful but obnoxious Patrice Johnson (Christina Applegate). When Shelley Sheridan (Alyssa Milano) and her jock boyfriend Kevin McCrea (Brian Bloom) break up just before the prom because she refuses to sleep with him, they are both forced to try to find new dates at short notice. When Shelley can't find a new date, she lies to her friends and tells them that she is going to a college frat party instead. In fact she goes to the town cinema to watch an old horror movie, where she assumes that she will not run into anyone from school. But she bumps into Dan Lefcourt (Chris Young), one of the school geeks, who has also gone to the cinema to avoid the prom.

Spain to Request EU Aid for Banks Spain said Saturday it would ask Europe for financial aid for its ailing banks, a step that would make it the fourth and largest euro-zone economy to require rescue funds from its euro-zone partners. Spanish Finance Minister Luis de Guindos told a news conference that the European Union will grant Spain a loan of as much as €100 billion (125 billion) that the government will funnel to banks that need capital. Euro-zone finance ministers said they welcomed the Spanish step, saying the sum \\"must cover estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin.\\" Mr. de Guindos said, \\"The Spanish government is determined to do its best to protect the stability of the euro.\\" He added that the conditions attached to the loans \\"will be imposed to banks, not to Spanish society, nor to its fiscal or economic policy.\\" He added that \\"the figure seeks to dispel all doubts.\\" Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos says Madrid will ask for assistance for its troubled banks. Deborah Lutterbeck reports. Video courtesy of Reuters. The agreement came after days of talks between Spanish and European officials that culminated in a conference call among finance ministers Saturday afternoon, in which the framework for the support was agreed. European governments put intense pressure on Spain to agree to a support package for banks that have suffered in a real-estate crash—and ahead of Greek elections next weekend that they fear could send a new wave of turmoil through the region's financial markets. The talks extended as Spain tried to minimize conditions on the loans and to limit the role of the International Monetary Fund, officials said. Spain also strenuously sought to avoid the aid being depicted as a bailout like those provided to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, officials said. Luis de Guindos speaks Saturday in Madrid. The 17-nation euro zone is a collection of countries with vastly different economic profiles. See how they stack up on the major measures. The euro-zone ministers said the IMF has been invited to assist in the implementation and monitoring of the financial support to Spain \\"with regular reporting.\\" However, unlike Greece, Ireland and Portugal, Spain won't be asked to implement an extra austerity program beyond that it has already committed to. Unlike in these programs, the IMF won't provide funding for Spain. The IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said in a statement, \\"The IMF stands ready...to support the implementation and monitoring of this financial assistance through regular reporting.\\" She also welcomed the decision to backstop Spanish banks with euro-zone funds. In a report released late Friday, the IMF said it thought Spain's banks need an additional €37 billion in capital to cover losses in a deteriorating local economy. But it added they might need to raise much more than that—between €60 billion and €80 billion—to shore up investor confidence. A formal request by Spain is expected before June 21, when euro-zone finance ministers meet in Luxembourg and after a detailed report is issued by two government-appointed advisers on the banks' capital needs. \\"It was in everyone's interest to have the situation clarified before the Greek elections,\\" a European official said. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said it stood ready to swiftly play its role in the Spanish loan. \\"The Commission is ready to proceed swiftly with the necessary assessment on the ground, in close liaison with the [European Central Bank], the [European Banking Authority] and the IMF, and to propose appropriate conditionality for the financial sector,\\" Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and vice-president Olli Rehn said in a statement. Mr. de Guindos, Spain's finance minister, said the eventual request could be smaller than €100 billion. The ministers said the support would come either from the euro zone's temporary bailout fund or, as soon as it was operational in July, the permanent rescue vehicle, the European Stability Mechanism. \\"That figure is mostly for the markets and doesn't mean that the actual disbursements have to be that much,\\" one official said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble welcomed \\"the determination of the Spanish government to address the [bank] recapitalization.\\" \\"Spain is on the right track and Germany, as well as the other countries and institutions in the euro zone, and probably the IMF, will closely accompany and support Spain in its efforts to restructure the banking sector,\\" he said. Follow every article, blog post, video and tweet on the debt crisis from our reporters across Europe. Mr. de Guindos pointed out that the loans Spain will get from the funds will be \\"lower than market price.\\" Spain is now paying more than 6% for 10-year money. He said the loan will add to Spain's debt load. Officials said the government failed to secure a deal in which the bailout funds would directly inject capital into Spanish banks, thereby avoiding swelling Spanish government debt. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a statement Saturday, said the U.S. welcomed \\"Spain's action to recapitalize its banking system and the commitment by its European partners to provide support. These are important for the health of Spain's economy and as concrete steps on the path to financial union, which is vital to the resilience of the euro area.\\" Spanish and EU officials hope the bailout will allow the government to maintain market access to meet its own funding needs. If Spain were to lose market access for a prolonged length of time, the cost of supporting Spain—an economy twice the size of those of Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined—would be enormous. \\"It's a loan from Europe with extraordinarily favorable conditions and reduces the pressure on the Spanish treasury,\\" Mr. de Guindos said. The Eurogroup supports the efforts of the Spanish authorities to resolutely address the restructuring of its financial sector and it welcomes their intention to seek financial assistance from euro area member states to this effect. The Eurogroup has been informed that the Spanish authorities will present a formal request shortly and is willing to respond favourably to such a request. The financial assistance would be provided by the EFSF/ESM for recapitalisation of financial institutions. The loan will be scaled to provide an effective backstop covering for all possible capital requirements estimated by the diagnostic exercise which the Spanish authorities have commissioned to the external evaluators and the international auditors. The loan amount must cover estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin, estimated as summing up to €100 billion in total. Following the formal request, an assessment should be provided by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, EBA and the IMF, as well as a proposal for the necessary policy conditionality for the financial sector that shall accompany the assistance. The Eurogroup considers that the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB), acting as agent of the Spanish government, could receive the funds and channel them to the financial institutions concerned. The Spanish government will retain the full responsibility of the financial assistance and will sign the MoU. The Eurogroup notes that Spain has already implemented significant fiscal and labour market reforms and measures to strengthen the capital base of the Spanish banks. The Eurogroup is confident that Spain will honour its commitments under the excessive deficit procedure and with regard to structural reforms, with a view to correcting macroeconomic imbalances in the framework of the European semester. Progress in these areas will be closely and regularly reviewed also in parallel with the financial assistance. Beyond the determined implementation of these commitments, the Eurogroup considers that the policy conditionality of the financial assistance should be focused on specific reforms targeting the financial sector, including restructuring plans in line with EU state-aid rules and horizontal structural reforms of the domestic financial sector.

Szekely (born September 12, 1967), better known by his stage name Louis C.K. (), is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor. In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. C.K. was born Louis A. Szekely in Washington, D.C. on September 12, 1967, the son of software engineer Mary Louise (nee Davis) and economist Luis Szekely. His parents met at Harvard University, where his mother was completing her degree in a summer school program. They were married at St. Francis Church in Traverse City, Michigan. C.K. has three sisters. His paternal grandfather, Dr. Geza Szekely Schweiger, was a Hungarian Jewish surgeon whose family moved to Mexico, where he met C.K.'s Mexican paternal grandmother, Rosario Sanchez Morales. C.K.'s mother, an American with Irish ancestry, grew up on a farm in Michigan. She graduated from Owosso High School in Owosso, Michigan. She attended University of Michigan and graduated from Ohio State University Phi Beta Kappa. C.K.'s maternal grandparents were M. Louise Davis and Alfred C. Davis. When C.K. was a year old, his family moved to his father's home country of Mexico, where his father had earned a degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico prior to graduating from Harvard. C.K.'s first language was Spanish; it was not until after they moved back to the U.S. when he was seven that he began to learn English. He has said that he has since forgotten much of his Spanish. When C.K. left Mexico with his family, they moved back to the United States and settled in Boston. Upon moving from Mexico to suburban Boston, C.K. wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, and George Carlin as some of his influences. When he was 10, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much and when he remarried, C.K.'s father converted to Orthodox Judaism, the faith of his new wife. C.K. and his three sisters were raised by their single mother in Newton, Massachusetts. The fact that his mother had only \\"bad\\" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. C.K.'s mother raised her children as Catholic and they attended after-school Catholic class until they completed communion. C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in Mexico. C.K.'s paternal uncle Dr. Francisco Szekely is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000-2003). C.K. attended Newton North High School, and graduated in 1985. He graduated with future Friends star Matt LeBlanc. After graduation, C.K. worked as an auto mechanic and at a public access TV cable station in Boston. According to C.K., working in public access TV gave him the tools and technical knowledge to make his short films and later his television shows. \\"Learning is my favorite thing\\", he said. He also worked for a time as a cook and in a video store.

On November 13, Soviet Russia renounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and began the Soviet westward offensive of 1918-1919. The Bolsheviks followed retreating German troops and attacked Lithuania and Poland from the east trying to prevent their independence. They attempted to spread the global proletarian revolution, establish Soviet republics in the region, and join the German and the Hungarian Revolutions. The Soviet offensive sparked a series of local wars, including the Polish-Soviet War and the Lithuanian-Soviet War. At first, the Soviets were successful, but came to a halt in February 1919. In March-April both Lithuanians and Poles began their offensives against the Soviets. The three armies met in the Vilnius Region. Polish-Lithuanian relations at the time were not immediately hostile, but grew worse as each side refused to compromise. On April 19, 1919, the Polish Army captured Vilnius. At first, both Poles and Lithuanians cooperated against the Soviets, but soon the cooperation gave way to increasing hostility. Lithuania claimed neutrality in the Polish-Soviet War. As the Polish Army forced its way further into Lithuania, the first clashes between Polish and Lithuanian soldiers occurred on April 26 and May 8, 1919, near Vievis. Though there was no formal state of war and few casualties, by July newspapers reported increasing clashes between Poles and Lithuanians, primarily around the towns of Merkinė and Širvintos. Direct negotiations in Kaunas between May 28 and June 11, 1919, collapsed as neither side agreed to compromise.

Article: I recently had dinner with someone who told me that one of his best friends had been killed in a private plane crash, and something happened at the memorial service that he'll never forget. He shared the story with me. At the memorial service, his friend's wife walked to the platform to speak to the gathering. She said a friend had asked her the best memory she had of their life together. At the moment, she had been too sad to answer, but she had thought about it since and wanted to answer the question. They were in their late forties when he died, and she began talking about a time in their life almost twenty years earlier. She had quit her job to obtain her master's degree, and her husband never hesitated in his support. He held down his own job and also did the cooking, cleaning, and other housework while she studied for her degree. One time they both stayed up all night. She was finishing her paper, and he was preparing for an important business meeting.

When he walks nearer to the camera and we see his face in closeup, we hear the words \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" He is the narrator (Richard Basehart), a young man who has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided to see a different world by signing on to a whaling ship. By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction, where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships, townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor, Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod, a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano), and he makes a prophecy, that the day you smell land where there...

The movie \\"Moby Dick\\" follows the story of Ishmael and his journeys on the whaling ship Pequod, along with Queequeg, and the mysterious Captain Ahab.

A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations.

This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

The Mangapinna squid, sometimes referred to as the bigfin or long-arm squid, is around 26ft in length with thin elastic tentacles thought to be between 15 to 20 times larger than the squid’s body. Adult bigfins have never been captured or sampled but rare video footage recorded by the Shell Oil company reveals their alien-like behaviour. Scroll down for video. The giant squid, pictured, was caught on camera in the Gulf of Mexico. It has elastic tentacles thought to be 15 to 20 times longer than the squid's body and the total length is around 26ft. Its ten appendages are often held at right angles to the body, or mantle, which gives them the appearance of having elbows. Mangapinna squids were first discovered. in 1907 but it wasn’t until 1988 that the first footage was filmed off the. coast of Brazil. A squid spotted in 2000 was thought to. have been around 23ft long and more recent sightings have estimated. lengths of 26ft. The arms and the tentacles of the. Mangapinna squid are the same length and look identical. These ten appendages are also often held at right angles to the body, or mantle,. which gives them the appearance of having elbows. Very little is known about the feeding behaviour of these squid. Scientists believe that bigfin squid feed by dragging their arms and tentacles along the seafloor, and grabbing organisms off the floor. They may however simply use a trapping technique, waiting passively for prey to bump into their arms. The footage was captured using a remotely operated underwater vehicle known as an ROV. Shell Oil, along with other companies, uses the vehicles to study the water around its oil rigs and this particular recording was filmed in the Gulf of Mexico in the Perdido Area of Alaminos Canyon. The rare sighting of the squid was discovered at a depth of more than 7,800 ft back in November 2007. Shell oil has a rig located 200 miles off the coast of Houston, Texas. Mangapinna squids were first discovered in 1907 but it wasn’t until 1988 that the first footage of the bizarre creatures were caught on camera by a submersible off the coast of Brazil. Ten years later a Japanese submersible called Shinkai 6500 filmed another long-armed squid in the Indian Ocean south of Mauritius. The majority of other sightings have been in various canyons in the Gulf of Mexico. A. squid spotted in 2000 was thought to have been around 23ft long. However, more recent sightings have estimated lengths in excess of 26ft. Aside from their overall lengths, the. arms and the tentacles of the Mangapinna squid are the same length and. look identical. Squids traditionally have two shorter arms and eight. longer tentacles. These ten. appendages of the Mangapinna are also often held at right angles to the. body, or mantle, which gives them the appearance of having elbows. Shell oil uses remote-controlled vehicles to study the water around its oil rigs and this particular recording, pictured, was filmed in the Gulf of Mexico in the Perdido Area of Alaminos Canyon. The rare sighting of the squid was discovered at a depth of more than 7,800ft in November 2007. The. arms and tentacles are said to stretch up to 20 times longer than the. mantle while the fins are larger than other species and in some. sightings were around 90 per cent as big. It. is thought the squids use their long arms to grab or trap food along. the floor of the ocean, although this has never been seen in action.

Aside from their overall lengths, the arms and the tentacles of the Mangapinna squid, pictured, are the same length and look identical - squids traditionally have two shorter arms and eight longer tentacles. Adult specimens of the Mangapinna squid, pictured, have never been captured or scientifically sampled but it is thought their long appendages are used to trap food on the ocean floor. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"In the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, there is a really interesting type of squid called the Mangapinna squid. It's also known as the bigfin or long-arm squid. This squid has super long, stretchy tentacles that can be 15 to 20 times bigger than its body! The total length can be around 26 feet, which is really long! People first found out about this squid in 1907, but they didn't get to see it on video until 1988. This squid has ten arms that look like they have elbows because they are bent at right angles. We're not exactly sure how these squids catch their food, but we think they might drag their long arms along the sea floor and grab things to eat. Or they might just wait for food to bump into their arms. We don't know much about these squids because they are hard to find and nobody has ever caught a grown-up one. But we do have some videos of them that were taken by underwater robots in places like the Gulf of Mexico, where big companies like Shell Oil use these robots to study the water around their oil rigs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace. - Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. - Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom.

Write an article based on this summary: – On his way to dinner in Portland yesterday, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber spotted a woman unconscious along the roadside—so he halted his driver, \\"jumped out of the vehicle,\\" and hurried over, a spokesperson tells the Oregonian. Making use of skills from his days as an emergency-room doctor, he administered CPR to the woman, who was not breathing. His rep tells CNN she \\"apparently overdosed\\" on heroin. Kitzhaber had one of his guards call for medical help, and the woman had her heartbeat restored with a defibrillator. She's since been hospitalized and is expected to survive, says a fire official. \\"The governor wishes her well and hopes that she seeks treatment in order to avoid the bad situation she was faced with today,\\" his office tells KGW. Kitzhaber took similar action on the campaign trail in 2010. During a debate, an audience member had a seizure, CNN reports. The debate was paused as Kitzhaber ran to the man to help him until medics could get there. Oh, and he also trapped an intruder in a revolving door in 2005. (He and Sen. Cory Booker might have a lot to talk about.) Article:","completion":"Title: Oregon Governor Saves Woman's Life on Portland Roadside Yesterday in Portland, an ordinary evening turned into a life-saving mission when Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber witnessed a troubling scene on his way to dinner. Seeing a woman unconscious on the roadside, Governor Kitzhaber suspended his initial plans and wasted no time in rushing to her aid, according to a spokesperson quoted by The Oregonian. The governor, a former emergency room doctor, put his medical expertise to use immediately. The woman was not breathing, a possible victim of a heroin overdose, as later suggested by Kitzhaber's representative. Demonstrating the instinct and quick thinking his medical career demanded, Governor Kitzhaber ordered one of his guards to call for expert medical help. Always the doctor at heart, he started administering Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to the unconscious woman himself. With some luck and crucial medical intervention in the form of a defibrillator, the woman's heartbeat was restored before she was rushed to the hospital where she remains under intense care, and is favorable to survive as per a fire official. Following the incident, Governor Kitzhaber's office reached out with a heartfelt message to the local news channel KGW, \\"The governor wishes her well and hopes that she seeks treatment in order to avoid the bad situation she was faced with today.\\" Interestingly, this is not the first time that Kitzhaber has switched from his governor's role to a rescuer's role in of a blink of an eye. During a political campaign debate in 2010, he had taken similar action when an audience member had a seizure. As CNN reports, the debate was paused and Governor Kitzhaber ran to the man, helping him until the arrival of professional medical help. Adding to his heroic exploits, there was also an unforgettable incident in 2005 when the governor managed to trap an intruder in a revolving door. Whether it be medical emergencies or security alerts, it seems that Governor Kitzhaber's past experiences have equipped him with a knack for handling critical situations on and off the job. As the news of his recent lifesaving act spreads, Sen. Cory Booker may find himself having much to discuss with the valorous Governor. Governor Kitzhaber's quick and decisive action on the Portland roadside serves as a strong reminder that behind the political role, he is a man who never fails to seize the moment when a life is on the line."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right. - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is... - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals. - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\"). - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances. - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

News article: An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had mostly male DNA has given birth to twins. Doctors have called the event a 'medical miracle' and said it is akin to a man giving birth. The 32-year-old had an intersex condition, in which she had the physical appearance of a woman, but more than 95 per cent male chromosomes. In humans, gender is determined by chromosomes. Women have XX chromosomes, while men have XY chromosomes. Medical miracle: An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had 95 per cent male DNA has given birth to twins. The woman, who was treated in Meirut, looked female but had mostly male XX chromosomes. She had never gone through puberty, had no ovaries and had never menstruated - but she did have an undeveloped womb The woman, whose chromosomes were almost entirely XY, did not undergo puberty and had never menstruated. It was discovered she had an intersex condition when she went to seek fertility treatment in order to become pregnant. 'When we investigated further we found that she had a very small vagina and an infantile uterus,' fertility specialist Dr Sunil Jindal said. An infantile uterus is an undeveloped womb. Doctors diagnosed her with XY gonadal dysgenesis, in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function, the Times of India reports. Ovaries are usually necessary for reproduction, as they create and release the eggs from which babies grow. The lady underwent more than 12 months of hormonal and other medical treatment to develop her 'infantile uterus' and allow her to eventually conceive. WHAT IS XY GONADAL DYSGENESIS? XY gonadal dysgenesis is a rare intersex condition in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function. It affects one in a million people. The chances of a person with this condition conceiving are very slim - and success is classed as a 'medical miracle', doctors said. There have only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world. 'It is akin to a male delivering twins,' a fertility expert said. Her husband's sperm was used to fertilise a donor egg which was then implanted in the woman's uterus, which had been developed by the fertility treatment. Once she became pregnant, doctors had to overcome another problem. 'Our biggest challenge was how to administer this pregnancy for nine months in a body not designed for it,' said Dr Anshu Jindal, medical director at Jindal Hospital, where the babies were delivered, told the Times of India. On Friday she gave birth to a boy and girl. 'This is akin to a male delivering twins,' said Dr Jindal from the hospital in Meerut city, some 70 kilometres (43 miles) northeast of New Delhi. Dr Jindal said his team of doctors discovered during their research that there had only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world. 'It's nothing short of a medical miracle. We are really happy that we could pull it off.' He said the woman was startled to learn she had the condition, but was determined to undergo the treatment to get pregnant. 'Even she did not know she had this condition and was flabbergasted when we told her about it. But the husband was very supportive and told her \\"no matter what you continue to be my wife\\",' he said. The babies were born through Caesarean section, weighing 2.25 kilos (4.9lb) 2.50 kilos (5.5 pounds) each. ||||| ‘Hunger Games’ star’s stunning critique: What if America loved black people as much as black culture?

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Please answer the following question: Randy Poskin, a soybean farmer in rural Illinois, voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA. Zarit pointed to a recent survey suggesting members of his organization wanted the White House to \\"advocate more strongly for a level playing field and for reciprocal treatment to...

Who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline. There is so many changes, that it wasn't really worthy of the Title. Character changes, plot changes, time line changes... First off who was Henry and the investigator? They weren't in the story. Henry had Mitch's persona somewhat, but Mitch wasn't a cop. No you made it so Roz, helped 'sink ' his body and used that as Zenia's blackmail against Roz. The real so called blackmail was Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. Her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being Gay from his mother. Her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story. Neither I don't believe was his lover, Roz's secretary. Tony and West were not together in the beginning. He was actually with Zenia first while in college. The black painted apartment was their Idea, Tony just went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, become fast friends. Tony hides her love for West. Then Zenia left west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony get together. Eventually marry, at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time. Only to be heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. Now being a Professor at College she didn't want to let it get out. I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. Charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. Zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive. No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy. Augusta's father, he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war. Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis's nose while taking care of them both. Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name. Zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's.... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she OD'd. She was also really dieing of Cancer this time around.

Palermo (Italian: [paˈlɛrmo] ( listen), Sicilian: Palermu, Latin: Panormus, from Greek: Πάνορμος, Panormos, Arabic: بَلَرْم‎, Balarm; Phoenician: זִיז, Ziz) is a city in Insular Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Province of Palermo. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). Palermo then became a possession of Carthage, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of Germany, King of the Romans.

UPDATED:. 01:53 EST, 23 August 2012. Fifty Ways To Play: BDSM For Nice People is the surprise new release from HarperCollins. Just one year ago we would never have imagined that a mainstream publishing company like HarperCollins would dream of releasing a guide to bondage bedroom play - or BDSM, as it is known to the initiated. BDSM is a catch-all abbreviation that brings together the predilections for bondage and discipline (B/D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism or sadism and masochism. While it is a lifestyle choice enjoyed, sometimes to extremes, by people across the globe, it is fair to say that the current popularity of BDSM refers to a sort of 'BDSM lite' - a tamer, more approachable version of the sexual proclivity. And that is just what is portrayed in HarperCollins' new guide. The book, Fifty Ways To Play - which carries the subtitle BDSM for nice people. The publisher bills the book, by husband and wife duo Debra and Don Macleod as A Beginner's Guide To Unleashing Your Erotic Desires - and it is enough to have the more buttoned-up readers blushing into their blindfolds. Fifty Ways To Play claims to offer 50 'edgy and erotic' adventures which the publisher says are 'perfect for the millions of readers who have been inspired by the phenomenal Fifty Shades trilogy.' 'Fifty Shades has broken down the taboos about BDSM and more women than ever are wanting to spice up their sex lives,' HarperCollins said. 'But there is very little out there that shows you how to turn every night into an erotic fantasy. 'From turning your bedroom into a 'Red Room Of Desire [in the book it is known as the Red Room Of Pain] to exploring the fine art of Japanese rope bondage, these 50 edgy and erotic adventures make incredible sex incredibly easy,' they say. Conveniently for the budding BDSM-er, the book is being packaged up and sold as part of erotic gift sets by boxofgrey.com, a website set up for newcomers to the BDSM world. Fifty Ways To Play is being sold as part of luxury BDSM packages on website boxofgrey.com. They have created gift boxes with a selection of props to complement the book, with two different sets on offer to assist the BDSM virgins: the Play Box, which includes a blindfold, paddle, kegel balls and a rope kit, and the Summer Holiday box, which contains a holiday-friendly selection of products that the site says are discreet enough that they can be packed in hand luggage without arousing suspicions during security checks.

In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Paragraph: All marine creatures are not fish. There are some mammals, for example, whales, also live in the water. Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect. For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for...

The smell of gas is one of the best indications that you haven't successfully fixed a gas leak. While you might not always be able to smell a leak, you should pay attention to see if you do notice the smell of leaking gas. Gas smells like Sulphur or “rotten eggs.” The smell of gas is made by mercaptan, an additive that is intended to help humans smell it. Shut off the master gas switch for your home and consider calling a professional if you smell gas. The gas main switch will be located next to your meter -- usually on the side of your home. Carbon monoxide detectors and gas detectors are normally used to alert people to gas leaks in their homes and businesses. While most detectors are stationary devices meant to detect an accumulation of carbon monoxide or other fumes, you can purchase portable detectors. Position your stationary carbon monoxide detector near the repair you've made. If you have a portable detector, move it near (within several inches) to the repair. If there is a gas buildup near the detector, it will sound an alarm. This works because the detector solution or soapy water will bubble due to the force of the leaking gas. Ultimately, this is a simple and effective way to find out if you've successfully fixed a gas leak. Commercially produced gas leak detector is specially formulated to stick to tight connections. If you want to create your own solution, try mixing a few drops of dish soap into a cup of water and spraying it onto the gas connection. If the solution bubbles, you likely failed to repair the leak. Gas detector may be available at your local home improvement store, specialty stores, or online.","completion":"A one-sentence summary of this article: This article discusses the importance of detecting and fixing gas leaks through the use of smell, carbon monoxide detectors, portable gas detectors, and specialized gas leak detector solutions while offering advice on shutting off the master gas switch and seeking professional help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(This is not explained in this film but in the sequel, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.) Central to the plot is a poorly-funded national police unit called the Main Force Patrol (MFP, derogatorily called \\"The Bronze\\" by their enemies), which struggles to protect the Outback's few remaining townspeople from violent motorcycle gangs. The MFP's \\"top pursuit man\\" is a young police officer, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), badge number MFP4073.A member of one of the motorcycle gangs, Crawford Montazano (nicknamed Nightrider), escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. MFP officers chase the Nightrider in a high-speed chase that results in several serious wrecks. Among those involved is a cocky motorcycle cop nicknamed Goose (Steve Bisley), who radios Max. Max pursues Nightrider in a high-speed chase which results in Nightrider's death in a fiery crash. After the dangerous chase, Max' police chief, Fifi McAfee, warns Max that Nightrider's gang will be out for him now because of Nightrider's death.Nightrider's gang, which is led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), plans to avenge Nightrider's death by killing MFP officers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How is toodles appearance discribed?\\" is \\"Black and white with very floppy ears. He had short legs and big paws\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's correct! In the paragraph, Toodles is described as a black and white dog with long floppy ears, short legs, and really big paws. This combination of features gives us a vivid image of Toodles' appearance, allowing us to visualize him easily as we read the story. It's important to have such descriptors in a story as they enhance the reader's understanding of the characters and make the narrative more engaging and immersive. Furthermore, Toodles' appearance, specifically his big paws and short legs, could suggest that he's a breed with these particular characteristics, such as a basset hound or a dachshund, although the story doesn't explicitly mention the breed. This detailed description gives us an insight into the dog's physical traits and how they may impact the way he interacts with his surroundings, such as being agile enough to chase the ducks or having an expressive face to show his emotions after the duck bites his ear. Toodles is portrayed as a playful and curious character, as demonstrated by his love for playing fetch and his eagerness to interact with the ducks. His vulnerability and attachment to his owner are also evident when he runs back and curls up in their lap to seek comfort after being hurt by the duck. This characterization creates an empathetic connection between the reader and Toodles, generating an emotional investment in the story. Overall, the story effectively depicts Toodles in a detailed manner that paints a vivid mental image of his physical appearance and also gives us a glimpse of his personality traits and response to different situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1913 , the Astra CM Hydro - avion three - seat floatplane version was used to make the world 's first scheduled passenger - carrying flights . - The Astra-Torres airships were non-rigid airships built by Société Astra to a design by Spaniard Leonardo Torres Quevedo in France between about 1908 and 1922. They had a highly-characteristic tri-lobed cross-section rather than the more usual circular cross-section. This was the result of moving most of the blimp's bracing wires inside the envelope in an attempt to minimise drag. Early Astra-Torres airships could be trimmed by moving the entire gondola fore-and-aft. - Société Astra des Constructions Aéronautiques was a major French manufacturer of balloons, airships, and aeroplanes in the early 20th Century. It was founded in 1908 when Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe purchased Édouard Surcouf's workshops at Billancourt. Its most significant products were the Astra-Torres airships, but beginning in 1909, the firm also produced Wright brothers heavier-than-air designs under licence. In 1912, these were supplanted by Astra's own designs, the Astra C and CM. - Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe (1846, Paris 1919) was a successful French petroleum businessman (known as the \\"Oil King of Europe\\") and an avid supporter of early aviation. He sponsored a number of prizes to encourage the development of aviation technologies, including the Grand Prix d'Aviation and the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize. - The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871 January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867 May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

A more detailed and appropriate answer could be: According to the Economic Survey of Delhi (2004-05), the State Domestic Product (SDP) of Delhi for that financial year stood at Rs. 1,11,886 crores at current prices. The data revealed that the economy of Delhi experienced a growth rate of 13.42% during 2004-05, which was notably higher than the national GDP growth rate during the same period. The encouraging figures were primarily the result of the tertiary, or services, sector that significantly contributed to the region's prosperity. This sector alone encompassed 79.94% of Delhi's SDP composition. Spectacular growth was observed in business services, financing, insurance, real estate, trade, hotels and restaurants, communication, and community, social and personal services industries. The primary sector, which includes agriculture, made a minor contribution of 0.83%, while the secondary sector, inclusive of manufacturing, electricity, and construction, held 19.23% of the SDP. In terms of per capita income, Delhi's population enjoyed notable advantages over the national average. The per capita SDP of Delhi at current prices surged to Rs. 74,816 in 2004-05, exceeding the corresponding all-India average Per Capita Net National Product (PCNNP), which stood at Rs. 23,241 during the same timeframe. This highlights the potential factors that contributed to the economic growth and prosperity of the metropolis. Delhi's economic boom in 2004-05 was facilitated by proactive government policies, an investment-friendly environment, and a talented workforce.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

Step 2: Preparing for the ban In the meantime, Santos, along with his coaching staff, created a plan to ensure the team could still function effectively during the ban. They practiced using alternative means of communication such as messaging apps, walkie-talkies, and trusted intermediaries to convey his instructions to the players on the field. Step 3: CAS delivers their verdict After several weeks of deliberations, the Court of Arbitration for Sport announced their decision. They decided to reduce Santos' ban from eight to four matches. While this would still impact the team's performance, it was a partial victory for the Portuguese coach. Step 4: Adapting and overcoming challenges Santos still faced considerable challenges as he could not be physically present at the touchline for four matches. His coaching staff managed to adapt to the new circumstances, implementing the communication strategies they had prepared earlier. The players also stepped up, showing a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to their new coach. Step 5: Bouncing back As Santos served his reduced ban, the Portuguese national team had mixed results during the first four matches. However, once Santos returned to the touchline, the team's performance improved considerably. The manager's experience and tactical acumen were evident as they went on to secure a spot in a major international tournament. In the end, Fernando Santos and the Portuguese national team overcame adversity, demonstrating their resilience and determination. Santos managed to put his past mistakes behind him, focusing on leading his team to success. The story concludes with Portugal making a deep run in the upcoming international tournament, cementing Santos' place as one of the top coaches in world football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Global wine production is booming with vineyards springing up everywhere from China to the United States, Chile and New Zealand. But when a recent report authored by Morgan Stanley Research predicted a looming global wine shortage, vinophiles took to social media to express their dismay over the bleak news. The report stated that the international demand for wine outweighed production by 300 million cases in 2012 -- dropping to its lowest point in over 40 years. With worldwide consumption jumping by 1% last year, the researchers concluded demand could overtake supply in the coming years pushing the price of wine up. As the viticulture chaos ensued, France's International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) released their very own forecast report that countered Morgan Stanley's analysis. While Morgan Stanley's figures weren't incorrect, per se, their forecast did not take into account 2013's production levels which actually show a return to 2006 production levels, a healthy state of production for the industry. What's more -- Spain, Italy, France and Chile produced record wine levels in 2013. \\"It's how you interpret those figures. For all intents and purposes, for those of us in the West who are consumers, no -- there is not going to be a wine shortage,\\" says Felicity Carter, editor-in-chief of Meininger's Wine Business International magazine. \\"The question is whether there is going to be a wine shortage for consumers in markets that are extremely price sensitive -- like parts of Eastern Europe -- because the cheaper wine that they drink will be diverted to bulk up wine that goes into big consumption markets.\\" Carter echoes the OIV report pointing to the significant increase in production in EU countries like Croatia, Greece, Hungary and Romania and if vineyards from these areas could find stronger distribution avenues within the international market, there will be plentiful bottles to go around. With poor wine harvests in recent years thanks to erratic weather from climate change, Carter acknowledges this could impact wine production levels. While consumers are not going to see a drastic price difference when purchasing wine from supermarkets, she says it all depends on the region of wine. \\"The Burgundy harvest and the Bordeaux harvest this year have been abysmal ... If you wanted wine from the 2013 Burgundy or some parts of France, you're going to have a big problem. You will probably pay a lot more for those wines,\\" she explains. \\"The question is can you substitute other types of wine for those? Now, the answer is yes.\\" She adds: \\"Morgan Stanley, by the way, were not wrong in what they said. They did use very good figures and they do know what they are talking about but the world of wine is just so complex.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1.

Production in 2013 saw record levels in Spain, Italy, France, and Chile, while EU countries like Croatia, Greece, Hungary, and Romania also experienced increased production levels. 5. Editor-in-chief of Meininger's Wine Business International magazine, Felicity Carter, questions whether the wine shortage might impact specific, price-sensitive markets. 6. Erratic weather from climate change may impact wine production levels, and consumers may face higher prices for wines from specific regions, like the 2013 Burgundy or parts of France. 7.

She made learning fun. I remember one day for Christmas holidays, she taught us how to make ornaments from eggs. My parents still have some of the ornaments I made.

Question: Given the below context: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Adam Johnson raised his service pistol and fired a bullseye into the target some 312 feet away. Down went Larry McQuilliams, and so ended his rampage through the streets of the Texas capital, where he’d fired more than 100 rounds from his AK-47 and .22-caliber rifles at buildings. The shot, from Johnson’s Smith & Wesson M&P .40 pistol, hit McQuilliams square in the chest and made the 15-year-veteran the toast of gun enthusiasts around the country. “At a minimum, it was extraordinary shot,” said Army Maj. John Plaster, a retired Special Forces operator, long-range shooting expert and author of “The Ultimate Sniper: An Advanced Training Manual for Military and Police Snipers.” It was not immediately clear if Johnson’s center-mass shot killed McQuilliams, or if the longtime criminal died from a self-inflicted shot a moment later. Results from an autopsy are pending, but there’s no disputing the improbably accurate bullet fired by Johnson brought a safe end to the Nov. 28 incident. Related Image Expand / Contract Johnson used a department issued Smith and Wesson M & P .40 pistol. (Smith and Wesson) “It’s not impossible,” Plaster added. “Wild Bill Hickok shot bad guys from a hundred yards away with a handgun, but he was also a great shot. “I would say what this officer did was phenomenal, especially if he didn’t brace his arm against anything.” McQuilliams, 49, had multiple weapons, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and a map of 34 downtown buildings that likely were potential targets in his pre-dawn rampage the day after Thanksgiving, according to Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. He’d already shot up the Mexican consulate, the federal courthouse and a downtown bank. “For a guy to keep his composure and holding two horses with one hand and taking a one-hand shot with the other hand, it says a lot about the training and professionalism of our police department,” Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said to the Austin American-Statesman. Johnson, who works with the Mounted Patrol Unit, was about to get off duty and stabling the horses when he heard shots and returned fire at 2:33 a.m. On Friday, Johnson, who is on routine administrative leave following the incident, made his first public appearance at a holiday charity event.

Possible answers: - Soak the tip of the marker/pen in rubbing rags for about 10 min., it will soften and renew it. - Soak the tip of the marker/pen in rubbing alcohol for about 10 min., it will soften and renew it. Answer:","completion":"When your Sharpie pen dries out, it can be quite frustrating, especially if you rely on it for various tasks, such as writing, drawing, or labeling. Fortunately, there are several methods you can try to revive a dried-out Sharpie pen. Here is a detailed guide on the best ways to do this: 1. Soak the tip in rubbing alcohol: One of the most effective ways to revive a dried-out Sharpie pen is by soaking its tip in rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol, also known as isopropyl alcohol, has the ability to dissolve ink residues and unclog the pen's tip. To do this, follow these steps: - Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol (about 1/4 inch deep) into a small container, such as a bottle cap or glass dish. - Remove the cap from the dried-out Sharpie pen. - Soak the pen's tip in the rubbing alcohol for about 10 minutes. This will help to soften the dried ink and re-saturate the tip with ink. - After soaking, gently dab the pen's tip on a paper towel to remove any excess alcohol and loose ink. - Test the pen on a piece of scrap paper to see if the ink flows properly. If it's still not working, repeat the soaking process. In some cases, you may need to soak the pen's tip for a longer duration or try another method. 2. Use a water-based solution: If you don't have access to rubbing alcohol, you can try a water-based solution to revive your dried-out Sharpie pen. This method may not be as effective as the rubbing alcohol method, but it can still be helpful in some cases. - Mix a solution with 70% water and 30% white vinegar in a small container. - Follow the same steps as mentioned above, soaking the pen's tip in the water-vinegar solution for about 10 minutes and testing the pen afterward. 3. Rehydrate using a wet paper towel: Another way to revive a dried Sharpie pen is by using a wet paper towel. This method can work well for both permanent and non-permanent Sharpie markers. - Dampen a paper towel with water until it is moist but not dripping wet. - Wrap the damp paper towel around the pen's tip and secure it with a rubber band or tape. - Leave the pen wrapped in the wet paper towel for a few hours or overnight to help rehydrate the pen's tip. - Remove the paper towel and test the pen on a piece of scrap paper. 4. Apply heat: A less popular but potentially effective way to revive a dried-out Sharpie pen is to apply heat to the tip. This method helps to soften the dried ink and make it flow more easily. - Hold the pen's tip near a source of heat, such as a hairdryer or warm air vent, for a few seconds. Be careful not to damage the pen or burn your fingers while doing this. - Test the pen on a piece of scrap paper to see if the heat loosened the ink. If not, try applying heat again for a longer duration or opt for one of the other techniques mentioned above. Remember that these methods may not work for every dried-out Sharpie pen, as their effectiveness can depend on various factors, such as the pen's age, the extent to which it's dried, or the type of ink used. However, using one or more of these techniques may increase your chances of reviving your Sharpie pen and getting it back to work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Scientists studied mutations on groups of fruit flies. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. Which group had more serious mutations? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.","completion":"Based on the provided information, Group A with germline mutations would have more serious mutations. The reasons for this are: 1. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells or gametes, which means they can be passed on to the next generation. This might lead to hereditary diseases. 2. If a zygote contains the germline mutation, every cell in the resultant organism will have the mutation, potentially causing severe developmental or health issues. 3. In contrast, somatic mutations found in Group B occur in body cells and do not get passed on to the offspring. While they may lead to conditions such as cancer, their impact is limited to the individual organism and does not affect future generations. Considering these factors, Group A with germline mutations is likely to have more serious consequences as these mutations can affect the offspring and potentially future generations, while somatic mutations are limited to the individual organism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 21 December 2011 the bank instituted a programme of making low-interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) and 1% interest to European banks accepting loans from the portfolio of the banks as collateral. Loans totalling €489.2 bn (US640 bn) were announced. The loans were not offered to European states, but government securities issued by European states would be acceptable collateral as would mortgage-backed securities and other commercial paper that can be demonstrated to be secure. The programme was announced on 8 December 2011 but observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented. Under its LTRO it loaned €489bn to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one percent. The by far biggest amount of €325bn was tapped by banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain. This way the ECB tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off €200bn of their own maturing debts in the first three months of 2012, and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth.

Movie title: The Last Legion Context: The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 475. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. The two are rescued from Capri by... A:","completion":"Romulus is exiled to Capri."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Definition: In this task, you will be given a food review and a question about the reviewer's sentiment toward one aspect of the food in Persian. You have to infer the answer to the question from the review and classify it. Classify the reviewer's sentiment into: \\"no sentiment expressed\\", \\"negative\\", \\"neutral\\", \\"positive\\", and \\"mixed\\". The mixed category indicates reviews where none of the sentiments are dominant (mix of positive and negative, or borderline cases); hence it is hard to detect the primary sentiment. Also, assign neutral label to reviews that express no clear sentiment toward an entity or any aspect of it. The \\"no sentiment expressed\\" label should be assigned to the reviews where the given aspect didn't discuss in the text.

Solve this instance: Passage: In July and August 1433, Švitrigaila and his Livonian allies raided Lida, Kreva and Eišiškės and devastated the suburbs of Vilnius, Trakai and Kaunas. The hostilities were briefly stopped by horse plague. When Jogaila died in May 1434, the Order resumed its backing for Švitrigaila, who rallied his supporters, including knights from the Livonian Order, the Orthodox dukes, and his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military commander of the Hussites. In July 1435, Švitrigaila foiled a coup against him in Smolensk. Coup leader Orthodox bishop Gerasim, consecrated as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1432, was burned at the stake. The final battle, at Pabaiskas, was fought in September 1435 near Ukmergė , northwest of Vilnius. It is estimated to have involved 30,000 men on both sides. Švitrigaila's army, led by Sigismund Korybut, was split by the attacking Lithuanian-Polish army, led by Michael Žygimantaitis, and soundly defeated. Švitrigaila, with a small group of followers, managed to escape to Polotsk. The Livonian Order had suffered a great defeat, sometimes compared to that which had been inflicted on the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410. On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brześć Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for Švitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Peace of Brześć Kujawski showed that the Teutonic Knights had lost their universal missionary status. The Teutonic and Livonian Orders no longer interfered in Polish-Lithuanian affairs; instead, Poland and Lithuania would involve themselves in the Thirteen Years' War , the civil war that would tear Prussia in half.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. They have been coming since Monday - some with family in the UK and others without relatives here, but judged to be vulnerable. French officials say around 200 children have left the so-called Jungle migrant camp for the UK this week. The camp is due to close on Monday and its estimated 7,000 occupants moved. About 10,000 leaflets are being handed out by the French authorities, telling people to report to a reception point where they will be taken to other parts of France and given the opportunity to claim asylum. But there is concern that some migrants will refuse to go because they still want to get to Britain. How are child migrants' ages checked? The desperate children of the Calais Jungle Migrant children dream of getting to UK - Lyse Doucet The Calais conversation that left Lily Allen in tears There have been scenes of violence as some attempt to board lorries bound for the UK, clashing with drivers and police in the process. Of those children who have arrived in Britain, about 50 to 70 are expected to be taken to a hostel in north Devon on either Sunday evening or Monday morning. Devon County Council said its purpose was to offer a safe and welcoming place for them to stay before being reunited with family members or moved to other parts of the country. Councillor James McInnes said they would be \\"vulnerable\\" young people who would be \\"frightened\\" and \\"exhausted\\". Children who have family links have been admitted to the UK under the Dublin regulation - which requires evidence that they have relatives here who can care for them. Others, without family ties, have arrived under \\"Dubs amendment\\" rules which allow particularly vulnerable children - such as girls and those under 13 - refuge in the UK. The Home Office has refused to comment on claims in the Observer newspaper that some children are being held in an immigration detention unit near Gatwick airport and others placed in foster care. The arrival of migrant children in the UK earlier this week prompted controversy in newspapers and criticism from Monmouth MP David Davies, with suggestions that some of them looked older than 18. He said migrants should have their teeth tested to verify their ages. The call was rejected by the government which pointed out such examinations have been described as \\"inaccurate, inappropriate and unethical\\" by dental experts. Chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Saira Grant, said the process to get children out of Calais had been \\"shambolic\\". She condemned the controversy over the ages, saying: \\"It creates an artificial distinction which suggests that all the others who fled war, atrocities and persecution are not worthy of our help because they are adults.\\" But UKIP leadership candidate Raheem Kassam said the government should publish records of the migrants allowed in to the UK. He told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: \\"We don't want their faces, we don't want their names attached to these things, but we can show these tests have been done.\\" Lord Dubs successfully campaigned for an amendment to the Immigration Bill in April allowing for unaccompanied child migrants to be brought to the UK where they do not have family links but are considered to be at risk.

There have been some problems because some people still want to go to the UK instead of staying in France. The children that go to the UK need to be checked to make sure they are actually children.

Translate \\"Where are the kids, Mahira?\\" to Czech?","completion":"The sentence \\"Where are the kids, Mahira?\\" translates to \\"Kde jsou děti, Mahira?\\" in Czech. Let's break down the translation: - \\"Where\\" translates to \\"Kde\\" in Czech. - \\"are\\" translates to \\"jsou\\" in Czech - it's a form of the verb \\"být\\" which means \\"to be\\". It's in the third person plural, which is used for \\"they\\" (\\"they are\\"). - \\"the kids\\" translates to \\"děti\\". The word \\"děti\\" is plural for \\"dítě\\", which means \\"child\\". In Czech, unlike in English, there's no need to use the definitive \\"the\\" in this sentence. - \\"Mahira\\" remains \\"Mahira\\". Proper names are typically not translated between languages. Therefore, when you put it all together, the sentence \\"Where are the kids, Mahira?\\" translates to \\"Kde jsou děti, Mahira?\\" in Czech.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Fertilization of gametes products something that becomes what?\\" is Embryo. Fertilization is the process by which two gametes (sperm and egg cells) unite, forming a new organism with genetic material from both parents. Gametes are haploid cells, which means they contain only half the number of chromosomes as a typical body cell. When fertilization occurs, the sperm cell and the egg cell fuse, combining their genetic material to form a new cell, a diploid zygote. This zygote contains a complete set of chromosomes, half from each parent. The zygote then undergoes cell division, a process called mitosis, which causes it to grow and eventually become an embryo. An embryo is an early stage of development in a multicellular organism. Embryos can be found in plants and animals, including humans. As the embryo develops and grows, it undergoes various stages of differentiation and specialization, eventually forming all the different tissues, organs, and structures that make up a fully developed organism. In summary, the process of fertilization of gametes produces a diploid zygote, which undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo.

Here's a step-by-step process that Flanagan should follow in order to become a top player: 1. Develop physical attributes: Flanagan must continue to work on his strength, speed, and stamina to excel as a full back. He already has a strong presence on the field, brushing opponents aside, as seen against Juan Mata earlier this season. 2. Focus on defensive skills: Flanagan must constantly improve his tackling, positioning, and marking abilities. As a full back, defensive responsibilities should always be a priority. He should study top defenders and work closely with his coaches to hone these skills. 3. Improve on offensive contributions: A modern-day full back must contribute to the attack while also fulfilling their defensive duties. Flanagan should work on his crossing, passing, and dribbling techniques to provide valuable support for his team in the offensive phase. 4. Learn from experienced players: As a young player, Flanagan should make the most of learning from senior professionals both domestically and internationally. Playing for England and Liverpool puts him in a privileged position to receive advice from some of the best players and coaches in the world. 5. Gain experience: Participating in important matches and competitions, such as the Premier League, Champions League, and international tournaments, will give Flanagan valuable experience that can only enhance his progression as a player. 6. Maintain a strong work ethic: Flanagan should always remain committed to his development and never become complacent. The best players are constantly striving to improve and make the most of their talent. A strong work ethic combined with natural ability is a recipe for success. 7. Display perseverance and mental toughness: Injuries and setbacks are an inevitable part of a footballer's career. Flanagan must stay focused and determined during difficult moments, showing mental toughness and resilience to bounce back stronger.

The news affected Williams significantly, with the athlete admitting, \\"I couldn't shake it out of my mind.\\" On Instagram, Williams found out about the release of Robert Edward Maxfield, the man responsible for the death of her sister, Yetunde Price. She compares Yetunde's fate to that of Maxfield, stating, \\"my sister is not coming back for good behavior.\\" Though Serena Williams hopes to forgive the man one day, she confesses that she is \\"not there yet.\\" After serving 15 years in prison, Maxfield was re-arrested in late July for allegedly violating his parole, only to be re-released a few days later, as confirmed by jail records and Los Angeles County sheriff's officials.

Get a large plastic bucket or a wheelbarrow to use for making the venetian plaster. Pour 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of lime putty into the bucket.","completion":"Once you've poured 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of lime putty into the bucket, the next step would involve the addition of marble dust. Start by measuring a quantity of about 1 quart (approximately 0.95 liters) of marble dust. Please note that safety is essential, so ensure you're still wearing your facemask to avoid inhaling the marble dust. If your marble dust is in larger chunks, you'll need to grind it down to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle before adding it. This is an important step because the marble dust acts as an aggregate, giving body and substance to the plaster. Without it, the plaster would lack the substance it needs for a good application. Slowly add it to the lime putty in your bucket or wheelbarrow and mix it thoroughly. Mixing can be done by hand using a mixing stick or an electric drill fitted with a mixing paddle. Make sure to distribute the marble dust evenly into the lime putty until the mixture has a uniform consistency. The next step would be adding colorants. If you desire a colored Venetian plaster, this is when to add the colorant. It's best to use a colorant that's compatible with lime products. Mix the colorant into a small amount of water before pouring it into the plaster mixture. This will help distribute the color more evenly. Use as much colorant as recommended by the manufacturer or until desired shade is achieved. Continually mix until the color is evenly distributed. Furthermore, some people add a bit of natural soap during this step to increase workability and improve the texture of the Venetian plaster. This is optional but it could be beneficial especially for beginners. About 2 tablespoons of natural soap can be added to the mixture. After your plaster mix is ready, let it rest for a while; usually, an hour would do, some recommend leaving it for 12 to 24 hours for the components to blend well together. Once the wait is over, the Venetian plaster is ready for application. Using a stainless steel spatula or a trowel, you can apply the plaster onto the target surface. It is applied in thin layers and allowed to dry between coats. The number of layers applied depends on the desired effect but typically, 2-3 layers suffice. After application, the plaster needs to be polished to bring out the shine. This is done by vigorously rubbing it with a trowel. With it shining, leave the plaster to completely dry. The drying process might take several days, but the most important thing is to ensure your plaster is completely dry. After it completely dries, it's recommended to seal the plaster with a suitable water-based or oil-based sealer, that will protect the plaster from damage and enhance its durability, as Venetian plaster is somewhat porous and can absorb stains. Finally, cleaning the tools after finishing the job is also an essential step to take care of. Rinse the bucket, trowels, and any mixing tools with water immediately after use, this would avoid plaster remnants hardening thus, extending the lifespan of your tools. It's important to remember that making and applying Venetian plaster is a hands-on job that would take a little practice to perfect, especially if you're doing colored plaster since colors may vary with each batch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her.

Which former MI5 secret service agent wrote the controversial book 'Spycatcher'????","completion":"The controversial book \\"Spycatcher\\" which gave a detailed account of the inner workings of the MI5, British secret service agency, was written by Peter Wright, a former MI5 agent. \\"Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer\\" is the full title of the book which was first published in 1987. Peter Maurice Wright was born on August 9, 1916, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire and died April 27, 1995. He joined the British intelligence agency MI5 during the Second World War. Wright spent a significant length of his career in the MI5 and his main focus was on technical surveillance counter-measures, where he worked successfully on improving the technology aspects of the agency's operations. The book, \\"Spycatcher\\", caused a significant stir due to its explosive contents. The British government attempted to ban it, alleging that the book contained classified information. In this autobiography, Wright made a series of allegations such as the claim that Roger Hollis, a former MI5 director-general, was a Soviet agent. Such explosive claims created a storm of controversy both in the UK and internationally. \\"Spycatcher\\" was initially not published in the UK due to the government's injunctions on the grounds of breach of confidence, though it was published in Australia and other countries in 1987. The ban got lifted in the UK two years later only after the book had been widely available elsewhere. In \\"Spycatcher\\", Wright also detailed alleged actions of MI5, such as a plot to assassinate president Gamal Abdel Nasser during the Suez Crisis, and Operation Rafter, an operation to detect radio transmissions from secret Soviet spy locations. The legacy of the book was enduring; it prompted significant discussion about the rights and wrongs of government censorship, as well as the extent to which a country's own secret service should be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. It pushed the British government to spell out more clearly the previously unspoken Official Secrets Act. Hence, Peter Wright, through \\"Spycatcher\\", became a significant figure in intelligence literature and in public discussions about the role of intelligence agencies in democratic societies, even though his credibility was often contested due to the unverifiable nature of many of his claims."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let us analyze each option: 1. Internet cafe: This option is incorrect as it represents a public place where one can use computers with internet access, and does not directly relate to connecting a monitor. A monitor would be connected to a device, not a place. 2. Display images: This option refers to the function of the monitor, which is to display images or content. However, this does not explain what the monitor is connected to for it to perform its function. 3. Box: This option might refer to the packaging box or a device box; either way, it is an incorrect choice. Connecting a monitor to its packaging materials makes no sense, and using the term \\"box\\" in the context of a device is vague and unclear. 4. View bluescreen: This option also refers to a specific state or error that may appear on the monitor while in use, indicating a malfunction. It is not a reference to what the monitor is connected to, but merely a representation of a possible issue that may arise during usage. 5. Desktop: This is the correct answer. A desktop computer is a common device that requires the use of a monitor for display purposes. By connecting the monitor to the desktop computer, James can view and interact with the content on his computer. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"desktop\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical and appropriate choice, considering that James just bought a new monitor. Among the given options, \\"desktop\\" directly refers to a device that a monitor needs to be connected to in order to function as intended.

Hypothesis: Two children are playing in the leaves. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different scenarios, even though they share some similarities. Let's break down the elements of each statement to understand why: The Premise: \\"Two laughing children play in the waves.\\" Here, we have the following components: 1. Two children: The number and the subject remain the same in both the premise and the hypothesis. 2. Laughing: The emotional state of the children, indicating their enjoyment in both cases. 3. Play: The action being performed by the children. 4. In the waves: The location, specifically close to a body of water or the sea/ocean, where there are waves. This setting implies that the children are enjoying some form of water-based activity in a natural setting. The Hypothesis: \\"Two children are playing in the leaves.\\" Now, let's analyze the hypothesis components: 1. Two children: Shared with the premise. 2. Are playing: The action being performed by the children, same as in the premise. 3. In the leaves: The location, which is markedly different from the premise. Here, the setting implies that the children are playing in or near a wooded or garden area, where leaves are present on the ground. To summarize: - Both the statements describe two children playing and enjoying themselves. - The emotional state of the children, \\"laughing,\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis but may be implied given the similarity to the premise. - The location and the setting are different in both cases: the premise has the children playing in the waves (presumably at a beach or near a large body of water), while the hypothesis has them playing in the leaves (likely in a wooded or outdoor area with trees). Given that these two statements describe different settings, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. It is entirely possible for two children to play and laugh on a beach, in the waves, while still not being true that they are playing in the leaves. Both scenarios can independently be accurate, but one does not guarantee the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched. Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys . The scientists implanted electrodes --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \\" a nice clear pathway\\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee or someone with a injury of spinal cord. The study shows how artificial limbs might be connected to the brain so that a person can \\"feel\\" with... Question: Monkeys tell researchers their sense of touch by _ .

Meat other than chicken can be used, as can paneer (paneer tikka). is tandoori masala the same as tikka masala?","completion":"To determine if tandoori masala is the same as tikka masala, let's compare the two types of masala, their ingredients, and usage: Step 1: Analyze Tandoori Masala - Tandoori masala is a spice blend used in tandoori-style cooking, which is popular in Indian cuisine. - It typically contains spices such as coriander, cumin, garlic powder, ginger, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, cardamom, and garam masala. - Tandoori masala is often used to marinate meats like chicken, which are then cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven) or a regular oven. - As mentioned, tandoori masala is used in dishes like tandoori chicken, tikka dishes (such as chicken tikka), and even some paneer dishes (like paneer tikka). Step 2: Analyze Tikka Masala - Tikka masala, on the other hand, is a creamy tomato sauce used in Indian cuisine. - The sauce typically consists of tomatoes, cream, yogurt, onions, ginger, garlic, and a variety of spices, which may include some of the spices found in tandoori masala. - Tikka masala is often used in dishes like chicken tikka masala, where marinated and grilled/roasted pieces of chicken are added to the sauce. - It's important to note that while tikka masala is a sauce, tandoori masala is a spice blend. Based on the comparison, tandoori masala and tikka masala are not the same. While they share some similarities in terms of spices and usage in some Punjabi and Indian dishes, tandoori masala is a spice blend used for marinating and seasoning, whereas tikka masala is a creamy tomato-based sauce used in various curry dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Some good news for online holiday shoppers: bargain-hunting binges will drive prices down as web-based retailers compete to offer bigger discounts, marketing researchers predict. A recent survey by Shopzilla found that nearly 84 percent of online retailers would offer Cyber Monday discounts, up 12 percent from last year. Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the online response to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when stores are traditionally flooded with customers, some of whom camp at the entrances overnight to take advantage of discounts. However, in the current economic climate, online retailers have felt pressure to offer sales and discounts even before Black Friday. But how online retailers decide to offer those big savings isn't a simple matter of trying to attract the consumers who are watching their wallets, Bohlmann of Sabanci University in Istanbul says. Online stores will also pay attention to the deals their competitors are offering, potentially leading to price wars between certain retailers to attract all those potential bargain-hunting customers. Online shoppers can be divided into two types, Bohlmann said, --switchers and --loyals. Switchers compare prices between retailers and go for the cheapest one, while loyals stick to one brand or store. It almost doesn't matter what price you charge. Online retailers will look at the percentage of switchers and loyals they have in order to decide whether to offer discounts. The more switchers they have, the more likely they will offer discounts. But retailers don't just look at the percentage of their own customers; they also look at the competition. If one online store has a higher percentage of loyals than the competitor, it can afford to keep prices higher. On the contrary, if it has a higher percentage of switchers than the competitor, it might want to lower prices.

He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed. Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins, which matched known intelligence of the time, in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse, although Burge had no past history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison. He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars. Released in 1961, he died in 1964.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: . Rather than have 2-3 big meals, try having 5-6 meals with smaller portion sizes. This can help to prevent overwhelming your esophagus with a lot of food at once and make it easier for you to digest your food properly. For example, you may have a small portion of food in the morning and then several small meals during the day, rather than a set breakfast, lunch, and dinner with larger portions. Food with lots of pepper and other spices can make your symptoms worse. Acidic foods like tomatoes, oranges, strawberries, and lemons can also cause spasms. Try cutting these foods out of your diet to see if your symptoms improve. Acidic drinks like coffee can also make your spasms worse so you should avoid drinking these, if possible. Try not to prepare food that is very hot or very cold, as the extreme temperatures can make your symptoms worse. Eat food at room temperature to avoid aggravating your esophagus. These two habits can make your symptoms worse and cause spasms to occur. Try quitting smoking or reducing how many cigarettes you smoke a day. Limit yourself to one to two drinks a month to prevent making your spasms worse. Esophageal spasms can become worse at night and make it difficult for you to sleep. To stop them, raise the head of your bed by using blocks under your bed frame or by placing a foam wedge under your mattress. Do not try adding extra pillows under your head when you sleep, as this is not an effective option unless you buy a special pillow. You can purchase a special pillow that keeps you elevated. However, raising the bed, or investing in a bed that you can raise up, is a better option. Wait two to three hours after you eat to lie down in bed, to give your body time to digest your food and prevent spasms or heartburn. Keep these areas unrestricted by wearing clothing that is loose and flowy, such as tops that cut low at the neck. Go for clothing in breathable fabrics like cotton and linen to prevent these areas from getting too hot or tight. Losing even 5 to 8 pounds (2.3 to 3.6 kg) can make your esophageal spasms less severe and reduce their frequency. Try adopting a healthy, balanced diet and following a meal plan. Go to a fitness class at your local gym or workout at home using video tutorials online. Try walking, jogging, or biking to work every day to lose weight. These exercises can be done at work or at home in a quiet, low lit area. Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Try breathing in through your nose for a count of 5 and then exhaling through your nose for a count of 5. Do this for 2-5 minutes to help you relax and stay calm.

What is the answer?","completion":"The name given to the silvery aureole enveloping the sun's chromosphere is the solar corona. The solar corona is the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, which extends millions of kilometers into space. It is composed of highly rarefied and ionized gas, primarily consisting of hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of other heavier elements. The corona is characterized by its extremely high temperatures, reaching up to several million degrees Kelvin, and by its faint, ethereal appearance, which can only be observed easily during a total solar eclipse or by using specialized telescopes equipped with a coronagraph. The solar corona plays a crucial role in the behavior and dynamics of the sun, as it is responsible for many of its most interesting and dynamic phenomena. Among these are solar flares, which are intense bursts of radiation and energetic particles emitted from the sun's surface, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which involve the expulsion of large quantities of plasma and magnetic fields from the corona into interplanetary space. Both solar flares and CMEs can have significant effects on Earth's magnetosphere and can lead to geomagnetic storms that can disrupt communications, navigation systems, and even power grids. The high temperatures of the solar corona remain one of the most intriguing questions in solar physics. Despite being farther from the solar core, the corona is much hotter compared to the photosphere (the sun's visible surface) which has temperatures around 5,500 degrees Kelvin. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain this temperature inversion, but several mechanisms are currently being investigated by researchers: 1. Magnetic reconnection: This phenomenon occurs when the sun's complex magnetic field lines break and reconnect, releasing large amounts of stored magnetic energy as heat and accelerating charged particles. This process can cause a rapid increase in the temperature of the surrounding plasma, contributing to heating the corona. 2. Wave heating: In this mechanism, waves generated by the turbulent motion of plasma in the sun's photosphere and convection zone transmit energy to the corona. These waves, including magneto-hydrodynamic waves and acoustic waves, dissipate their energy as heat in the corona, raising its temperature. 3. Nanoflares: These are small-scale, impulsive heating events resulting from the release of magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere. The continuous occurrence of numerous nanoflares may contribute to the heating of the corona. Understanding the solar corona is essential not only for advancing fundamental knowledge of the sun and its effects on Earth, but also for improving our ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of solar activity on our technological infrastructure and daily lives. This is why scientists continue to study the solar corona and related phenomena through ground-based observatories, space missions, and numerical simulations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He began his career in the Asian Underground scene and later became internationally known for his Bhangra tracks, his Hindi remixes, and as a pioneer of Indian-R&B fusion music. - South Asia or Southern Asia is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. - Me Against Myself is the debut studio album by Jay Sean, released 8 November 2004 in the United Kingdom, January 2005 in Malaysia, and February 2005 in India on 2Point9 Records, Relentless Records and Virgin Records. - Asian Underground is a term associated with various British Asian musicians (mostly Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan) who blend elements of Western underground dance music and the traditional Asian music of their home countries in South Asia. The first well-known mention was the compilation album \\"Anokha - Soundz of the Asian Underground\\" released in 1997 and masterminded by Talvin Singh and Sweety Kapoor. It is not a strict musical genre \\"per se\\", since the specific sounds can vary wildly (from Cornershop's Bollywood-influenced Britpop to Panjabi MCs' bhangra-influenced jungle).

We are looking for the value of \\"u\\" when the whole expression equals 0. Our expression is 0 = -7*u + 19*u + 72. First, let's put together the pieces with \\"u\\". We have -7*u and 19*u.

We need to get \\"u\\" by itself. So let's get away the 72 by subtracting 72 from both sides: 0 - 72 = 12*u + 72 - 72. This gives us: -72 = 12*u. Now, we have 12 pieces of something, and they together make -72. To find out one piece, we just divide -72 by 12. So: u = -72 ÷ 12. When we divide -72 by 12, we get: u = -6.

Question: Sunscreens can offer protection from two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays : UVB, which according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, are the chief cause of sunburn and play a key role in the development of skin cancer, and UVA, which get through the skin more deeply and are largely responsible for skin aging and wrinkling, as well as skin cancer risk. The SPF measurement on sunscreens refers to the UVB protection level -- and the number may not mean what you think it does. SPF 15 doesn't protect you from 15% of UVB rays, just as SPF 100 doesn't protect you from 100% of the rays. In fact, as you get into the higher numbered SPF sunscreens (think: 50 and above), the difference in UVB protection is actually pretty small. Theoretically, though the increase in UVB protection with a super-high SPF sunscreen may be not worth considering, it may help, and certainly can't hurt, to use it -- that is, as long as you do so correctly. \\"The only _ is whether you're giving yourself a sense of false security,\\" Dr. Gohara says. Indeed, as Dr. Wang also pointed out, when people choose increased SPFs, they may actually feel so protected by the product that they finally ignore proper sun protection. \\"When people use really high SPF products, they tend not to reuse, they tend to stay out in the sun much longer, and they don't use other protective measures such as clothing and hats,\\" he says. Regardless of any increase in protection that a high SPF may or may not offer, one thing is certain: It doesn't give your body a free pass from sunburns, aging, or cancers, and it doesn't protect you from those things for any greater length of time than the lower SPF options. Both Dr. Wang and Dr. Gohara emphasized that, no matter what the SPF is, it's important to reapply your sunscreen every two hours. Why are we advised to reapply our sunscreen every two hours? A) We choose too low SPF products. B) The higher SPF can make us stay outside longer. C) Clothing and hats are not enough for sun protection. D) It can't completely protect us from aging, sunburns or cancers. Answer:","completion":"D) We are advised to reapply our sunscreen every two hours because it can't completely protect us from aging, sunburns, or cancers. No matter the SPF level, sunscreen's effectiveness diminishes over time due to various factors, such as sweating, swimming, and rubbing. Regular reapplication ensures continuous protection from harmful UV rays and prevents these issues from wearing down the sunscreen layer."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","completion":"The owner of the Grand National legend Red Rum was Noel Le Mare. Born on December 5, 1911, in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, as Noel Saint George Le Mare, he was a successful businessman, engineer, and racehorse owner. Noel Le Mare's connection to Red Rum began when he, together with racehorse trainer Ginger McCain, bought the horse for 6,000 guineas (equivalent to approximately £6,300) in the early 1970s. Red Rum, a thoroughbred racehorse, was foaled on May 3, 1965, and was a bay gelding sired by Quorum and out of the dam Mared. Originally, Red Rum was bred to be a sprinter, but his career took a turn when he joined forces with Ginger McCain and Noel Le Mare. Under the ownership of Noel Le Mare and the training of Ginger McCain, Red Rum went on to secure his place as a legendary racehorse by winning three Grand National races at Aintree in 1973, 1974, and 1977. He also finished second in 1975 and 1976, showcasing his immense racing talent and consistency. Red Rum remains the only horse to have ever achieved this impressive feat and holds an almost cult-like status in the world of horse racing. His 1973 Grand National victory was particularly memorable, as he came from 30 lengths behind to win the race in a record-breaking time of 9 minutes and 1.9 seconds. This victory, along with his other impressive performances at the Grand National, helped cement Red Rum's position as one of the greatest racehorses in history, and by extension, brought significant recognition and fame to his owner, Noel Le Mare, and trainer, Ginger McCain. Noel Le Mare experienced great success in his business and horse racing ventures, enabling him to fund Red Rum's career and provide Ginger McCain with the necessary resources to prepare the horse for each race. Le Mare passed away in September 1998, at the age of 86, but his legacy in British horse racing has endured through the remarkable story of Red Rum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what is right to set off payments A:","completion":"Yes, your statement is correct. In certain jurisdictions, including the UK, set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company. To provide more context, the right to set off payments refers to the legal right that allows one party (creditor) to cancel or reduce the amount owed to them by another party (debtor) by applying it against a debt owed by the creditor to the debtor. In simpler terms, it is a method of mutual debt adjustment where two parties can offset their outstanding debts against each other, ultimately reducing the overall debt burden for both. In the case of insolvency, set-off can be an effective way to manage the risk of non-payment, as it allows the outstanding debts between the insolvent company and its creditors to be offset and cleared to some extent. This is particularly important for preventing further losses for creditors. In the United Kingdom, when a company becomes insolvent, the \\"rule in Cherry v Boultbee\\" operates, which leads to the automatic set-off of mutual and reciprocal debts between the insolvent company and its creditors.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Input: Context_1 : The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. The domestic dog is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The closest living relative of the dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage. The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister clades, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists. The dog was the first domesticated species. Context_2 : The domestication of animals is the mutual relationship between animals with the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction. Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domesticated species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits. There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. Context_3 : Capsicum pubescens is a species of the genus \\"Capsicum\\" (pepper), known in Peru as rocoto (Quechua, rukutu, ruqutu), locoto in Bolivia & Argentina (Aymara, 'luqutu') and as the \\"Manzano\\" pepper in Mexico which means \\"apple\\" for its apple-shaped fruit. This species is found primarily in Central and South America, and is known only in cultivation. The species name, \\"pubescens\\", means hairy, which refers to the hairy leaves of this pepper. The hairiness of the leaves, along with the black seeds, distinguish this species from others. As they reach a relatively advanced age and the roots lignify quickly, sometimes they are called tree chili. Of all the domesticated species of peppers, this is the least widespread and systematically furthest away from all others. It is reproductively isolated from other species of the genus \\"Capsicum\\". A very notable feature of this species is its ability to withstand cooler temperatures than other cultivated pepper plants, although it cannot withstand frost. Context_4 : Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. Context_5 : The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Context_6 : Cucurbita fraterna, also known as Cucurbita pepo\\" subsp. \\"fraterna, is a mesophyte plant species of the genus \\"Cucurbita\\". It is native to Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, Mexico. It has not been domesticated. It is the progenitor and nearest relative of the domesticated species \\"Cucurbita pepo\\" and wild \\"C. pepo\\" is still found in the same areas as \\"C. fraterna\\". It was formally described by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1943, in \\"Gentes Herbarum\\". Context_7 : Jane Hamilton-Merritt (born Mary Jane LaRowe, 1937), in Noble County, Indiana is a retired college professor, photojournalist, author, and animal rights and animal husbandry advocate. She resides in Redding, Connecticut. In 1999, she was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. Some of her work has focused on breeding and raising Llamas and Alpaca. Context_8 : Domesticated species and the human populations that domesticate them are typified by a mutualistic relationship of interdependence, in which humans have over thousands of years modified the genomics of domesticated species. Genomics is the study of the structure, content, and evolution of genomes, or the entire genetic information of organisms. Domestication is the process by which humans alter the morphology and genes of targeted organisms by selecting for desirable traits. Context_9 : Emmer wheat, also known as farro especially in Italy, or hulled wheat, is a type of awned wheat. Emmer is a tetraploid (2n=4x=28 chromosomes). The domesticated species are \\"Triticum turgidum\\" subsp. \\"dicoccum\\" and \\"Triticum turgidum \\"conv.\\" durum\\". The wild species is called \\"Triticum turgidum\\" subsp. \\"dicoccoides\\". The principal difference between the wild and the domestic species is that the ripened seed head of the wild species shatters and spreads the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Ranveer Singh Bhavnani (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. Context: In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead. Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy. To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the Delhi University campus. Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to Yash Raj Films' last few productions, the lack of a male star and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an \\"almost-forgotten\\" actress. However, Band Baaja Baaraat went on to become a sleeper hit. Singh's portrayal of Bittoo was praised, with Anupama Chopra of NDTV writing that Singh was \\"pitch perfect in the role of the uncouth but good-hearted small town slacker who is a bit of a duffer when it comes to matters of the heart.\\" The film earned approximately Rs214 million (US3.3 million) at the domestic box office. At the 56th Filmfare Awards, Singh won the award for Best Male Debut. Following Band Baaja Baarat, Singh signed on for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a romantic comedy produced by Chopra and directed by Maneesh Sharma. He played a conman Ricky Bahl who cons girls for a living but finally meets his match. The film co-starred Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma and Aditi Sharma. According to Singh, the title character had various avatars in the film, including a chirpy, entertaining side and a sinister side. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India wrote, \\"Ranveer is, well Ranveer: your average Joe kind of hero who looks convincing enough as Sunny, Deven, Iqbal, Ricky, his sundry avatars.\\" Commercially, Ladies vs Ricky Bahl earned Rs370 million (US5.7 million) domestically. Question: What was Ranveer's next role? Answer:","completion":"Ranveer's next role was in the movie Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, where he played a conman named Ricky Bahl. He had to pretend to be different people, like Sunny, Deven, and Iqbal, to trick girls. But in the end, he met someone who was not easy to fool. Anushka Sharma, Parineeti Chopra, Dipannita Sharma, and Aditi Sharma were also in the movie with him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: A can is thrown away into a recycling bin. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as it primarily depends on human behavior and recycling habits. Step 2: The can is taken to a recycling center. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as this process is also unrelated to plant activity. Step 3: Melted down along with other cans. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as the melting of cans is a physical process unrelated to plant water transport. Step 4: The melted metal is turned into bars. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step, as it is still a separate process from plant activities. Step 5: Becomes material for other products. - The increased water transport to leaves does not affect this step directly. However, it might have an indirect effect if the aluminum produced from recycling is used to manufacture products related to plant growth, irrigation systems, or other agriculture-related sectors.

Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a portfolio and an ear trumpet.

(October 2014) Spider is the story of Dennis Cleg, a man who is given a room in a halfway house catering to mentally disturbed persons. Cleg has just been released from a mental institution and in his new abode starts piecing together or recreating in his memory an apparently fateful childhood event. He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and his father. A shift takes place in the child's psyche when he witnesses his mother groping with his father in the garden and, subsequently, when he sees his mother in a silky night gown she wore for his father. The son, as a grown man seems to recreate in his memory the buildup to his father's murder of his mother with the passive support of a prostitute he is involved with, who then moves into the house and is presented as his mother. The young son then kills the mistress by gassing her in the kitchen, although the final shot appears to show his true mother lying dead so we are left to wonder whether she really was his mother and the prostitute was just a fantasy. After that memory he sneaks late one night to the landlady's room and appears ready to kill her, whom he sees alternatively as the mistress, his mother and the landlady, but backs away after she says, \\"What have you done Mr. Cleg?\\" He is taken back to the asylum.

The water will turn into water vapor due to the heat. 3. Collect the water vapor using a condensation apparatus (e.g., a container or pipe that captures the vapor as it rises from the heated saltwater). 4.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Original Sin Context: The movie flashes back and forth from the past to the present. A woman is awaiting her execution while she tells her story to a priest.Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a wealthy Cuban businessman who seeks out an American wife, believes Americans represent the future, and that his own countrymen - and women - are mired in the past and their traditions. After months of corresponding with Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie), the day comes when she sails to his country to be his bride. Julia departs from the ship, looking nothing like the photos she's sent prior to her voyage. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is interested in a pretty face, and that's why she's been deceptive - substituting a plain-looking woman in place of her own picture. Luis also admits to deception; he's been misleading her into believing he's a poor working man, instead of the rich owner of a coffee company.Luis and Julia wed within hours of her setting foot in Cuba. Passion and lust lie just below the surface as the two begin to discover each other over the next few days. Luis falls passionately in love with his new bride and expresses it physically (which is a famous sex scene between the two celebrities). But, while Julia seems to be fighting inner demons, she is holding herself back from too deep an emotional involvement.Meanwhile, Julia's sister Emily has been trying to contact her sister, justifiably worried about her after such a long trip to a strange land. Luis forces Julia to write back, fearing that if Julia continues to ignore Emily's letters, Emily will assume something terrible has befallen her sister and might send the authorities to check on her welfare. Holding off as long as possible, Julia finally pens a letter to her sister, setting into motion the execution of Julia's hidden agenda.In order to assure that his wife has everything she wants, Luis adds Julia to his business and personal bank accounts, giving her free rein to spend as she pleases.

Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Why is the meat of geese considered lean?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the given information In the given text, it is mentioned that the flesh of meat geese is dark-colored and high in protein. It also states that geese deposit fat subcutaneously, and this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. Step 2: Connect the key points To answer the question about why the meat of geese is considered lean, it's essential to understand what lean meat typically consists of. Lean meat is generally low in fat content, particularly saturated fat, and high in protein. The provided information states that the flesh of meat geese is high in protein and contains monounsaturated fatty acids as their primary fat source. Step 3: Justify the answer Based on the information given, the meat of geese can be considered lean because it is high in protein and contains a lower amount of saturated fat. The primary fat in geese is monounsaturated fatty acids, which are considered healthier fats compared to saturated fats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the latest Bond movie \\"Skyfall,\\" Daniel Craig's 007 pursues an assassin up a glass skyscraper in the dead of night and meets a glamorous casino host with a troubled past. The action could plausibly have taken place in any of the world's major metropolises but the film makers chose Shanghai and Macau, two of China's most dynamic cities. It reflects the growing importance of China as a market for Hollywood movies and Chinese backdrops, themes and actors are likely to become only more commonplace. But appealing to Chinese audiences is fraught with difficulty as the makers of \\"Skyfall,\\" which has fallen foul of Chinese censors, have discovered. It's understandable (why censors want to remove certain scenes) if a movie contains only a few China scenes and the","completion":"content is deemed sensitive or controversial. However, it's crucial for filmmakers to strike a balance between catering to the preferences of Chinese audiences and maintaining the integrity of their artistic vision. As China's box office continues to grow and surpass that of North America, Hollywood studios are becoming more aware of the need to appeal to Chinese moviegoers. The incorporation of Chinese elements, such as locations and actors, has become an increasingly popular tactic. However, this strategy also opens the door to potential conflicts with Chinese authorities who strictly regulate media content in the country. One of the major challenges faced by filmmakers is navigating the delicate subject of censorship. Chinese censors have a reputation for being particularly strict when it comes to depicting their nation and its people in a negative or controversial light. Consequently, filmmakers are often forced to make compromises or even cut entire scenes to appease the censors and avoid being banned from the profitable Chinese market. Moreover, cultural differences can play a significant role in determining the success or failure of a film in China. What might appeal to Western audiences may not always resonate with Chinese moviegoers. As such, filmmakers need to be mindful of these discrepancies and carefully consider how their film's themes, narrative, and characters will be received by both domestic and international audiences. Ultimately, the growing importance of the Chinese market in the global film industry cannot be underestimated and the need to connect with Chinese viewers is becoming increasingly vital. Nevertheless, filmmakers must walk a fine line between embracing the Chinese market and preserving their creative vision. \\"Skyfall\\", despite its troubles with Chinese censors, serves as a valuable lesson for the industry on the complexities of appealing to a rapidly expanding and influential audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot title: The Wrong Man Movie plot: For the only time in his many films, Alfred Hitchcock starts this picture talking to the camera and says that \\"every word is true\\" in this story. Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda), a down-on-his-luck musician at New York City's Stork Club, is in a money crunch. His wife, Rose (Vera Miles), needs to have her wisdom teeth extracted at a cost of 300, but the couple does not have that much money. Though he has already borrowed against his life insurance policy, he goes to the life insurance company to attempt to take a loan out against Rose's policy. He is immediately recognized by the clerical workers in the store as the man who had twice held up the insurance office. They inform the police, and he is taken to the 110th Precinct by detectives. Without being told why, Manny is instructed to walk in and out of a liquor store and delicatessen, both scenes of a robbery earlier that year. He is then asked by police to give a handwriting sample, writing the words from the stick-up note at the insurance company. Manny misspells the word \\"drawer\\" as \\"draw\\"âthe same spelling mistake the robber made in the note. After being picked out of a police lineup by the women from the insurance company, he is then arrested and charged with robbery, and his family finds out that he will be in court on the following morning. Attorney Frank O'Connor (Anthony Quayle) sets out to prove that Manny cannot possibly be the right man: at the time of the first hold-up he was on vacation with his family, and at the time of the second his jaw was so swollen that witnesses would certainly have noticed. Manny and Rose look for three people who saw Manny at the vacation hotel, but two have died and the third cannot be found. All this devastates Rose, whose resulting depression forces her to be hospitalized. During Manny's trial a juror, bored with the minutiae of one witness's testimony, makes a remark which prompts the judge to declare a mistrial.

He is the son of Carol (nee Lutz) and Warren Elliott Norquist (a vice president of Polaroid Corporation), and is of Swedish ancestry. His brother, David Norquist has served in senior posts in Republican administrations at both the United States Department of Defense and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Norquist became involved with politics at an early age when he volunteered for the 1968 Nixon campaign, assisting with get out the vote efforts. Prior to the November 2012 election, 238 of 242 House Republicans and 41 out of 47 Senate Republicans had signed ATR's \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\\", in which the pledger promises to \\"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rate for individuals and business; and to oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\\" The November 6, 2012 elections resulted in a decline in the number of Taxpayer Protection Pledge signatories in both the upper and lower houses of the 113th Congress: from 41 to 39 in the Senate, and from 238 to \\"fewer than ... 218\\" in the House of Representatives. According to journalist Alex Seitz-Wald, losses in the election by Norquist supporters and the \\"fiscal cliff\\" have emboldened and made more vocal critics of Norquist. In November 2011, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) blamed Norquist's influence for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction's lack of progress, claiming that Congressional Republicans \\"are being led like puppets by Grover Norquist. They're giving speeches that we should compromise on our deficit, but never do they compromise on Grover Norquist. He is their leader.\\" Since Norquist's pledge binds signatories to opposing deficit reduction agreements that include any element of increased tax revenue, some Republican deficit hawks now retired from office have stated that Norquist has become an obstacle to deficit reduction. Former Republican Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), co-chairman of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, has been particularly critical, describing Norquist's position as \\"[n]o taxes, under any situation, even if your country goes to hell.\\" When was the pledge put in place?","completion":"The \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\\" by Grover Norquist was first introduced in 1986.

Answer based on context: Coming off a bad loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Jaguars looked to rebound against their division rival Indianapolis Colts. Indianapolis scored on its first possession as running back Joseph Addai ran it in from two yards out to make the score 7-0 Colts. After two touchdown runs by David Garrard and Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars took the lead in the second quarter, 14-7. Their lead didn't last very long as quarterback Peyton Manning threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark, tying the game at 14 heading into halftime. The Jaguars regained the lead in the third quarter with Garrard finding tight end Marcedes Lewis for a fifteen-yard touchdown pass. Jacksonville took the lead 21-14. Once again, the Colts responded when Addai scored on a two-yard touchdown run tying the game at 21. With 2:13 left in the game, Garrard completed it to Maurice Jones-Drew for an eight-yard touchdown pass and the Jaguars took a 28-21 lead. That was enough time for 4 time MVP Peyton Manning, however as he hooked up with wide receiver Austin Collie for a one-yard touchdown that appeared as if it would send the game into overtime. The Jaguars got the ball back with 0:42 left on the clock, with the game tied. After a few short plays, the ball was at the Jacksonville 37-yard line with 0:33 left to play. Garrard then threw a deep pass to wide receiver Tiquan Underwood who caught it along the left sideline with 0:18 remaining in the game. Two plays later, kicker Josh Scobee lined up for a fifty-nine-yard field goal to win the game. Scobee's kick set a record for longest field goal in Jaguars franchise history. How many touchdowns were scored in the first two quarters?","completion":"In the first two quarters, four touchdowns were scored. Here's the breakdown: 1. Joseph Addai's 2-yard run for the Colts. 2.

Question: \\"Detroit is NOT in what area of the United States?\\" Context: \\"Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer.

Neither was Kercher's family, which said in a statement submitted by their lawyer in court on Monday that they would be following the new trial closely from the United Kingdom. Knox was convicted in 2009 of murdering Kercher, a 21-year old British exchange student who was found stabbed to death in November 2007 in the villa the two young women rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia.

Real Salt Lake hit back with 25 minutes left when Robbie Findley reacted first after Yuri Movsisyan's attempt on goal was blocked, tying the match and setting up the penalty shootout. Beckham got the Galaxy off to a good start in the shoot out as he scored with confidence, but his team could not follow in the same manner. Jovan Kirovski's shot was blocked by Rimando, but Saunders followed by stopping the effort of Salt Lake captain Kyle Beckerman before Donovan blazed over the crossbar to leave the score 5-4.

The answer to the question: What song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics? is inside the article: The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".

Remove the steel from the quenching medium when it stops bubbling.","completion":"Title: The Art of Quenching Steel: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Optimal Hardness and Material Properties Introduction Quenching is an essential process in the heat treatment of steel and various other metallic alloys. It is a method used to quickly cool down a heated material, typically using water or oil, in order to achieve desirable mechanical properties such as hardness, ductility, and tensile strength. This rapid cooling process is crucial in attaining martensitic transformation – a phenomenon responsible for the enhanced strength and hardness in steel. In this article, we will delve into the step-by-step process of quenching steel using a heat-safe container filled with water or oil, as well as discuss some important factors to consider for optimal results. Step 1: Preparing the Heat-Safe Container and Quenching Medium The first step in the quenching process is selecting an appropriate heat-safe container that is large enough to submerge your steel. Common choices for containers include steel buckets, metal troughs, or even a sizeable cooking pot. It is important to choose a container made from a material that can withstand high temperatures without cracking or melting, as the steel will be extremely hot when it is quenched. Next, you need to choose a suitable quenching medium. Water and oil are the most popular choices, although some specialized applications may require other cooling materials. Water is often chosen for its excellent heat absorption capacity, but it can cause issues like steam bubbles or cracking in certain steel alloys. Oil, on the other hand, provides a slower and more controlled cooling process, which can significantly reduce the risk of cracking or distortion. Make sure the container is filled with an adequate amount of quenching medium to completely submerge the steel. Step 2: Heating the Steel Before you begin the quenching process, it is crucial to ensure that your steel is heated to the appropriate temperature. This is determined by the specific steel alloy being used, the desired mechanical properties, and the size and shape of the component. Generally, the steel should be heated to a temperature within the range of 1500°F to 1900°F (815°C to 1040°C), known as the \\"austenitizing temperature\\". During the heating process, it is important to heat the steel evenly and monitor the temperature closely. This can be done by using a furnace, an oxy-acetylene torch, or in some cases, a forge. The heating method employed will depend on the size of the steel piece and the resources available. Step 3: Quenching the Steel Once the steel has reached its austenitizing temperature, it is time to quench it in the prepared container with water or oil. Take necessary precautions, such as wearing heat-resistant gloves and safety goggles, to avoid any injuries during this procedure. Carefully submerge the heated steel into the quenching medium, making sure it is fully immersed to ensure uniform cooling. The steel will begin to react with the quenching medium, causing it to bubble and produce vapors. Gently move the steel within the container for even cooling and to prevent any vapor pockets from forming, which can impact the quenching process. Step 4: Removing the Steel from the Quenching Medium Once the steel has stopped bubbling, which indicates that it has been effectively cooled, gently remove it from the quenching medium. Carefully inspect the steel for any signs of distortion or cracking, which could have occurred during the quenching process. If any issues are observed, it is essential to identify the cause and modify the quenching process accordingly. Step 5: Tempering the Steel At this point, the steel is in a harder but more brittle state. To achieve the desired balance of hardness and ductility, tempering is a crucial next step. The tempering process involves heating the steel to a lower temperature than the austenitizing temperature, and then allowing it to cool slowly. This results in a more ductile and less brittle material – a characteristic ideal for various engineering and manufacturing applications. Conclusion Quenching steel is an essential technique in the heat treatment process, enabling manufacturers to achieve desired mechanical properties in their steel components. The choice of quenching medium, heating methods, and attention to detail plays a significant role in the success of the process, ultimately impacting the material's hardness, ductility, and other essential properties. By following this step-by-step guide, you can ensure an efficient and successful quenching process, producing steel components with optimal material characteristics for a wide range of applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Philadelphia: During the last decade, Philadelphia experienced a large shift in its age profile. In 2000, the city's population pyramid had a largely stationary shape. In 2013, the city took on an expansive pyramid shape, with an increase in the three millennial age groups, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34. The city's 25- to 29-year-old age group was the city's largest age cohort. According to the 2010 Census, 343,837 (22.5%) were under the age of 18; 203,697 (13.3%) from 18 to 25; 434,385 (28.5%) from 25 to 44; 358,778 (23.5%) from 45 to 64; and 185,309 (12.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.5 years. For every 100 females there were 89.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.7 males. The city had 22,018 births in 2013, down from a peak 23,689 births in 2008. Philadelphia's death rate was at its lowest in at least a half-century, 13,691 deaths in 2013. Another factor attributing to the population increase is Philadelphia's immigration rate. In 2013, 12.7 percent of residents were foreign-born, just shy of the national average, 13.1 percent. How many people at the last census were under 18?","completion":"At the last census, which took place in 2010, there were 343,837 people (22.5% of the population) in Philadelphia who were under the age of 18."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I felt the rush of air against my face as the crowbar skimmed my head. The man wielding it was in a black three-piece suit and built like a Texas linebacker. His mass seemed to bend space-time in the parking lot as he barreled down on me. All I could see was nearly seven feet of Armani silk. I stood upright and brought my knee into his groin and gave him a swift elbow in the small of his back and a fist to the base of his skull.

Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, \\"I hope that helps a bit.\\" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did.

(CNN) -- Mark McGwire deserves a ban from baseball more than any sympathy. It is sad to hear his quavery confession of a career filled with steroids, his sorrow over the pain it caused his family and fans, his revelation of a life of lies that burned inside him like a hidden disease and consumed the game he loved. But for those of us who also love baseball, the damage he did was too deep and his further threat to the integrity of the game is too great to justify his return. McGwire's entire playing career is indelibly stained and his judgment is not to be trusted. What else are we to make of a man who cheated and didn't come clean for 20 years? Can he be trusted to coach other players who may be using steroids? Is he fit for any job that is also a test of character and personal standards? Baseball should bar him from coaching and never again allow his name on a Hall of Fame ballot. St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, McGwire's longtime apologist, is leading the charge to rehabilitate him in his new role as the Cardinals' batting coach, saying Monday's admission and expression of regret is worthy of respect. This from a manager who either closed his eyes to drug use on his teams, didn't know what he should have known, or kept conspiratorially silent about it through all the years with McGwire on the Oakland Athletics (along with Jose Canseco) and on the Cards. 1.

Summarize the following: Car seats are tested for their performance in crashes, and various safety organizations publish the results. These organizations and safety ratings vary by country; Australia, for example, has some of the strictest safety ratings for car seats. In Canada, Transport Canada publishes information about car seats. In the United States, consult Consumer Reports or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for information about safety ratings. Additional information can also be found at the National Child Passenger Safety Board’s website. If a particular car seat has defects in it, its manufacturer may have issued a recall. The car seat would then be returned to the manufacturer for a new seat or a refund. When you are looking into different car seats and brands, check to see if there have been any recalls on the particular car seat model or the brand itself. Search online for “car seat recall” to find the most up-to-date information. All car seats have basic features that will ensure a solid level of safety and comfort for your infant. Many car seats do, however, have additional features. These might include additional side-impact cushioning, extra padding all around the seat, or an anti-rebound bar at the foot of the car seat. At the end of a major crash, during the rebound, the car seat might bounce up and hit the seat in front of it. The anti-rebound bar, available in newer seats, is intended to minimize the impact that the car seat will take. There should be one strap per limb: one for each upper arm and one for each thigh, as well as one for the area between the child's legs. There are alternative restraint systems, such as plastic shields and T-bar restraints, but the strap system is more customizable, which can make the seat more comfortable for your child’s size. Starting in 2002, all infant car seats were required to be compatible with the LATCH system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children. The LATCH system allows infant car seats to attach directly into a car seat rather than being held in place by the seatbelt. Hooking up directly into a car seat will maximize the safety of your child in your vehicle. The LATCH system is compatible with or known by different names in other countries. In Canada, the system is called the Universal Attachment System (UAS). In Europe, the system is called ISOFIX, and ISOFIX compatible in Australia. As car seats are used, their materials deteriorate and can become less reliable. Car seat manufacturers imprint their seats with expiration dates, typically 6 years after the date of manufacture. This date can usually be found imprinted into the plastic on the back or bottom of a car seat. Ensure that the car seat has not been in a crash; this might compromise the integrity of the seat and its materials. If the seat is older than 6 years, it is not recommended for use. Summary:","completion":"Car seats are tested for crash performance with results published by various safety organizations, which differ by country.

She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \\"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\\" At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years. The counseling staff set up a special program and group for new arrivals in response, said Marcy Miller, the school's director of student services. Counseling staff members also have started small study groups for students to prepare for state Standards of Learning exams, which Miller said have helped raise test scores. She said that some of the newest counselors have had some of the freshest ideas. Question: Which of the following is the most suitable title for this passage?

A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes. Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females swim to land. They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown. When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers. When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs. The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles!

They soon meet their new boss, Cameron Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), a slick businessman who died falling from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. He outfits them with color-coordinated smartphones and treats them to luxurious accommodations â teaching them, as Roxy (Jasmine Guy) puts it later, that \\"nothing we do here matters\\". This tutelage leads the reapers to perform such misdeeds as saving those they were to Reap (Roxy), abusing immortality for financial gain (Mason, played by Callum Blue), letting a soul wander, instead of showing him \\"his lights\\" (Daisy, now played by Sarah Wynter), and otherwise selfishly focusing on their wants.[2] Georgia \\"George\\" Lass (Ellen Muth), the movie's narrator, is fired from Happy Time (a temp agency) after she loudly chews out an employee for delivering a report late. The employee quits and later sues for harassment. George ends up admitting her identity to her sister Reggie (Britt McKillip).

His ashes are then shot into orbit along with those of Murray, the cat belonging to George's boss Delores.[2] At the launch, Delores tells George that the employee who had sued her for harassment had done so at several of the employee's previous jobs, and George is reinstated, now with a corner office.

Recurrent non-random genomic alterations are the hallmarks of cancer and the characterization of these imbalances is critical to our understanding of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.', 'We performed array-comparative genomic hybridization (A-CGH) on cDNA microarrays containing 42,000 elements in neuroblastoma (NB). We found that only two chromosomes (2p and 12q) had gene amplifications and all were in the MYCN amplified samples. There were 6 independent non-contiguous amplicons (10.4-69.4 Mb) on chromosome 2, and the largest contiguous region was 1.7 Mb bounded by NAG and an EST (clone: 757451); the smallest region was 27 Kb including an EST (clone: 241343), NCYM, and MYCN. Using a probabilistic approach to identify single copy number changes, we systemically investigated the genomic alterations occurring in Stage 1 and Stage 4 NBs with and without MYCN amplification (stage 1-, 4-, and 4+). We have not found genomic alterations universally present in all (100%) three subgroups of NBs. However we identified both common and unique patterns of genomic imbalance in NB including gain of 7q32, 17q21, 17q23-24 and loss of 3p21 were common to all three categories. Finally we confirm that the most frequent specific changes in Stage 4+ tumors were the loss of 1p36 with gain of 2p24-25 and they had fewer genomic alterations compared to either stage 1 or 4-, indicating that for this subgroup of poor risk NB requires a smaller number of genomic changes are required to develop the malignant phenotype.

The activity of floating down a river on inter-tubes is generally recognized as a recreational activity undertaken for enjoyment and leisure. However, it is important to consider various aspects and motivations behind Taylor's decision to partake in this activity to provide a more comprehensive response. 1. Social Interaction: Participating in group activities with friends is a way to strengthen and maintain relationships. By engaging in a shared experience like river-floating, Taylor can create lasting memories and bond with their friends. 2. Adventure and thrill-seeking: Floating down a river on inter-tubes can offer a sense of adventure and excitement. The activity may involve navigating through rapids or simply drifting along calm waters. Either way, it can provide an adrenaline rush and satisfy thrill-seeking desires. 3. Relaxation: Taking time away from daily routines and responsibilities can be essential for mental health and well-being. Floating down a river on inter-tubes allows Taylor to relax, unwind, and recharge, alleviating stress in the process. 4. Nature appreciation: Engaging in outdoor activities provides an opportunity to connect with and appreciate the natural environment. By floating down the river, Taylor is immersing themselves in the beauty and tranquility of their surroundings, which can enhance their appreciation for nature and promote environmental awareness. 5. Physical activity: While floating on inter-tubes might not be the most vigorous exercise, it often involves swimming, paddling, and other moderate physical activities that can improve overall fitness and contribute to a healthy lifestyle. 6. Novelty and variety: Trying new experiences and breaking from routine can be mentally stimulating and fulfilling. If Taylor has never floated down a river before, they may be motivated by the desire to explore new experiences and enjoy the variety this activity offers. In summary, while \\"have fun\\" is a valid answer to the question of why Taylor chose to float down the river on inter-tubes with their friends, it's essential to recognize that there can be multiple factors and motivations involved.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm? Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops. Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, I need to think step-by-step and justify the steps: 1. The question asks which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm. 2. The paragraph provides information about both Gary and Joe. 3. Joe's farm has depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops. 4.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Your brain isn't a muscle, but you can treat it like one Many people focus on physical fitness, but few know that brain fitness is also something you can work on. In fact, you can exercise your brain as often as you do to your arms or legs-and the results can be positive and empowering. To improve your brain, you can't simply repeat the same exercises over and over. Just as lifting a two-pound weight will stop challenging you, so will repetitive exercises such as crosswords or Sudoku. Once you master easy exercises, you must move on to harder ones in order to push your brain-like your muscles-to a new level. The science behind brain training Scientists once believed that your mental abilities were fixed in adulthood. Since studies have shown just the opposite, millions of people around the world have adopted the new practice of brain training. The most popular of these brain training products is made by the San Francisco-based Lumosity. Lumosity's scientists with an experienced team of game designers have developed a fun,effective online brain training program that measures, tracks, and adapts to your progress, so you'll always be challenged. Promising studies on the effects of brain training In a 2013 Stanford study, a treatment group of 21 breast cancer survivors used 12 weeks of Lumosity training to work on processing speed, mental flexibility, and working memory tasks. On average, those who trained improved on tests of these abilities, compared to a group that did not train with Lumosity. There is even some evidence suggesting that Lumosity may be beneficial to normal, healthy adults. In a 2011 study by Lumosity and San Francisco State University researchers. 13 people who trained over 5 weeks improved working memory scores by 10%and attention scores by 20%. Brain training is designed to meet real-life needs The design of brain train ing is targeted at real-life benefits instead of improving game scores.

The politics of North Korea takes place within the framework of the official state philosophy, \\"Juche\\", a concept created by Hwang Jang-yop and later attributed to Kim Il-sung. The Juche theory is the belief that through self-reliance and a strong independent state, true socialism can be achieved. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? North Korea is a satellite state of the United States Select from the following. (I) Yes (II) It's impossible to say (III) No","completion":"(III) No The given sentence, \\"North Korea is a satellite state of the United States,\\" is not true based on the information provided in the paragraph. According to the paragraph, the politics of North Korea is governed by the Juche ideology, which emphasizes self-reliance and a strong, independent state as the means of achieving true socialism. A satellite state, on the other hand, typically refers to a country that is formally independent but is heavily influenced or controlled by another, more powerful state. This concept contradicts the core values of the Juche ideology, as it would involve reliance on the United States and undermine North Korea's pursuit of independence and self-reliance. Moreover, historically, North Korea has had an antagonistic relationship with the United States, and the two countries have significant ideological differences. North Korea is a one-party socialist state with a centrally planned economy, while the United States is a federal republic with a capitalist, market-oriented economic system. The two nations have been involved in several political conflicts and diplomatic crises, most notably during the Korean War and the ongoing issues regarding North Korea's nuclear program.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"Why was Shiva Nazar Ahari put in prison?\\" Answer: \\"Alleged adultery\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is incorrect. Shiva Nazar Ahari was put in prison for charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God,\\" which is a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. She is a prominent young female defender of human rights and her imprisonment is part of Iran's coordinated strategy against the women's movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is still used by many players such as Roger Federer as a powerful weapon in matches. Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net. This is the first step of the one-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. Start from the ready position and take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot. As you step forward turn your body and shoulders sideways so that they are now perpendicular to the net. All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot. By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot. Choose your grip based on the execution you want to achieve. The one-handed backhand will usually use an Eastern backhand grip to create topspin on the ball. Relax your dominant hand and use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip. Grip the racket with your dominant hand once more. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders. To achieve the Eastern backhand grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely. An alternative grip includes the Extreme Eastern or Semi-Western Backhand grip. This grip is for use by stronger, more advanced players and is good for hitting high balls but not good for hitting low balls. Another alternative grip is the Continental grip, which holds the racket at a 45 degree angle and is good for hitting slices. The Semi-Western backhand grip is a rare backhand grip that is good for hitting heavy topspin but bad for hitting flat shots and slices. The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways. Let your racket drop down as you straighten your hitting arm. At the same time step into the shot with your front foot. The drop of your racket creates the topspin on the tennis ball and is very important to your one-handed backhand. This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket as you complete this step. Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height. Let go of the racket with your non-hitting hand after your racket is down and your hitting arm is completely straight. Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. You should make contact in front of your body. Make sure your arm and the racket swing from the shoulder as a unit. This way your arm position relative to the racket does not change as you swing. The racket should come as low as your knee right before you make contact with the tennis ball. This will produce the topspin that you want on your backhand. Your upper body will rotate slightly back towards the net as you make your swing. Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact with the ball. Make sure contact is made in front of your body to enable you to maximize power and topspin. Keep the relationship between your arm and the tennis racket the same as you follow through. Continue lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, keeping your arm position the same. The relationship between your arm and racket should not change until your hand is at the same level as your head. Your non-hitting arm should extend all the way back and behind you. This arm controls how much your shoulders and upper body rotate as you follow through. Letting your non-hitting arm extend behind you limits the rotation of your upper body, helping you recover faster and stay balanced during your shot.","completion":"The one-handed backhand is a powerful yet less common shot in tennis today, used effectively by players like Roger Federer. The process to properly execute this technique is as follows: 1. Begin in the ready position facing the net, with your feet pointing towards it, and your knees bent. Hold the racket with both hands. 2. Pivot on your left foot and step forward with your right foot, turning your body and shoulders sideways, perpendicular to the net. Your weight should be on your back foot, enabling power and pace when hitting the shot. 3. Choose your grip based on the desired execution (Eastern backhand grip for topspin, Extreme Eastern/Semi-Western Backhand grip for advanced players, Continental grip for slices, or the rare Semi-Western backhand grip for heavy topspin). Use your non-hitting hand to rotate the racket to the appropriate grip and hold the racket with your dominant hand, ideally simultaneously with the pivot and shoulder turn. 4. Continue rotating your shoulders and moving your arms until the racket is all the way back and your shoulders are entirely sideways. Straighten your hitting arm while dropping the racket and stepping into the shot with your front foot. Keep your non-hitting hand on the racket and your eyes focused on the ball. 5. Release the racket with your non-hitting hand once your hitting arm is straight, and swing your arm and racket to the contact point with the ball, which should be in front of your body. Swing your arm and racket together as a unit to maintain their relative position, and bring the racket as low as your knee before contact with the ball to generate topspin. 6. Slightly rotate your upper body back towards the net as you swing, focusing on the ball as you hit it. Contact should be made in front of your body to maximize power and topspin. 7. Maintain the relationship between your arm and racket as you follow through, lifting your arm and rotating your shoulders throughout the shot. Keep this position until your hand is level with your head, and extend your non-hitting arm behind you to control your upper body rotation, ensuring balance and a faster recovery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.

He follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, when he realizes that she had been hiding vital information, Ka-kui calls for backup and she is later arrested. However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), a Chinese American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Ka-kui follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, the CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Ka-kui finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by unknown forces, Ka-kui loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters. When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov (Yuri Petrov) who explains the situation. Ka-kui goes with the FSB and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is taken by a Russian submarine to Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's younger sister Annie (Wu Chen-chun) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss, is seriously ill and Ka-kui suspects the criminal will show up soon. Unknown to Ka-kui, Tsui is hiding at the hospital and has given a nuclear warhead (disguised as a small oxygen tank) to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium. While following Annie, Ka-kui gets held up by Tsui, who claims to have a deal with Gregor. Ka-kui, after realizing he has been used by Gregor, decides to return home, but two men are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7.

I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment. I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology. I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology. The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth.

What is the last name of person that designed a cenotaph that is in front of the building that was purchased by the Texas Legislature in the 20th century? Answer the above question based on the context below: Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time. Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three. From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian. The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance. Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation. Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own. Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans. In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world. In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films.

The bill, approved by both sides of the upper house late on Thursday, is one of several measures introduced to fight violent extremism. Attorney-General George Brandis said the laws would apply in \\"very limited circumstances\\". At least 90 Australians are believed to be fighting with militant groups such as the so-called Islamic State. About half of them are thought to be dual nationals. Australia is increasingly concerned about the impact on its domestic security of those who support or fight with militants in the Middle East. Mr Brandis said on Friday: \\"Dual nationals who engage in terrorism are betraying their allegiance to this country and do not deserve to be Australian citizens,\\" he said. He told the senate it was \\"a significant piece of legislation which will enhance Australia's counterterrorism architecture\\". The laws do not allow for anyone to be left stateless. The government had amended the bill, introduced to the lower house in June, to increase its chances of surviving an expected challenge in the Australian High Court. Australian Constitutional experts had said the bill was flawed, according to ABC. But Mr Brandis said the legislation was \\"as strong as we can make it from a constitutional point of view\\". An independent senator and the Greens party had previously suggested the move could further expose Australians to attacks overseas. \\"Do we just give up, revoke their citizenship and then let them free range with their sick, twisted minds to do damage to Australians and to other innocents abroad?\\" said independent senator Nick Xenophon. Greens leader Richard Di Natale said it would be better to jail militants in Australia. \\"Ultimately we think the safest place for Australian citizens who have been convicted of violent acts, who are indeed criminals, is in custody here in Australia, not roaming the international stage,\\" he said.

The main aim of the legislation is to enhance Australia's counterterrorism efforts and address the threat posed by individuals who support or fight with militant groups in the Middle East.

Background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. Paragraph: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","completion":"The person had a lower core temperature during experiment B. Reasoning: In experiment B, the person consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during the two hours in the -30 degrees weather. The alcohol in the hard liquor caused his blood vessels to dilate and stimulated nerve endings near his skin's surface with warm blood, creating a sensation of warmth. However, this dilation of blood vessels actually made it easier for his body to lose heat to the cold external environment, resulting in a lower core body temperature during experiment B compared to experiment A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Last night I finished re-watching \\"Jane Eyre\\" (1983), the BBC mini-series adapted from Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke, as Jane Eyre, a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl, a governess at Mr. Rochester's estate, Thornfield. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words, \\"This book is amazing\\" and so it was and I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its beautiful language, refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh, the dialogs, and above all, two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen many times, 18 according to IMDb. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years. Of all these films I've only seen one, 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark, brooding characters did not just play Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class, he WAS Mr. Rochester - sardonic, vibrant, the force of nature, powerful, passionate, sexy, and tormented master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet, gentle, intelligent and strong Jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning, and quiet but firm willpower. Added on September 17, 2007: During the last two weeks, I've seen five \\"Jane Eyre\\" movies and it was a wonderful experience. There is something to admire in every adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\" even if not all of them are completely successful. This version is still my favorite \\"Jane Eyre\\" film. Choose your answer.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: Why did the group pick the color orange? Options: - Because the FBI likes it - not enough information - Because hunters wear it while hunting - Because the NRA likes it Answer:","completion":"Because hunters wear it while hunting"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Patient A has been suffering from hepatitis B all his life; patient B is recovering from hepatitis B on his own; and patient C doesn't have hepatitis B. Keith would now compare the symptoms of these patients. Which patient would more likely see yellowing of the skin, patient A or patient C?","completion":"Patient A would be more likely to experience yellowing of the skin compared to patient C. This is because patient A is suffering from hepatitis B, a viral infection that affects the liver. One of the common symptoms of hepatitis B is jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin and eyes due to a buildup of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced as a waste product of the breakdown of red blood cells. The liver plays a crucial role in processing bilirubin and excreting it from the body. When the liver is affected by hepatitis B, its ability to perform this function might be compromised, leading to a buildup of bilirubin in the bloodstream and causing the skin and eyes to take on a yellowish hue. On the other hand, patient C does not have hepatitis B, meaning their liver should be functioning normally and not have any issues with breaking down bilirubin effectively. As a result, it is unlikely that patient C would experience yellowing of the skin. It should be noted that while patient B is recovering from hepatitis B, they might still be at risk of experiencing symptoms like jaundice, although to a lesser extent as the infection clears. The extent of liver damage or any lingering symptoms would depend on the individual patient and the severity of the infection. In summary, patient A, who is suffering from hepatitis B, is more likely to see yellowing of the skin compared to patient C because of the liver's compromised ability to process bilirubin."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Now, I have a new situation: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Answer this question please: Which squirrels would most likely reproduce in smaller numbers, lighter or darker? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is likely that squirrels with lighter coats would reproduce in smaller numbers. Here's a step-by-step rationale: 1. The city where Mike lives has a cold environment and less predator-prey interaction. 2. Darker coats are more suitable for this type of environment since they provide better insulation in cold temperatures. 3. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that allow them to adapt better to their environment tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. 4. In this case, squirrels with darker coats are better adapted to the cold environment, meaning they would have a higher likelihood of survival and reproduction. 5.

No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The Handmaid's Tale debuts as ballet in Winnipeg The Handmaid's Tale, one of Margaret Atwood's most famous novels, emerges in a brand new form tonight in Winnipeg with the debut of a dance production by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. Adapting Atwood's classic novel was a longtime dream of Royal Winnipeg Ballet artistic director André Lewis and American choreographer Lila York: the pair first began discussing the project about a decade ago. \\"It's a world premiere. That means [it's] never been done, so there's incredible tension, incredible uplift at the same time backstage because we're putting it all together,\\" Lewis said Tuesday. \\"Curtain time is a tough deadline and you got to be ready by then, so everything is happening and it's exciting. That's what you live for as an artistic director, is to see the moment where it comes on stage.\\" On Wednesday night, the work — featuring the music of James MacMillan — will open the RWB's 2013-14 season. Atwood is slated to attend the opening. Published in 1985 and winner of the Governor General's Literary Award, as well as other literary honours, The Handmaid's Tale has previously been adapted for film and as an opera. Atwood's dystopian tale chronicles a future in which a powerful totalitarian regime has taken over and brutally reigns according to militaristic, selectively religious and ultra-conservative beliefs. The story follows Offred, a member of a concubine-like class of women who live solely as reproductive vessels for the society's leaders. The RWB production stars principal dancer Amanda Green as Offred and soloist Alexander Gamayunov as the Commander, the man with whom she is paired. \\"The language of ballet is a physical language. I mean, it can capture emotion and translate them or transport them to the audience in ways that no other art form can do…. It says it differently, and it can say it extremely powerfully,\\" Lewis said. \\"When you see it done physically with dancers, the incredible athleticism and artistry of dancers, it's very poignant. So certainly what I have seen of the run … we did this last week in our studio, it's very strong.\\" The Handmaid's Tale has its world premiere tonight in Winnipeg and will continue with evening performances through Saturday and a matinee for students on Sunday.","completion":"The Handmaid's Tale is a famous book by Margaret Atwood. It is now becoming a ballet in Winnipeg, where dancers will perform the story on stage. The Royal Winnipeg Ballet has turned the book into a dance production, which is a new and exciting event. This special way of telling the story uses ballet, which is a way of dancing that can show emotions and ideas very powerfully. The Handmaid's Tale ballet will have its first show tonight in Winnipeg and will have more performances throughout the week."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the word \\"voice\\" mean the same thing in \\"After the fire a still small voice. -- 1 Kings 19:12.\\" and \\"The voice of the law.\\"?","completion":"In order to determine whether the word \\"voice\\" means the same thing in these two expressions, let's analyze the context and expression in each example. Step 1: Analyze the context from \\"After the fire a still small voice. -- 1 Kings 19:12\\" This verse is from the Bible, specifically the Old Testament. In this context, the word \\"voice\\" is used to describe the way in which God communicates with the prophet Elijah. The still small voice symbolizes the gentle, delicate, and intimate nature of God's communication with humans as opposed to the loud and destructive elements such as wind, earthquake, and fire mentioned earlier in the passage. Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"The voice of the law\\" This expression is a metaphorical way to describe the authority and presence of the law. Here, \\"voice\\" represents the principles, rules, and regulations established by society and enforced by a legal system. In this context, the \\"voice\\" of the law refers to the power of legal authorities to communicate and enforce justice. Step 3: Compare and evaluate the meanings In \\"After the fire a still small voice,\\" the word \\"voice\\" refers to a delicate, intimate form of communication from God. In contrast, in \\"The voice of the law,\\" it refers to the authoritative, regulatory, and forceful nature of the law's principles and rules. Conclusion: The word \\"voice\\" does not mean the same thing in these two expressions. In the first example from 1 Kings 19:12, it represents a gentle communication from God, while in the second example, it denotes the authoritative and regulatory nature of the law. The difference lies in the context in which the word \\"voice\\" is used and the metaphorical meanings associated with each expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Martin Robinson. Strife: Michael O'Leary's Ryanair has revealed its first drop in profits for five years but maintains their customer service is improving. Ryanair has suffered its first fall in annual profits for five years but maintains its much-maligned customer service is improving 'rapidly'. The budget airline has today revealed its post-tax profits were eight per cent lower at £426.5million (523million euros) to the end of March 2014 - down around £37million on a year earlier. The slide came despite boss Michael O'Leary's promise that the company would 'stop unnecessarily. p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'. Today the chief executive described the results as disappointing but said efforts. since September to reinvent Ryanair's image and reputation helped. passenger traffic rise four per cent in the second half of the year. After years of growth the budget airline was forced to issue an unprecedented two profits warnings in the past 12 months. O'Leary also decided to offer a more 'sophisticated' experience of passengers, including ending the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5. As part of ending the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture, he also promised strict hand-luggage. restrictions would be relaxed. He also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine. mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often. results in a £70 charge to reprint them. Decline: The budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its passengers 'like the enemy' - was recently forced to issue its second profits warning in a year ahead of these disappointing results. Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a. reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for. almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary. growth. . The. airline, which operates more than 1,600 routes from 68 bases expects to fly 84.6 million passengers in the next year. Overall,. they are predicting a recovery in profits for the current year to. between £473 million and £505.6million. Over the next five years, the airline plans to grow to more. than 110 million customers a year, it said. Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. But in the past 12 months, under pressure over customer service, he has said he wants to change his ways. Over the autumn a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon. was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer. session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many. customers told Mr O'Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was - with. user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired. British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The. Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more. accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still. love me.'","completion":"Ryanair, a big airline company, had its profits go down for the first time in five years. Profits are the money a company makes after paying for everything it needs. However, the boss of the company, Michael O'Leary, said they are making their customer service better. Customer service means how a company treats and helps its customers. Ryanair is making changes, like letting people choose where to sit on the plane and being nicer when customers make mistakes. They think their profits will go up again this year, and they plan to have even more customers in the future."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a paragraph, a question and some answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", etc.) You need to list all the correct answer options with their associated letters (e.g. \\"A\\" can be a valid answer).

The sight of the bloody body of his patient clad in a bright green dress causes Capa to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red. To restart his life, Capa travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Bakula), who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session.

White county to the east experienced some rain but was sheltered from this phenomenon because of the mountain range. But I can use this background: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes.

Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, and boyfriend Robert Palmer, 37, was were arrested march after the fire department in Green Township responded to a call about two unresponsive adults. Jeffers was sentenced to six months in jail, with 90 days suspended and given credit for 44 days served only one week after Palmer received a similar punishment, according to WXIX. Jailed: Tamica Jeffers, 33, stands Monday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court with her attorney John Waggal, left, as she is sentenced to six months in jail. Robert Paul Palmer, 37, and Tamica Lynn Jeffers, 33, of Dillsboro, Indiana were arrested last month after shooting up at an Ohio McDonald's. Both have been sentenced to 6 months in jail. Authorities said Jeffers was unconscious and not breathing, and Palmer was conscious but unresponsive. They eventually recovered from what police say were 'life-threatening overdoses' of heroin. Authorities say the couple admitted taking the drugs while with a five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy they had brought to the play area. Attorney Michael J. Trapp said Palmer hopes to serve his time and then begin picking up the pieces of his life. 'My client is very sorry that this happened,' Trapp said after the sentencing. Prosecutors said in court he showed little appreciation for the seriousness of his actions. He will get credit for time served since his arrest, meaning he has a little less than five months left in jail, but it is not known if he had the last half of his sentence suspended similar to Jeffers'. Multiple MailOnline attempts to reach local authorities for clarification were not successful. After the overdoses, the McDonald's franchise owner and operator in suburban Green Township said he was proud that the restaurant crew and its customers took quick action to respond to the emergency and call 911 for medical help for the couple.

Movie title: Too Late for Tears Movie plot: Don DeFore and Lizabeth Scott Jane and Alan Palmer (Scott and Kennedy) are driving to a party in the Hollywood Hills one evening when someone in another car throws a suitcase into the back seat of their convertible. They open it and discover packs of cash. They are chased by yet another car for a short time but get away. Back at their upper-middle-class Hollywood apartment, they examine the cash. Jane wants to keep the money, but Alan wants to take it to the police. Alan places the suitcase and cash in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. She and Alan plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money.

Do I expect algorithms and Big Oh complexity questions for a firmware job? In companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. what is the highest position where programming is still a big part of one's job? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To answer your first question, preparing for a firmware or embedded engineer position at Google involves several steps, including acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge, polishing your problem-solving abilities, and having a strong understanding of algorithms and Big Oh complexity. Although the focus may lie more on embedded systems, you should expect questions related to algorithms and Big Oh complexity during the interview process. Here are the steps to prepare for a firmware or embedded engineer position at Google: 1. Acquire the necessary skills and knowledge: - Gain proficiency in embedded languages like C, C++, Python, and Assembly. - Learn about embedded systems, microcontrollers, memory management, and sensor interfacing. - Understand low-power design principles, real-time operation systems (RTOS), and debugging techniques. - Get familiar with networking protocols, communication interfaces, and scripting languages. - Gain exposure to hardware schematics and datasheets for component selection and integration. 2. Open-source contributions and personal projects: - Contribute to open-source projects related to embedded systems or firmware. - Work on personal projects and create a portfolio to showcase your skills during the interview process. 3. Algorithm and data structure knowledge: - Google may include questions related to algorithms and Big Oh complexity in the interview. Therefore, study common algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming. 4. Prepare for behavioral questions: - Google emphasizes cultural fit and values technical individuals who can work collaboratively. Familiarize yourself with the company culture and values, and be prepared to share examples of how you have demonstrated those qualities in your past experiences. 5. Networking: - Connect with professionals working in the industry to gain insights into the job's requirements and keep up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. 6. Practice interview questions: - Research typical embedded engineer interview questions and practice answering them. Websites like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Glassdoor can be beneficial for this purpose. Regarding your second question, in large companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon, the highest position where programming is still a significant part of one's job usually lies within the senior software engineer or principal engineer levels. These engineers are responsible for designing, implementing, and enhancing complex software systems while maintaining their hands-on coding and reviews. Although these roles may involve management and leadership responsibilities, they continue to play a vital role in technical decision-making and collaborating with the teams on core development tasks. Lastly, the two questions you posed are not paraphrases of each other. The first question is about preparing for a firmware or embedded engineer position at Google and whether to expect Big Oh complexity questions. In contrast, the second question is about the highest position in large companies where programming remains a significant part of the job.

But that's where the similarities end. The film stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara as the couple - we never learn their names - at the heart of this poetic meditation on grief, memory, time and existence. When Affleck's character dies in a car accident his ghost returns home to console his grieving partner. Ahead of its release in the UK, we talked to director David Lowery about how he made his film so haunting. \\"I've always loved that image,\\" says Lowery, whose previous films include Ain't Them Bodies Saints - also with Affleck and Mara - and Disney's Pete's Dragon. \\"On our phones the emoji for ghost is a person in a sheet. We understand that to mean a soul who is not able to move on. It's a very heavy concept represented by the most child-like image. \\"At one point I had the idea of making a straightforward horror film like Poltergeist, but with the ghost represented by a guy in a sheet. But now I've used it in this movie so I can't do that any more.\\" \\"It was trial and error to be honest,\\" he admits. \\"It is a goofy image and we embraced it. There was a version of the movie that had a lot more slapstick, where the ghost was more comical. But as we were shooting it we realised more and more that just didn't work. \\"Even something as simple as the ghost walking from one room to the next had the potential for comedy. It looked silly. \\"We had to figure out a way to make it not funny. A lot of it was the costume design. It was very complex. We shot the ghost at a different frame rate so that the movement felt spookier and more ethereal.\\" The costume, designed and built by Annell Brodeur, incorporated several layers of petticoats and a helmet designed to keep the actor's face aligned with the eyeholes. \\"You think it's going to be an easy concept just to put a sheet over someone's head, but it was so complicated,\\" adds Lowery. \\"When the ghost looks over his shoulder we had to have everybody down on the ground holding the sheet in place so the folds wouldn't move in the wrong direction.\\" The scene which has got everyone talking is where Rooney Mara's grieving character devours a chocolate pie in a static shot lasting several minutes. \\"I knew that I wanted there to be a moment where you feel her grief that was off the beaten path,\\" says Lowery. \\"We have a scene of her crying in bed and it would have been easy to do another scene like that. But I felt there was a better way to do it. \\"I thought about times when I'm upset that I take solace in food. I think a lot of people do.\\" Mara told Lowery before we shot it she'd never eaten pie in her life. She's also vegan, so it wasn't any old chocolate pie. \\"I knew it was asking a lot of her but she went for it - and it's probably the scene I'm proudest of in my career,\\" says Lowery. \\"It's a scene I knew people would talk about. Everyone goes to this movie knowing Rooney's going to eat a pie.\\" The film opens with the couple arguing about whether to leave their Texas ranch home. Lowery explains it was based on an argument he has with his wife over whether they should move to Los Angeles from their home in Texas. \\"I'm a sentimental person and I like to stay in once place and put down roots. I get very attached to the homes I live in. And she's the opposite, she likes to keep moving. \\"We had an argument that felt like a scene from the movie - I even said so at the time. It was only a month or two after that the idea for this film came into being.\\" Lowery turned his idea into a 30-page script within a matter of days. \\"It was very surreal to watch Rooney and Casey act that scene when we filmed it,\\" he recalls. \\"My wife was on set that day and I remember her looking at me and rolling her eyes.\\" Lowery chose to film using an almost square aspect ratio and softened the edges of the frame. \\"I've wanted to employ it for a while and this felt like the perfect opportunity to do it. It felt like an experimental film already,\\" he explains. \\"Adding those vignettes on the corners was a way for me to see the film as an object. It imposes a window on the film, you're always looking though something to the image. \\"It helped me understand the movie better and it also added the slightest hint of nostalgia. It has the look of a slide projector image on a wall.\\" A Ghost Story is out in the UK on 11 August Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The flag of the United States is sometimes burned in protest of the policies of the American government, both within the country and abroad. The United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipality) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as \`\`symbolic speech.'' However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression. And if the flag that was burned was someone else's property (as it was in the Johnson case, as Johnson had stolen the flag from a Texas bank's flagpole), they could be charged with petty larceny (a flag usually sells at retail for less than USD 20), or with destruction of private property, or possibly both. What's the best answer to this question: is it illegal to stand on a flag?","completion":"No, it isn't illegal to stand on a flag in the United States. Just like how some people might burn the flag to express their feelings or point of view, some people might stand on it too. This is considered \\"symbolic speech,\\" which means you're using actions instead of words to share your thoughts. The big judges in America, called the Supreme Court, said this is okay because of something important called the First Amendment. But remember, even if it's not illegal, it might make some people very unhappy because they see the flag as a special symbol of our country. And if the flag you're standing on belongs to someone else and you took it without asking, then you could get in trouble because that's like stealing or breaking something that's not yours."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the lead role, he tries to cast the feared film star Sabina Quarles, who has a reputation of being hard to work with. She initially declines, explaining she is too good for television. However, because of her past with Mel, she finally accepts the role. They soon start a relationship, but he remains suspicious of her constant visits to San Francisco. She is reluctant to explain why she is going there every month, which makes him think she has an affair. Meanwhile, playing her stepson in the series is Bill Warwick, an actor who is a sex symbol. He is married to Sandy, but because of his image, he has to keep their marriage a secret. Sandy was once a great actress, but her drug addiction has turned her into a street prostitute, ignoring her work.

The absolute difference is the absolute value of one integer subtracted by another. The output should be a single integer which is the smallest possible absolute distance. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [-52, -56, 20, -31] Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the problem. The task is to find the smallest absolute difference between any two integers in the given list. Here's a simple step-by-step explanation of how to solve this problem: 1. Sort the list of integers: [-56, -52, -31, 20] 2. Initialize a variable 'min_difference' to a large value (like infinity or the maximum integer value). 3. Iterate through the sorted list, and for each consecutive pair of integers, calculate their absolute difference. 4. If the calculated absolute difference is smaller than the 'min_difference', update the 'min_difference' with the current absolute difference. 5. Once the iteration is over, the 'min_difference' will store the smallest absolute difference between any two integers in the list. Now, let's solve the given instance: Input list: [-52, -56, 20, -31] 1. Sort the list: [-56, -52, -31, 20] 2. Initialize 'min_difference' to a large value (e.g., infinity): min_difference = infinity 3. Iterate through the sorted list and calculate absolute differences: - |-56 - (-52)| = 4; min_difference = min(infinity, 4) = 4 - |-52 - (-31)| = 21; min_difference = min(4, 21) = 4 - |-31 - 20| = 51; min_difference = min(4, 51) = 4 4.

Kasliwal's sculpture is 20 feet long and about 6 feet, 6 inches wide.

Transistors are a key component to many different types of electronic devices, including radios.

In the context of radios, transistors are essential to enable the transmission and reception of signals, including reaching a base station. For example, in walkie-talkies, truck radios, or ham radios that people might use in field operations, transistors play a crucial role. It's important to note that the term 'transistor radio' is often used to refer to portable radios that people used before the era of smartphones and internet radios. They were quite common in the mid-20th century. But essentially, any modern radio device would still use transistors in its circuitry.

Question: Why does the killer disconnect the phone lines? Movie title: Deliria Movie plot: Late at night inside a theater, a troupe of actors are rehearsing a musical about a mass murderer known as the Night Owl. When the show's leading lady Alicia sprains her ankle, she and the wardrobe mistress Betty sneaks out of the rehearsal for medical assistance in which the closest medical facility is a mental hospital. When speaking to the psychiatrist, Betty notices a imprisoned patient who is revealed to be Irving Wallace, a former actor who went insane and committed a killing spree. Unbeknownst to any of them, Wallace killed one of the attendants with a syringe and sneaked out of the asylum, hiding in the back of Betty's car. Once they arrive back at the theater, the director Peter fires Betty for leaving during rehearsal. As she packs her things and gets ready to leave, Betty returns to the car only for Wallace to murder her with a pickaxe. Moments later, Alicia then emerges from the theater upon the discovery of her friend's corpse. Later, police officers arrive to remove the scene and stations two officers in the parking lot to keep an eye on the premises.Meanwhile, the director creates an idea by altering the play's script; he renames the show's antagonist to Irving Wallace instead of an ambiguous killer, and insists that everyone stay the night to begin immediate rehearsals with the new material, resulting one of his actresses Corinne hide the theater's key so nobody can leave. With the promise of additional cash, the group reluctantly agrees. Inside the dressing room, Laurel feels someone's inside and locks the door; she then screams when someone tries opening it and calls the group to her assistance. Peter accuses Brett as the culprit, but he refuses to accept.Unbeknownst to the group, Wallace himself has donned the theater's owl costume.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant.

Over the winter the bank replaced their dirty carpet with hardwood to satisfy their customers, the Select from: (a). carpet was old.

The shabby, worn-out carpet had seen better days - it was a tired remnant of the bank's past, desperately gasping for a fresh start. The familiar sound of footsteps making their way across the bank's floor buzzed with quiet frustration and dissatisfaction from their loyal clientele. The bank's management, finally succumbing to the increasing patrons' complaints, initiated the process of revitalization. They identified a reputable hardwood supplier, sourced the finest quality planks, and scheduled the renovation to take place after banking hours. The hours passed, and renovations accelerated as planned. The workers carefully pulled up the ratty carpet, exposing the underlying cement floor. The contractors meticulously measured and cut each hardwood plank, acutely aware of the importance of the details in a financial institution. The bank's management watched with cautious optimism, both excited and nervous about the transformation at hand. And then, the morning sun spilled into the bank through the grand windows, illuminating the spectacular transformation. The once dull and grimy space had metamorphosed into an elegant, sophisticated interior. Rich, chocolate-brown hardwood floors stretched throughout the bank, reflecting a warm and welcoming light. As the customers entered the bank that day, they found themselves in a world reborn. Instead of the frayed and stained carpet, they were greeted by pristine hardwood underfoot. The ambiance breathed new life, with the smart and contemporary design inspiring a renewed confidence in the bank's services. The bank employees, invigorated and motivated by their updated workspace, served customers with newfound enthusiasm. The tellers greeted customers with warm smiles, while loan officers shuffled through paperwork with great pride. The clientele responded in kind - the atmosphere was charged with a positive energy where loyalties were strengthened, and connections renewed. Over time, as the hardwood floors began to show signs of wear, the bank found itself reluctant to replace them. They recognized the unique and endearing charm that accompanied the subtle marks of age. These scrapes and scuffs served as tangible memories, embedding the successes and setbacks of the bank within the very fabric of its foundation. Years later, customers could still walk into the bank, trace their fingers along the grooves and scuffs in the hardwood, and reminisce about the days when the old carpet had dominated their environment. The bank had garnered recognition and admiration for its rich history and dedication to serving its loyal patrons. By replacing the old, dirty carpet with hardwood floors, the bank not only changed the aesthetic of the building but also fostered a culture of growth and evolution. This decision cemented a legacy that would persist for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As the largest city in the country, Zurich is home to several major Swiss banks, financial institutions, and insurance companies, contributing significantly to the city's economic growth and success. Nestled on the northwestern shore of Lake Zurich, the city comprises a population of approximately 430,000 people, and the metropolitan area covers a vast area of 1,700 km². One of the primary reasons Zurich is considered the financial center of Switzerland is due to the presence and influence of some of the world's leading financial institutions, such as Credit Suisse and UBS, both of which have their headquarters in the city. Additionally, numerous other international banks operate branches and offices in Zurich, making it a global financial hub. Zurich's economy is predominantly driven by the finance and services sectors. This prosperity is reflected in the high standard of living enjoyed by its residents, which consistently ranks among the highest in the world. Zurich has also been acknowledged as one of the world's most liveable cities, partly due to its clean air, efficient public transportation system, and vibrant cultural scene. Besides finance, Zurich is also a significant hub for technological and scientific industries, with numerous multinational corporations, research centers, and innovative start-ups operating within the city. Well-known tech companies, such as Google and IBM, have established their Swiss headquarters in Zurich, further cementing the city's reputation as a leading economic powerhouse. The Swiss Stock Exchange, also known as the SIX Swiss Exchange, has its main trading floor in Zurich, making it a pivotal center for securities trading in Europe. Due to Switzerland's unique political system and strong privacy laws, the country has historically drawn affluent individuals and multinational corporations seeking financial stability, and Zurich has been the primary beneficiary.

With Di Maria's future at the Bernabeu uncertain, both Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are showing keen interest in acquiring the talented Argentine winger. Manchester United, managed by Louis van Gaal, are very eager to strengthen their squad after a disappointing season and believe that Di Maria can bring the much-needed quality and creativity to the team. United are expected to face fierce competition from PSG, who have a strong financial backing and are willing to secure a loan deal for Di Maria before committing to a permanent move next year. Additionally, PSG's potential loan deal could also work in their favor as they navigate through the Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. However, Manchester United, known for their financial muscle, are still hoping to lure Di Maria with a lucrative contract offer and the prospect of playing in the English Premier League. While Manchester United are seriously considering the possibility of signing Di Maria, they will need to move quickly and decisively to fend off PSG's pursuit.

News article: FBI investigates if terror group arranged California killers’ marriage The FBI is investigating whether the online courtship of the future San Bernardino mass murderers was a match made in hell by a terror group — to set in motion the radicalized duo’s evil plan, director James Comey said on Wednesday. Comey told a Senate Judiciary Committee that investigators do not yet know if a group like ISIS hatched the love-and-hate match between jihadists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. In response to a question by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether their marriage was “arranged by a terrorist organization, Comey said: “I don’t know the answer to that yet.” “Do you agree with me that if it was arranged by a terrorist operative of an organization that is a game-changer?” Graham said. “It would be a very, very important thing to know,” Comey responded about the possibility that a terror group arranged a marriage and infiltrated the US using the K-1 fiancee visa system. “That’s why we’re working so hard to understand it,” he said. The top G-man also said that Farook, 28, and Malik, 29, were radicalized at least two years ago and planned their evil martyrdom scheme long before they were engaged and before she applied for her visa. The couple — who lived in a two-bedroom townhouse with their 6-month-old daughter and Farook’s mother — killed 14 people and wounded 21 during a holiday party Dec. 2 at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. They were killed about four hours later in a shootout with police. The FBI had previously said only that the two had been radicalized for “quite some time.” Malik, who lived most of her life in Saudi Arabia, moved from Pakistan to the US in July 2014. She married Farook on Aug. 16, 2014, in Riverside, Calif. He was born in Chicago in 1987 and raised in Southern California. “San Bernardino involved two killers who were radicalized for quite a long time before their attack,” Comey said about the couple. “Our investigation to date shows that they were radicalized before they started courting or dating each other online, and as early as the end of 2013, were talking to each other about jihad and martyrdom before they became engaged and married and were living in the US,” he said. “We also believe they were inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. We’re working very to understand exactly their association and the source of their inspiration,” he said. “We’re working very, very hard to understand whether they had other plans — either for that day or earlier.” A US government source familiar with the shooting probe said Farook may have been plotting an attack in the US as early as 2011, Reuters reported. Comey also said his agents are “still sorting out” whether ISIS, which declared the duo its “soldiers,” masterminded the San Bernardino attack – but added that his agency still believes they self-radicalized. He confirmed that Malik posted a “bayat,” or pledge of allegiance, to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the day of the attack. “ISIL has embraced them. … So ISIL’s inspiration may well have been part of this,” he said, using another acronym for the group. Under questioning, Comey also said he “doesn’t have reason to believe” that ISIS has already set up terrorist cells in the US. “They are trying to do two things,” he said. “They are trying to motivate people already in the United States to become killers on their behalf. They would very much like to as they aspire to be the leader in the global jihad [and] send people here to conduct attacks. It’s that second piece that we have not seen yet.” He also declined to say what role, if any, encrypted communications played in last week’s massacre. Comey said he remained concerned that terrorists and others were using technology to evade detection. “Increasingly, we are unable to see what they say, which gives them a tremendous advantage,” he said. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Ioway) said Malik may have provided an incorrect address in Pakistan on her visa application to hide her family’s ties to radical Islamists in the Punjab area, the LA Times reported. “This is yet another example of the failure of the screening process for those entering the United States,” said Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Our government apparently didn’t catch the false address in Pakistan she listed on her application or other possible signs that she was radicalized or an operative.” Two government sources told the paper that Malik apparently used the name of a neighborhood or street near her home in Pakistan. But others who have seen the visa application think she might have provided the erroneous information either to avoid getting exposed because of her relatives’ ties to militant groups or because she was confused by the application form, the LA Times reported.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25.

Step 1: Analyze each option's effectiveness in keeping the pizza warm. Option 1: Putting the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer - The seat warmer will transmit heat directly to the box, which will then be retained by the pizza, maintaining its warm temperature. Option 2: Turning all of the car's heaters on full blast with windows down - Since the heaters will be blowing hot air into the car and the windows being down will allow for cold air from outside to enter, there will be a mix of both hot and cold air. This might not be as effective in keeping the pizza warm, as the hot air is not in direct contact with the pizza box. Step 2: Evaluate both options' energy efficiency. Option 1: Using the seat heater only consumes energy for heating the seat itself, reducing overall energy usage. Option 2: Blasting the car's heaters at full power with windows down is less efficient, as it creates unnecessary energy waste. Air conditioners usually consume a significant amount of energy, and having the windows down would require the heaters to work even harder to maintain desired temperatures. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, putting the pizza box on top of a seat with a seat warmer (Option 1) is a better solution to keep the pizza warm during the drive. This option is both more effective in retaining warmth and promotes energy efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The strength of acids and bases is determined by the concentration of ions they produce when dissolved in water. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. It is measured by pH. A neutral substance has a pH of 7. An acid has a pH lower than 7, and a base has a pH greater than 7. Q: The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called? A: OPT: (1). alkalinity (2). alcohol (3). moisture (4). acidity A:","completion":"The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. Acidity is a measure of how acidic a solution is, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of acids and bases. When a substance is dissolved in water, it can release hydrogen ions (H+), which contribute to the acidity of the solution. The concentration of these hydrogen ions determines the pH of the solution, which is a numerical value used to express the level of acidity or alkalinity. A neutral substance, such as pure water, has a pH of 7, meaning that the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to that of hydroxide ions (OH-) in the solution. Substances with a pH lower than 7 are considered acidic, and substances with a pH greater than 7 are considered basic or alkaline. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with values below 7 indicating acidity and values above 7 indicating alkalinity. The scale is logarithmic, meaning that each whole number change in pH represents a tenfold change in the concentration of hydrogen ions. For example, a solution with a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 4, and 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. In the given options, (1) alkalinity denotes the opposite of acidity and refers to the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution, (2) alcohol is an organic compound characterized by the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH), and (3) moisture refers to the presence of water in a substance, particularly as a trace amount. Thus, the correct answer to the question, \\"The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called?\\" is (4) acidity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him. At first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta... Answer:","completion":"How does the arrival of Professor Knowby's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, impact Ash's fight against the demonic forces in the cabin, and do they manage to find a way to stop the Evil Force using the additional pages from the Necronomicon that they brought back from the archaeological dig?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Turkish Jets Strike Kurdish Rebels The Turks contend that at least 150 P.K.K. fighters were killed in the two earlier raids this month, at least one of which was backed up by shelling by ground forces. However, Kurdish leaders say casualties totaled only a handful, including several civilians. Americans officials in Baghdad declined Wednesday to comment on the disparities in casualty counts. An American military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Kevin J. Bergner, said that efforts were being made to get accurate information, a difficult process. “We don’t have forces there that are the arbiters of the ground truth,” General Bergner said. “The military unit conducting the operation is the Turkish forces, and they are, in this case, the arbiters of ground truth.” The United States is in a delicate situation because Turkey is a crucial American ally. But the United States does not want to strain relations with the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq and the Iraqi government, which have objected to the Turkish attacks. The P.K.K., which has sought an autonomous state in Turkey’s predominantly Kurdish southeast since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Philip T. Reeker, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Baghdad, reiterated the American position on the Turkish military operation. “We made clear, of course, that we would be concerned about anything that leads to civilian casualties or destabilization in northern Iraq,” Mr. Reeker said. “So we will continue to watch the situation closely. And the U.S., Iraq and Turkey continue to have common interests in seeing that the activities of the P.K.K. are ended.” According to Turkish media reports here, the locations attacked by the Turkish military were empty because the rebels retreated deeper into Iraqi territory in anticipation of the raids. “More than the mathematical results, the psychological results are important in this war of propaganda,” said Ali Nihat Ozcan, a political analyst based in Ankara. “There is an improvement in Turkish-American relations, which sends a strong message to the P.K.K. and, on the other hand, pleases and relaxes the Turkish public opinion.” At least three Kurdish political parties have been disbanded by Turkey’s Constitutional Court since the 1990s, mainly on charges of inciting ethnic separation in the country, which has around 15 million Kurds. This year, the public prosecutor brought a motion before the Constitutional Court to disband the Democratic Society Party, accusing it of being the P.K.K.’s political wing. The party’s chairman, Nurettin Demirtas, was recently arrested and is being kept in military jail on charges of forging a medical report to avoid mandatory service with the Turkish military. The P.K.K., which is estimated to have about 3,500 rebels active in the Iraqi mountains, has threatened retaliation against the Turkish military on some Kurdish Web sites. “Maybe during winter an appropriate response is not possible,” a commander in the mountains was quoted as saying by the Firat News Agency on Monday. “But they shouldn’t forget that when leaves turn green, the dreams that the Turkish state has been dreaming will turn into a nightmare.” In Istanbul, seven people were injured Tuesday when a bomb placed in a garbage bin exploded, the police said. No organization has yet claimed responsibility. On Monday, about 7.5 pounds of explosives were found in an abandoned bag in Sisli, a busy Istanbul district. The police said they caught the owner of the bag, a young man, but no further information had been made public. Damien Cave contributed reporting from Baghdad.

Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative? The last time I was here was in December. I thought the food was spectacular. Today, three months later, not so much. Had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag. Asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy. There is another local restaurant that does this for me. Well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless. I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy. So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous. The basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush. The chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough. However, it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices. Everything was freshly made that has to be said. The waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the \\"sambar?\\"when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food) It was lentils in a tomato base. Really good. The waitress was very polite, attentive and just an overall nice young lady. I am so disappointed in the food this time around though.

Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: When did the author appreciate having to shovel snow?

Dracula refuses to help, and transforms Mamuwalde into a vampire, whom he names Blacula and imprisons in a sealed coffin. Mamuwalde's wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee), is also imprisoned and dies in captivity. In 1972, the coffin has been purchased as part of an estate by two interior decorators, Bobby McCoy (Ted Harris) and Billy Schaffer (Rick Metzler) and shipped to Los Angeles.

He understands that extra hours of training and practice under the guidance of his experienced tutor, Benjamin, would be highly beneficial for improving his competency. This is because the aviation industry demands a high level of precision, and the need to adhere to strict protocols and standards which leave no room for error. Asking Benjamin for additional hours likely stems from Jason's awareness of his own weaknesses, strengths, and learning progress. In identifying the areas where he needs further assistance, he can focus on refining his skills and acquiring valuable knowledge specific to those areas, ensuring that he becomes a competent and safe pilot. Moreover, working closely with Benjamin allows Jason to receive personalized feedback, tailored guidance, and expert advice, which can considerably enhance his learning experience. This kind of focused, one-on-one training optimizes Jason's development and growth, ultimately improving his chances of becoming a successful pilot. The fact that Benjamin is an experienced tutor is also an important aspect to consider. As an expert in the field, Benjamin brings invaluable insight, advice, and mentorship to Jason's journey and can effectively evaluate his progress and readiness. By seeking extra hours, Jason is not only acknowledging his unpreparedness but also taking proactive responsibility in addressing it. In conclusion, Jason's request for extra training hours from Benjamin (Option 1) is an appropriate choice as it accurately acknowledges and addresses his current unpreparedness. It highlights his commitment to personal development and growth, while also recognizing the critical role that Benjamin plays in his progress towards achieving his dream of becoming a pilot."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Given the context: How would Tracy feel afterwards? Options: [A]. wasteful. [B]. silly. [C]. environmentally conscious. The answer is:","completion":"C. environmentally conscious. Tracy's decision to drive less shows their awareness of the environmental impact of their actions, particularly in relation to carbon emissions and fossil fuel usage associated with driving. It demonstrates that they are actively seeking ways to minimize their negative impact on the environment. Choosing to drive less can lead to numerous environmental benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased air pollution, and lower dependence on non-renewable resources. By taking this step, Tracy's actions align with the values of environmental consciousness, working positively towards a more sustainable future. This shows that they are taking responsibility for their environmental footprint and are likely to be mindful of other aspects of their life that involve their impact on the environment. After making this change, Tracy is expected to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from contributing to the global efforts to fight climate change and protect the environment. They might feel inspired to continue exploring eco-friendly habits and developing an even more sustainable lifestyle. Moreover, Tracy's decision to drive less can have additional benefits beyond the environmental impact. For example, they might choose to walk, cycle, or use public transport instead of driving.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: In the opening paragraph of the letter, you should immediately introduce yourself or your company and your cause – specifically. Don't beat around the bush. People need to be hooked right out of the gate. Don't assume people know who you are or what your organization does. Explain those things, clearly. Begin with a description of the company (if it's a corporate letter) or yourself (if it's for personal sponsorship). For example, such-and-such firm is a nonprofit organization committed to rehabilitation... etc. Highlighting a few accomplishments right away will make it clear why it's not a risk to give you sponsorship. Make it very clear how the money will be specifically used. In the second paragraph or first, you need to make the direct request for sponsorship and explain why you are seeking it. In order to give you sponsorship, a company or person needs to be convinced they will benefit from doing so. So in the middle paragraphs of the letter, clearly communicate the benefits – not to you, but to them. If the sponsors will get good publicity out of the sponsorship, for example, explain how. Be very specific: Will the event be televised? How many people will be attending? Will there be VIPS? If other prominent companies or their competitors are sponsoring your event, you might want to mention that. Give the sponsors options. They will like the fact they have different choices to match their individual needs or budgets. This means including a few numbers – audience size, for example, or demographics of those they will reach. Also don't forget to thread in an element of emotional appeal - a personal story of someone who will be helped, for example, if said briefly (in a sentence or two) can be very moving. Explain how you will give the sponsors recognition for their sponsorship. Perhaps they can have free booth space at your event in exchange for sponsorship. Provide the essential details of the sponsorship deal that they will need to make their decision. Don't forget to include contact information. You might want to also include a self-addressed, stamped envelope to make it easier for them to respond. Don't forget to include the date you need a response by. Ask the sponsors how they prefer to be recognized. For example, how do they want their name to appear and do they want to be recognized? Offer possibilities but never assume. Ask. You should provide some concrete details in the letter to back up your organization or event. For example, if you're writing a letter for a charity, you should explain the background of the charity, such as when it was founded, who runs it, who it serves, and any awards or accomplishments it's received. Show don't tell. Don't just tell us the group or event are good or worthy. Convince us through showing details – evidence that backs up why or how the event or group are good or worthy. Evidence is more persuasive than superlatives, generally. Just sending off a letter to a company is not the most personal way to develop a connection. Although a sponsorship letter is a good idea, follow up in a more personal manner. You could call or stop by if you don't get a response in 10 days. Remember though that many CEOS especially will be very busy and could be annoyed. So you might want to schedule an appointment or call first. Make sure that you convey excitement about your project. Avoid anything negative. You don't want to sound like you're begging or trying to put a guilt trip on them about donating.. If the answer is “maybe,” don't feel bad about following up. Just don't do it immediately or too much or you might become annoying. Never be presumptuous. Don't assume they will give you a meeting or sponsorship. Simply thank them for their consideration. Don't forget to send a thank you note if you get a sponsorship. What is a summary?","completion":"A sponsorship letter is a crucial tool in securing financial support for an organization, event, or cause. To effectively persuade potential sponsors, the letter should: 1. Introduce yourself or your company and your cause specifically, detailing the company's background, objectives, and accomplishments. 2. Clearly explain how the sponsorship funds will be used and make a direct request for sponsorship, outlining why you need the support. 3. Highlight the benefits the sponsor will obtain, such as publicity or audience reach, and be specific in terms of event attendance, media coverage, and previous sponsors. 4. Provide different sponsorship options to accommodate sponsors' needs or budgets, including relevant data and appeal to their emotions with a personal story if relevant. 5. Offer recognition for the sponsors' support and give essential details of the sponsorship deal. 6. Include contact information, response deadlines, and inquire about the sponsor's preferences for being recognized. 7. Develop a more personal connection by following up on the sponsorship letter with a call or meeting, always maintaining a professional and appreciative tone, and remembering to send a thank you note if sponsorship is granted."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Men in Black II Movie plot: Five years after the retirement of Agent K (Jones) from MIB, the secret New York City-based agency that monitors and regulates extraterrestrials residing on Earth, Agent J (Smith)âK's former partner and hand-picked replacementâis called to investigate the murder of an alien at his pizzeria. The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but it's not enough: Years before, he neuralyzed himself, specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returnedâbut as a precaution, he left himself a series of clues. At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with the worm aliens from the first movie. The key opens a locker in Grand Central Station where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card. K recovers both, to the aliens' horror, but J gives them his watch as a replacement, and becomes their new deity. At the video store, as J and K... My question: Where is K working as postmaster?

OPT: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"To answer the first question, I will do a quick research on states in Mexico where the Hindi language is spoken. Step 1: Research states in Mexico and the languages spoken in each state. Justification: To determine if any state in Mexico speaks pure Hindi, it is necessary to gather data about the languages spoken in Mexico. Result: After researching, I found out that no state in Mexico speaks pure Hindi as their main language. Spanish is the official language of Mexico, and other regional languages like Nahuatl, Yucatec Maya, and Mixtec are also spoken in various states. Hindi is not a predominant language in Mexico. Now, I will answer the second question. Step 2: Identify which region or country the question is referring to. Justification: In order to determine which state speaks pure Hindi, it's important to clarify the geographical context. Result: The question does not specify a country or region. Therefore, I will assume the question is referring to the world, and I will answer based on the country where Hindi is predominantly spoken. Step 3: Research the primary country where Hindi is spoken and determine the areas where pure Hindi is spoken. Justification: Knowing the primary country where Hindi is spoken will allow me to determine the specific areas or states within that country where pure Hindi is spoken. Result: After researching, I found that Hindi is predominantly spoken in India. Within India, states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh are known for speaking pure Hindi. Finally, I will answer the multi-choice problem to determine if the two questions are inquiring about the same information. Step 4: Compare the information requested in both questions. Justification: Comparing the requested information in both questions will allow me to determine whether the questions are asking for the same information.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrived in Paris on Sunday morning, less than two weeks after a judge dismissed sexual assault charges against him in an international scandal that altered France's political landscape. The former International Monetary Fund chief was greeted with applause at a Paris airport before leaving in a private car and coming home to his apartment. He was accompanied by his wife, journalist Anne Sinclair. On Saturday, Strauss-Kahn was mobbed by reporters in New York as he left the brownstone where he had been staying. His homecoming marks the end of a four-month court battle involving a man who had been favored to be the next president of France. Strauss-Kahn was pulled off a Paris-bound plane on May 14 in New York over accusations he sexually assaulted a Guinean maid in a luxury hotel suite in the city. Days later, he resigned from the International Monetary Fund, spent a few days in jail and was put under house arrest. His lawyers have maintained his innocence throughout the process. \\"There was an act in that room that was consensual, not forcible,\\" Benjamin Brafman said. Questions arose over the credibility of the accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, prompting prosecutors to back off. In July, prosecutors said Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest and dropped the charges on August 23, citing the accuser's credibility issues. \\"If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so,\\" prosecutors said at the time. Strauss-Kahn largely remained in New York even after a judge removed his house arrest restrictions. The diplomat's return to Paris on Sunday marks his first since the scandal broke out. Strauss-Kahn's arrest sent shock waves through France and redefined the landscape of the country's upcoming presidential race. His homecoming raises the possibility of his return to politics or a prominent position in the government. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo and an accusation of attempted rape by a French writer. The diplomat and his wife have been one of France's power couples since they married in 1989. CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.

Title: Silver Saddle Movie plot: The film opens in a small South Texas bordertown in the 1850s. A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels.

Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before. The murder is arraigned to take place in a graveyard outside town where Barrett is expected to arrive. Blood lies in wait until a carriage eventually...

Options: - communication - fun - understood - ease tension - suffering","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the question, \\"Sometimes just expressing yourself is the best way to be what?\\" is understood. Expressing oneself is a vital part of human interaction. When we take the time to express ourselves, we provide others with an insight into our thoughts, feelings, and perspectives. This can lead to a better understanding of who we are, as well as how we view and experience the world around us. Being understood offers numerous benefits, some of which are highlighted below: 1. Enhanced Relationships: When we are understood by others, our relationships can evolve and strengthen. This is because empathy, trust, and open communication set the foundation for meaningful connections. 2. Reduced Misinterpretations: If we express ourselves clearly and authentically, we minimize the chances of our intentions or thoughts being misinterpreted. This can save us from countless misunderstandings and unnecessary conflicts. 3. Increased Self-awareness: When we communicate our needs, desires, or boundaries, we gain a better understanding of ourselves. This self-awareness encourages personal growth, as we can identify areas where improvement is needed, or where our values lie. 4. Emotional Intelligence: Expressing oneself promotes emotional intelligence, as it shows an ability to recognize and effectively deal with our emotions. This is an essential skill that helps us navigate social situations and maintain emotional well-being. 5. Validation: When others understand our thoughts and feelings, it can lead to a sense of validation. This can be comforting and reassuring, making it easier to handle tough situations or emotional experiences. 6. Problem-solving: In many cases, expressing oneself and being understood can help resolve problems or conflicts. When both parties understand each other's views, it is easier to find a solution that works for everyone involved. In conclusion, expressing oneself is the best way to be understood. By openly and honestly conveying our thoughts and feelings, we allow others to gain insight into our perspectives, which can lead to deeper connections, better relationships, and enhanced personal growth. While the other options, such as communication or easing tension, are also worthwhile results of self-expression, the most suitable outcome is gaining understanding from those around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Egypt's state news agency says the country's top prosecutor has referred ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi to trial on charges of inciting the killing of opponents protesting outside his palace while he was in office. A supporter of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi chants slogans against Egyptian Army during a march following Friday Muslim prayers at Nasser City in Cairo, Egypt, Friday, Aug. 30, 2013. Tens of... (Associated Press) The military ousted Morsi on July 3 after millions took to the street demanding he step down. He's been held incommunicado since. Prosecutors have accused him of conspiring with foreign groups to break out of prison during the chaos of the country's 2011 uprising. Sunday's decision however is the first referral to trial. Morsi will be tried, along with 14 members of his Muslim Brotherhood, in a criminal court for allegedly committing acts of violence, inciting the killing of at least 10. No date was announced for the trial. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Egypt's interim president appointed a 50-member committee Sunday dominated by secularists to review proposed amendments to the country's Islamist-drafted constitution, moving ahead with a military-backed transition plan as protests over the coup that ousted the country's president wane. The committee is to begin discussions Sept. 8 on the changes proposed by a 10-member panel of judges, also appointed by interim President Adly Mansour. It is then expected to put the amended charter to a public vote within 60 days, presidential spokesman Ihab Badawi said. That follows a military-backed transition plan that calls for parliamentary and presidential elections early next year in the wake of the July 3 popularly backed coup that toppled President Mohammed Morsi. The new review committee is dominated by liberal and secular public figures and politicians. Five women sit on the committee. There are four representatives from the youth groups that led the protests against Morsi and his predecessor, longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. There are also only three church representatives on the committee and no private citizens who are Christians. There are three representatives of Al-Azhar, the Sunni world's most prestigious learning institute that represents moderate Islam. There are also representatives from professional unions, universities and the arts. Badawi said Morsi' group, the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, and five other Islamist parties were tapped to nominate candidates. Only one, Bassam el-Zarka of the leading ultraconservative al-Nour party, came forward. The Salafi al-Nour party said the selection criteria for the judges and their discussion to amend articles was less transparent than the actions of committee under Morsi, which were carried live on television. Al-Nour said it would argue in the committee to restore articles that stress the Islamic nature of the state, and outlaw insulting religious figures and violating social mores, which would be removed in an amendment proposed by the judges. Badawi said a former member of the Brotherhood, Kamal el-Helbawi, also has agreed to sit on the committee and \\"will take into consideration the interests\\" of the group. It is not yet clear how the committee will vote on the amendments, an issue which could complicate and prolong discussions. The amendments suggested by the judges removed controversial articles from the constitution, which were hotly contested by Morsi's opposition. Some articles gave Muslim clerics a final say over legislation, and one gave room for stricter interpretation and implementation of Islamic laws. The Islamist-drafted constitution was one of the most divisive issues during Morsi's one year in office. It was suspended after the military ousted Morsi on July 3 following massive protests demanding he step down. Lawmakers elected the Islamist-dominated 100-member committee that drafted the constitution under Morsi. It included 60 people affiliated with Islamist groups, six women and six Christians. That selection raised criticism of poor representation from youth groups and the secular opposition. Liberals twice walked out of committees drafting the constitution, complaining that the Brotherhood and its allies dominated the process and stifled their suggestions. They said the charter undermined freedoms and rights and sought to imbue a strict interpretation of Islam into Egypt's laws. Protests over the constitution and the direction of the country turned deadly after Morsi issued temporary decrees in late November that put himself and the drafting committee above judicial oversight. The constitution was then finalized in a rushed overnight session and passed with a slight majority in a hastily called referendum in December 2012. ||||| Supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi hold his picture and a poster (R) showing the ''Rabaa'' or ''four'' gesture, in reference to the police clearing of the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp on August 14, during a protest against the military and the interior... CAIRO Egypt's army-backed authorities referred deposed President Mohamed Mursi to trial on Sunday on charges of inciting murder and violence, in an escalation of the crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood. The new government also named a constituent assembly almost devoid of Islamists and gave it 60 days to review amendments that would erase Islamic articles brought in last year by the Brotherhood and more hardline Islamic parties. Nearly two months after the army deposed Mursi, the moves underscored Egypt's dramatic power shift as its new rulers tighten their grip and crack down on the Islamists who rose to power through the ballot box after Hosni Mubarak's downfall. A state prosecutor charged Mursi and 14 other Brotherhood members with \\"committing acts of violence, and inciting killing and thuggery\\", the state news agency reported. The charges relate to violence in which around a dozen people were killed outside the presidential palace last December, after Mursi had ignited protesters' rage with a decree that expanded his powers. The episode was one of the most violent of his presidency. Tens of thousands gathered outside the presidency to demonstrate against Mursi's decree and a divisive, Islamist-tinged constitution that he planned to put to a referendum. The Brotherhood's leaders called on members to rally to his defense. The state news agency said they were now accused of mobilizing their followers to forcibly disperse the protesters after the security forces rejected Mursi's orders to do so. The charges against Mursi include inciting his followers and assistants to commit crimes of premeditated murder and use violence and thuggery. Mursi is also being investigated over his escape from jail during the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. He is suspected of murder and conspiring with the Palestinian group Hamas during his escape, though no formal charges have been brought. Both the European Union and the United States, source of 1.3 billion in annual military aid to Cairo, had called for Mursi's release after he was detained following his overthrow on July 3. MASS PROTESTS He was toppled just a year into his term following mass protests fuelled by anger at economic mismanagement and Brotherhood attempts to entrench its power. His downfall has led to some of the worst violence in Egypt's modern history, in the form of protests by his supporters, a bloody police crackdown on those supporters, and militant attacks on the police and churches. At least 900 people, most of them Mursi supporters, were killed last month after the authorities smashed two protest camps set up by Mursi's supporters in Cairo. Around 100 of the dead were members of the security forces, killed in what the state has described as a Brotherhood campaign of terrorism. The group denies resorting to violence, saying the government is using the charge to justify the crackdown. Mursi's fall has also triggered a spike in violence in the Sinai Peninsula, where hardline militants expanded into a security vacuum left by the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. Underlining the growing threat of attacks, an army source said three people had been arrested for opening fire with machine guns on a ship passing through the Suez Canal, the global shipping artery that runs through Egyptian territory. During Saturday's unsuccessful attack, the Panamanian-registered container ship COSCO ASIA came under fire in a northern section of the canal, the source said. Canal Authority sources said a rocket-propelled grenade was also used. The Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful resistance. It managed to bring thousands into the street last Friday in demonstrations against what it views as a \\"putschist regime\\" that aims to turn Egypt back into a police state. The government says it will restore democracy with parliamentary and presidential elections once amendments to the constitution are approved in a referendum. PANEL OF 50 The presidency named a 50-member panel that will review an extensive set of amendments drawn up by a \\"panel of experts\\". The proposals would remove Islamic-influenced articles including one that gave Muslim scholars a say over some affairs of state, and also lift a ban on some Mubarak-era officials assuming public office. Drawn up by a 10-member \\"committee of experts\\" appointed by decree, the draft preserves the privileged status of the military, which it effectively shields from civilian oversight. Although Islamists won five popular votes held since 2011, the constituent assembly will have only two Islamists among its members. One belongs to the hardline Salafi Nour party, the other is a former Brotherhood leader now harshly critical of the group he left last year. \\"It's a very establishment list,\\" said Nathan Brown, an expert on Egypt based at George Washington University in the United States. The presidency said six Islamist parties, including the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, had been approached to fill the two seats set aside for Islamists. Only Nour had responded. The Brotherhood says it wants nothing to do with the army's plans for Egypt. The Brotherhood and the Nour Party secured a major say over the last constitution-drafting process by winning some 70 percent of the seats in parliamentary elections held after Mubarak's downfall. Critics said the Islamists then sidelined other groups in a process that failed to reflect Egypt's diversity. The constitution was signed into law last December by Mursi after being approved in a referendum. The Nour Party complained of a \\"disregard and exclusion of the Islamist current\\" in the make-up of the review panel. Nour, which was founded after Mubarak's fall, noted that the committee left out members of the youth movements that ignited the uprising of January 25, 2011, \\"raising doubts about the panel's position towards the revolution\\".

Title: Awakenings Movie plot: In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a dedicated and caring physician at a Bronx hospital. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917-1928 encephalitis lethargica epidemic, Sayer discovers that certain stimuli reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states: Activities such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. While patient Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, Sayer soon discovers that Lowe is able to communicate with him using a Ouija board.After attending a lecture on the subject of L-Dopa and its success with Parkinson's sufferers, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Lowe yields astounding results, as he completely \\"awakens\\" from his catatonic state; inspiring Sayer to seek funding so that all his patients can receive L-Dopa and experience \\"awakenings\\" back to reality.Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another patient, and begins spending time with her when she comes to the hospital to visit her father. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions on him as an in-patient, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases, and stirs up a bit of a revolt in the process of arguing his case repeatedly to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated while battling administrators and staff about his perceived confinement, a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest that Leonard has difficulty controlling.While Sayer and the hospital staff continue to delight in the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary triumph.

The force a magnet exerts is a little different from the forces you may normally think about. You exert a force on a book when you lift it. You also exert a force on the pedals of your bicycle. In both those cases, those forces cause a change. The change you see in both these cases is called motion. Magnets, too, can produce change. They can produce motion just like you do. Unlike you, magnets do not have to touch something to exert a force. A magnetic force is exerted over a distance. Thats right, a magnet can push or pull certain items without ever touching them. Thats how the maglev train works. Do you know another type of force that does not require objects to touch? These forces are known as non-contact forces.

Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low. Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard. Justin, therefore, always keeps a closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. A:","completion":"According to the given information and hint, the container with a lower pressure inside it will be the one that has its gas at a lower temperature. In this case, Nicholas keeps his closed container of nitrogen gas in the freezer, where the temperature is very low, while Justin keeps his closed container of propane gas outside, where the temperature is high. The pressure change in a container holding a gas is related to the temperature change via the ideal gas law, which is expressed as: PV = nRT Where: - P is the pressure of the gas - V is the volume of the container - n is the amount of gas (in moles) - R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) - T is the temperature of the gas (in Kelvin) When the temperature of a gas in a closed container decreases, like that of the nitrogen gas in the freezer, the pressure of the gas also decreases. This is because the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is reduced, causing them to exert less force during collisions with the walls of the container. In contrast, when the temperature increases, as in the case of the propane gas container outside, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, leading to more forceful collisions and increased pressure. Given that Nicholas's container of nitrogen gas is kept in the freezer at a low temperature and Justin's container of propane gas is kept outside at a relatively higher temperature, the container of nitrogen gas will have a lower pressure inside it compared to the container of propane gas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal... From the passage, we know that _ . A) Genetic mutations are caused by old age and physical disorders B) When a man becomes older, sperm-producing cells copy his DNA less effectively C) One of the advantages older fathers have is that their children can live a longer life D) Researchers advise men to avoid having fathering children at older ages.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: He said, \\"Now what's biting you?\\" Here is a hypothesis: He asked, \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" Here are the options: Possible answers: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis holds true when the premise is true, we must first analyze the statements and compare them in terms of meaning and context. The premise: \\"Now what's biting you?\\" In this statement, the speaker uses the phrase \\"biting you\\" to ask the listener about their concerns or issues in a metaphorical manner. The term \\"biting\\" is often used to express annoyance or irritation. Therefore, the overall meaning of the premise is to ask the person what is bothering or causing discomfort to them at that moment. The hypothesis: \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" This statement has a similar intention as the premise. The speaker asks about the listener's concerns or issues but uses the word \\"bothering\\" instead of the metaphorical \\"biting\\". Both the hypothesis and premise have the same goal: to inquire about the person's current concerns or irritations. Now let us consider the options: a) Yes: Choosing this option would mean that if the premise is true, the hypothesis would also be true. Since both the premise and the hypothesis have the same intention and meaning, it is possible that when one holds true, the other also holds true. Both are inquiries into the person's concerns, and stating one does not contradict the other. b) It is not possible to tell: Selecting this option would indicate that there is not enough information to determine the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. However, as we have analyzed the meaning and intention of both statements, they seemed to closely align in meaning and purpose. c) No: Choosing this as an answer would mean that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is not true. However, this doesn't seem applicable in our case, as both statements have the same meaning and intention. Based on the analysis and comparison of the premise and hypothesis, it is reasonable to conclude that: If the premise is true: \\"Now what's biting you?\\" Then it is possible that the hypothesis is also true: \\"Now what's bothering you?\\" Hence, the answer to the question is a) yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did Trump think of his endorsement?

What is the answer: Which other US President died on July 4th 1826, the same day as John Adams?","completion":"Thomas Jefferson was the other US President who died on July 4th, 1826, the same day as John Adams. The deaths of these two Founding Fathers and former presidents on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence was seen as a remarkable coincidence and a historic event in the United States. Thomas Jefferson's and John Adams' lives were deeply intertwined in the history of the United States. While they had their differences and experienced phases of animosity, they both played crucial roles in the founding of the nation. Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Before that, he served as Vice President under John Adams, who was the second President of the United States from 1797 to 1801. Adams played a significant role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, and was one of the drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson and Adams had a falling out due to their differing political views in the early years of the republic, but they later reconciled and resumed their friendship, engaging in a rich correspondence for more than a decade. This correspondence touched upon various intellectual, philosophical, and political subjects and cemented their bond. Both men passed away on July 4th, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence - an event that has been widely interpreted as a testament to their strong connection to the founding of the United States and the significance of their roles in shaping the country. In a poignant twist, John Adams' last words were reported to be \\"Thomas Jefferson still survives,\\" unaware that Jefferson had, in fact, passed away just hours earlier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(B). yes.","completion":"The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, so the answer is: (A). No. I will provide answers to both questions: 1. How does the U.N. get funding? The United Nations gets funding from its member states through assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions are mandatory payments made by member states, which are calculated based on each country's capacity to pay. This calculation is determined by factors such as a country's gross national income (GNI) and share of the world economy. The largest portion of assessed contributions goes toward the UN's peacekeeping efforts and the regular budget, which is used for day-to-day operations. Voluntary contributions come from member states, non-governmental organizations, and other private or public sources. These funds are directed towards specialized agencies, programs, or specific projects, and can vary greatly depending on the priorities of the contributor. 2. Is it true that the US is funding ISIS? It is not true that the US is intentionally funding ISIS. The United States has been actively engaged in countering the threat posed by ISIS and has provided military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to countries impacted by the group's activities. Additionally, the US-led international coalition has conducted airstrikes and provided training to local forces fighting against ISIS. However, it should be noted that in complex conflict situations, funds and weapons can sometimes unintentionally end up in the hands of undesirable or hostile groups, but this is not a direct indication that the US is intentionally funding ISIS."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: 'Halo 4' is franchise's best yet Combat in \\"Halo 4\\" is more strategic than the hard-charging style we've come to know from previous \\"Halo\\" games. (CNN) -- For all of its expected action and drama, the new \\"Halo 4\\" boils down to an essential question: Are its central characters humans, machines or something in between? The answer may still be unclear by the time you're done playing this fantastic game. This edition of the hugely popular \\"Halo\\" franchise was developed by 343 Industries, which took over after Bungie Studios, creators of the first four games, split from Microsoft. To its credit, 343 Industries has retained the intense first-person shooter action \\"Halo\\" fans are used to but upped the emotional interplay between the iconic Master Chief and his artificial-intelligence companion, Cortana. The action begins with Master Chief in cryosleep and Cortana starting to undergo rampancy, a condition for older AIs in which they actually think themselves to death. At one point, Cortana likens it to having 1,000 arguments with herself, but she tries desperately to hang on to her sanity to help the Chief, her human ally. The connection between these two characters makes this campaign really special. From the opening scene with Catherine Halsey, the creator of the story's super-soldier program, to its climax, the tension between humans and machines runs throughout the story. Web series builds anticipation for 'Halo 4' Cortana seems more emotive than before -- a welcome addition to the character. Master Chief retains his detached, no-nonsense soldier persona for most of the campaign, but there are moments you want his helmet to come off so you can see the facial expressions you sense he's making. \\"Halo 4\\" hooked me emotionally before I realized it. Some scenes made me feel waves of despair or elation before I recognized I was mirroring the emotions in the game -- truly a sign of an immersive experience. The graphics of \\"Halo 4\\" are outstanding in their detailed depictions of characters and background environments. Whether foliage for a jungle setting or the individualized movement of little bits of wreckage, each scene is treated with careful attention to the smallest element. Characters look like live-action actors, and their movements and emotions have a realistic, almost filmlike quality. This technique has been used in other games, but \\"Halo 4\\" raises the bar for others to emulate. The voice acting and dialogue are fantastic and help pull you into the story. You'll quickly hate some characters based merely on the inflection in their voice. (You may even wish you could shoot them in the face -- I know I did -- but you can't.) The game introduces a new character from the recent \\"Halo\\" Web series, and I sometimes wondered if I was missing inside jokes from the related \\"Halo\\" books. But knowing the entire \\"Halo\\" universe isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this game. There are eight missions in the single-player campaign, with plenty of weapons and vehicles from which to choose. Combat in the game seemed more strategic than the straightforward, hard-charging style we've come to know from previous \\"Halo\\" titles. For example, using the armor's jump-pack accessory allows players to leap up to hidden spots and pick off enemies. And other armor abilities allow Master Chief to create a floating turret, which I found great for thinning out a battlefield before wading in. Don't worry, fans -- the big action sequences are still there. \\"Halo 4's\\" epic fight sequences require players to confront waves of enemies in one mission, then pick off bad guys one by one in another. And of course, co-op and online multiplayer action is available if you want to include a friend or try your luck against an opponent. Despite all the mayhem, what stood out for me about \\"Halo 4\\" was the story. The new developers made an effort to delve into the characters we've known over the years and morph them into something fresh. The \\"man or machine\\" question becomes more prevalent as the game progresses, and I found myself looking at different missions and scenes through that lens. Is Cortana more human as her mind begins to splinter? Does John-117, the solder we know as Master Chief, become a robotic killing machine? Or have both influenced each other so much that the differences we expect between the two become mixed, creating a symbiotic relationship that only becomes evident when one side lets down the other? During one tense scene, Master Chief tells Cortana, \\"I was supposed to protect you.\\" She replies, \\"We were supposed to protect each other.\\" The deepening interactions between these two main characters enhance the narrative and make \\"Halo 4\\" a wonderful new addition to a beloved franchise -- and the best \\"Halo\\" campaign so far. It keeps me wanting to play over and over again. \\"Halo 4\\" is available now throughout most of the world and will be available Thursday in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive title. It is rated M for mature due to blood and violence. Online interactions are not rated. This review was done with a provided limited edition copy and is solely focused on the single-player campaign. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"\\"Halo 4\\" stands out as the best installment in the franchise so far, with impressive graphics, immersive storytelling, and a deep emotional connection between Master Chief and Cortana, making the game a truly captivating experience.

Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Information: - The Lampyrinae are a large subfamily of fireflies (Lampyridae). The exact delimitation, and the internal systematics, are a matter of debate; for long this group was used as a \\"wastebin taxon\\" to hold any fireflies with insufficiently resolved relationships. Regardless, they are very diverse even as a good monophyletic group, containing flashing and continuous-glow fireflies from the Holarctic and some tropical forms too. The ancestral Lampyrinae probably had no or very primitive light signals; in any case several modern lineages have returned to the pheromone communication of their ancestors independently it seems. - A pheromone (from Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"to bear\\" and hormone, from Ancient Greek \\"\\") is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are chemicals capable of acting outside the body of the secreting individual to impact the behavior of the receiving individuals. There are \\"alarm pheromones\\", \\"food trail pheromones\\", \\"sex pheromones\\", and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Pheromones are used from basic unicellular prokaryotes to complex multicellular eukaryotes. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented. In addition, some vertebrates, plants and ciliates communicate by using pheromones. - Diaphanes is a genus of firefly in the Lampyrinae subfamily . Species within this genus are : D. citrinus D. exsanguis D. formosus D. guttatus D. lampyroides D. limbatus D. marginella D. mendax D. nubilus D. pectinealis - The Holarctic is the name for the biogeographic realm that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combining Wallace's Palearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North Africa and all of Eurasia (with the exception of the southern Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent), and the Nearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North America north of Southern Mexico. These regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic realm.

By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism.

As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series.

There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Do the high frequency sounds have a longer or shorter wavelength than the low frequency sounds? Answer:","completion":"In the context of the paragraph provided, Bill is working with sound effects that have varying frequencies, ranging from very high to very low. To understand the relationship between frequency and wavelength, it's necessary to comprehend the basics of wave properties and behavior. Sound travels in waves, and these waves have certain characteristics, such as frequency and wavelength. Frequency refers to the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a specific time period, usually expressed in Hertz (Hz). High frequency sounds have more cycles per second, while low frequency sounds have fewer cycles per second. In general, sound with a higher frequency is considered as a high pitch sound, whereas sound with lower frequency is considered as a low pitch sound. Wavelength, on the other hand, is the physical length of one wave cycle. It is the distance between two consecutive points in a wave that are in the same phase, such as two wave peaks or two troughs. Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other, according to the following formula: speed of sound = frequency × wavelength With the speed of sound being constant in a medium (approximately 343 meters per second in air at room temperature), it's clear that as the frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease, and vice versa. Given this information, the high frequency sounds that Bill captured in the sound studio would have shorter wavelengths, while the low frequency sounds would have longer wavelengths. This inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength is applicable to all types of waves, including sound, light, and electromagnetic waves. In summary, high frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths, while low frequency sounds have longer wavelengths."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"D) Because her father was seriously ill."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: The Greeks (Greek: Ellenes) have been identified by many ethnonyms. The most common native ethnonym is \\"Hellen\\" (Ellen), pl. Hellenes (Ellenes); the name \\"Greeks\\" (Latin: Graeci) was used by the Ancient Romans and gradually entered the European languages through its use in Latin. The mythological patriarch Hellen is the named progenitor of the Greek peoples; his descendants the Aeolians, Dorians, Achaeans and Ionians correspond to the main Greek tribes and to the main dialects spoken in Greece and Asia Minor (Anatolia). Context: There is currently no satisfactory etymology for the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name of the priests of Zeus in Dodona, \\"Selloi\\" (Selloi; also Elloi Helloi), changed to Sellanes (by analogy with Akarnanes) and then to Hellanes and Hellenes. This theory is based on Aristotle's comments in Meteorologica where he places Ancient Hellas in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, where in his opinion the great deluge of Deucalion must have occurred. The land was inhabited by Selloi and Graeci, who later came to be known as Hellenes. In that regard Graici (Graikoi) was a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. Homer mentions that the Selloi were the prophets of Zeus at Dodona, but he is referring to Zeus of Dodona as god of the Pelasgians who were Pre-Dorian populations. It is possible that the extension of a particular cult of Zeus in Dodona (a tendency among the Greeks to form ever-larger communities and amphictionies) caused the name to further extend to the rest of the peninsula. However, this theory connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus, and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. The toponyms, especially an ancient city Hellas in southern Thessaly and the Greek tradition indicate that the name Hellenes is Pre-Dorian and that it is more likely that the homeland of the Graikoi who were later called Hellenes was in central Greece. The Greek tradition mentions an earlier deluge of Ogyges in the region of Boeotia which was occupied by the Minyans a group of autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region was called Graike in ancient times probably after the old city of Graea (from Proto-Greek grau-j-, \\"old lady\\") on the coast. Homer refers to Hellenes as an originally relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia. During the era of the Trojan War they were centered along the settlements of Alos, Alope, Trachis, and the Pelasgian Argos. This Homeric Hellas is expressly described as \\"kalligunaikos\\", kalligynaikos, \\"of beautiful women\\", and its warriors, the Hellenes, along with the feared Myrmidons, were under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Graikoi).Alcman (7th century BC) also refers that the mothers of Hellenes were Graikoi. In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia with Pyrrha, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. The name Hellenes was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League. This was an ancient association of Greek tribes with twelve founders which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to legend it was founded after the Trojan War, by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen. Question: Are there any potential ideas as to how the name was created?. Whats the answer?","completion":"There are several potential ideas and theories as to how the name \\"Hellenes\\" was created, but no definitive answer has been agreed upon. Some of the main theories include: 1. Selloi/Sellanes/Hellanes/Hellenes Theory: According to some scholars, the name Hellenes is derived from the priests of Zeus in Dodona, known as \\"Selloi.\\" It is believed that the name changed to Sellanes, then to Hellanes, and finally to Hellenes. This theory is based on Aristotle's comments in Meteorologica, where he identifies the land inhabited by Selloi and Graeci as Ancient Hellas in Epirus. 2. Graikoi/Graeci/Greeks Theory: Another theory suggests that \\"Graeci\\" or \\"Graikoi\\" was a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus, used by the Illyrians. Over time, this name was adopted by the Greeks and later, European languages through its use in Latin. 3. Homeric Hellas Theory: Homer mentions Hellenes as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, known for beautiful women. During the Trojan War, these warriors were under the command of Achilles. The Parian Chronicle mentions that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes, and this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Graikoi). 4. Mythological Connection: In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of the Hellenes, was the son of Deucalion, who ruled with Pyrrha as the only survivors after the great deluge. This myth may have been invented when Greek tribes began to separate, indicating a common origin. The name \\"Hellenes\\" could have been popularized following the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League, which was an association of Greek tribes that protected the temples of Apollo and Demeter. In summary, there are multiple theories about the creation of the name \\"Hellenes,\\" each with its historical and mythological connections.

The Rogue River begins at Boundary Springs on the border between Klamath and Douglas counties near the northern edge of Crater Lake National Park. Although it changes direction many times, it flows generally west for 215 miles (346 km) from the Cascade Range through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach. Communities along its course include Union Creek, Prospect, Trail, Shady Cove, Gold Hill and Rogue River, all in Jackson County; Grants Pass and Galice in Josephine County; and Agness, Wedderburn and Gold Beach in Curry County. Significant tributaries include the South Fork Rogue River, Elk Creek, Bear Creek, the Applegate River, and the Illinois River. Arising at 5,320 feet (1,622 m) above sea level, the river loses more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation by the time it reaches the Pacific. It was one of the original eight rivers named in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, which included 84 miles (135 km) of the Rogue, from 7 miles (11.3 km) west of Grants Pass to 11 miles (18 km) east of the mouth at Gold Beach. In 1988, an additional 40 miles (64 km) of the Rogue between Crater Lake National Park and the unincorporated community of Prospect was named Wild and Scenic. Of the river's total length, 124 miles (200 km), about 58 percent is Wild and Scenic. The Rogue is one of only three rivers that start in or east of the Cascade Range in Oregon and reach the Pacific Ocean. The others are the Umpqua River and Klamath River.

Please write a short summary for the following article: COLLEGE FOOTBALL- BCS computer projections The most anticipated matchup in college football history actually lived up to its billing with one of the greatest games in history. Top-ranked USC kept its win-streak alive and secured its bid as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas in a Rose Bowl game that featured stellar performances from the heralded and unheralded alike. After a five-yard touchdown on a keeper by Heisman Finalist QB Vince Young put the Longhorns on top 7-0 half-way through the first quarter, fellow Heisman Finalist QB Matt Leinart revived an offense that looked sluggish on its first few possessions with three quick TD strikes to three different receivers and the Trojans found themselves up 21-7 at halftime. Aside from its first drive the Longhorn offense looked stale and one-dimensional. Things did not really get better in the third quarter either when Reggie Bush found his groove and then the endzone with a 32-yard run that improved the USC lead to 28-10 at the time. A David Pino field goal with a minute left in the third-quarter chipped the lead to 15, but Texas' chances still looked bleak. Apparently though, an entirely different Longhorn squad on both sides of the ball came out for the fourth quarter. USC punter Tom Malone's coffin-corner kick from the Longhorn's 36 went awry, allowing Aaron Ross to return the ball all the way to the USC four-yard line to set up a Ramonce Taylor touchdown. USC scored almost too quickly on its next possession, kicking a field goal to lead 31-20 with plenty of time to play at 10:37 in the fourth. On the second play of Texas' next possession, Vince Young put on one of the greatest shows in BCS history with a seemingly effortless 71-yard run that stunned the Trojans and left the millions watching in awe. He then took the snap from shotgun into the endzone on a draw to narrow the gap to just three after the successful two-point conversion. Texas forced USC into another short possession and punt to get the ball back on its own 12 yard line with about six minutes left in the game. It didn't quite take that long. A surprising burst from 270-pound freshman RB Henry Melton set up a 36-yard Pino field goal to cap unlikeliest of comebacks. The Trojans offensive weapons were just too much for the exhausted Longhorn's though. USC used runs by both Reggie Bush and LenDale White as well as four key completions by Leinart to prepare for a 43-yard field goal. Mario Danelo's kick sailed through the uprights with 31 seconds remaining and a Rose Bowl victory in sights. Young missed on deep attempts on the final Texas possession and the Trojans walked away the victors. The two-headed all-purpose monster of Bush and White combined for 360 yards from scrimmage and Leinart was spectacular in the biggest game of his illustrious collegiate career, going 22-40 for 290 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.

Nude and freaked out on LSD, Horace and his small group of cohorts are oblivious to the fact that they're being watched by Sylvia, a young girl observing them from the trees. One of the hippies is pregnant and is not taking part in the ritual; she sees Sylvia and drags her into the clearing, where Horace freaks out over the fact that their ritual has been observed. A more recent member of the group, Andy, admits that he met Sylvia in town and invited her along, prompting Horace to violently hit him. Sylvia becomes frightened and runs away, but two other members of the group chase after her and catch her in the woods, where they brutalize her.The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the small town's bakery. With Mildred is Pete, Sylvia's younger brother who appears to be about 12 or 13. Together, they take Sylvia back home to where she lives with Pete and their grandfather, Banner. Mildred is sure her boyfriend will know who victimized Sylvia--with the town deserted, the only other people in the area are the construction crew working on a dam near the town. Mildred drives to the dam and informs her boyfriend, who works at the site. He tells her he will look into it.Meanwhile, Horace and his group have discovered that their van is now broken down and useless. They abandon it in the woods and walk to the town on foot. The first thing they see is the bakery, and Mildred sells them meat pies, throwing in a few extra things as a kindness for them. Horace tells them that he and his friends are rock musicians stranded there, and he asks where they can seek shelter. Mildred explains that Valley Hills only has a few residents, most of them long gone. Only she and a few others remain, awaiting the demolition of the town in the near future.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the names of the bands who were specifically designated \\"new wave\\"? In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable.

Write a title: The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that employers may post regulations in the workplace that critics contend will discourage workers from organizing bargaining units or engaging in other union activities.","completion":"Title: The Impact of the National Labor Relations Board's Ruling on Employers Posting Workplace Regulations and the Potential Suppression of Union Activities Introduction: Recently, a substantial ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has sparked controversy among employers and labor unions alike. This ruling, which allows employers to post workplace regulations related to union activities, has been met with criticism from those who believe it has the potential to inhibit workers from organizing bargaining units and engaging in other collective actions. Body: I. Overview of the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) Job and Authority A. The NLRB: An independent federal agency tasked with enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) B. The NLRB's jurisdiction: Covers most private sector employers and employees, except for agricultural laborers, independent contractors, and those employed by a parent or spouse II. The Ruling that Permits Employers to Post Workplace Regulations A. The crux of the ruling: Asserts that employers can display rules or posters that influence union activities B. Examples of regulations: Restrictions on the use of company bulletin boards and email systems for union activities, rules surrounding employees gathering in break rooms, or soliciting signatures for union authorization cards on company property III. Critiques of the Ruling and its Potential Effects on Union Activity A. Critics contend that the ruling may suppress workers' rights to organize and participate in union-driven activities B. Key concerns: 1. Employees may feel pressured to refrain from union organization due to potential employer retaliation 2. The presence of regulations could create an atmosphere of intimidation or fear around discussing or pursuing union matters IV. Employers' Perspective on the Ruling A. Employers argue that posting workplace regulations is necessary for maintaining control over company property and ensuring employees focus on work-related tasks B. The potential benefits for employers: 1. Enhanced workflow and productivity without interruptions from union-related activities 2. A decrease in potential conflicts and disputes emerging from union organization and discussions on company property 3. Greater overall control over company culture and employee conduct V. Balancing Interests: Striking a Compromise between Employers and Labor Unions A. Recognizing and respecting employees' rights to organize and participate in union activities according to the NLRA B. Establishing clear communication and understanding between employers and employees to avoid unnecessary disputes and conflicts Conclusion: The ruling by the National Labor Relations Board permitting employers to post workplace regulations has been met with significant controversy as critics argue that it may suppress workers' rights to engage in union activities. While employers maintain that regulations are necessary to protect company interests, it is crucial to strike a balance between the rights of both parties. Ensuring that employers respect and acknowledge their employees' rights to organize while establishing clear and open communication will help mediate conflicts and maintain a harmonious workplace environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Crown my teeth. The speech crowned the meeting. Does the word \\"crown\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"crown\\" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences provided. The term 'crown' is being used as a verb in both instances but it applies to different contexts: dental health and a social event, respectively. 1. \\"Crown my teeth\\" - In this sentence, 'crown' refers to a common dental procedure. A crown in dentistry is a type of dental restorative treatment. It's essentially a cap that completely covers or encircles a tooth or dental implant. Crowns are often used when a large cavity threatens the ongoing health of a tooth. They are typically bonded to the tooth using a dental cement. Dental crowns can be made from various materials, which include ceramics, zirconia, porcelain, or metal. Crowning a tooth requires a number of steps. First, the dentist prepares the tooth by removing the outer portion, any decay and shaping the tooth for the crown. If additional tooth structure is needed to support the crown, a core build-up may be done. An impression is then made to provide an exact model of the prepared tooth. This is sent to a dental lab, where the permanent crown will be made. A temporary crown is made to protect the tooth while the permanent one is being made. Once ready, the permanent crown is cemented in place. 2. \\"The speech crowned the meeting.\\" - In this example, 'crowned' is a metaphorical usage, which means to conclude, climax, or bring something to a successful or impressive end - essentially to place a metaphorical highlight or \\"crown\\" on the event. This use of \\"crown\\" implies that the speech was the pinnacle or highlight of the meeting, it encapsulated or summarized the main points, or just capped the meeting off with a strong, memorable moment or message. In summary, while both uses of 'crown' imply an act of completion or finality, they refer to vastly different processes – one physical and specific, and one metaphorical and general.

Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter , and retailers are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities.

Solve this instance: 1, 19, ['c', 'Z', 'w', 'F', '6905', 'Y', '711', 'a', '2057', 'T', 'a', '3193', '3649', '5749', 'O', 'b', 'Y', 'G', '3571', '9417', '899', '2121', 'F', 'u', '4693', '9987', '5213', 'b', '5269', '2439'] Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the problem. Here's the solution for the given instance: 1. We are given i = 1, j = 19, and A = ['c', 'Z', 'w', 'F', '6905', 'Y', '711', 'a', '2057', 'T', 'a', '3193', '3649', '5749', 'O', 'b', 'Y', 'G', '3571', '9417', '899', '2121', 'F', 'u', '4693', '9987', '5213', 'b', '5269', '2439'] 2. First, let's find the elements from the ith to the jth element, which are A[1:20] since i = 1 and j = 19. (Remember that in Python, the range is inclusive on the left side and exclusive on the right side.) A[1:20] = ['Z', 'w', 'F', '6905', 'Y', '711', 'a', '2057', 'T', 'a', '3193', '3649', '5749', 'O', 'b', 'Y', 'G', '3571', '9417'] 3. Next, we need to reverse the order of these elements: Reversed = ['9417', '3571', 'G', 'Y', 'b', 'O', '5749', '3649', '3193', 'a', 'T', '2057', 'a', '711', 'Y', '6905', 'F', 'w', 'Z'] 4. Finally, we concatenate these elements to form the output string: Output = '94173571GYbO574936493193aT2057a711Y6905FwZ' So the resultant string for the given instance is '94173571GYbO574936493193aT2057a711Y6905FwZ'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To determine whether the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is true or not, we need more information and context regarding the premise \\"and run over.\\" The phrase \\"and run over\\" can imply that someone or something has experienced being run over, but without further context, we cannot definitively confirm if the statement \\"I have been run over\\" is accurate. There are several scenarios where the phrase \\"and run over\\" might apply. For example: 1. As part of a traumatic experience of an individual who is saying, \\"I have been pushed and run over by a car.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" would be true. 2. As part of a machine or robot's operational history where it narrates, \\"I have been programmed and run over numerous systems checks.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is not true, as the context refers to running system checks and not physically being run over. 3. As part of a conversation where an individual is describing someone else's situation, like \\"She was traveling to the store and run over by an intoxicated driver.\\" In this case, the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is not true, as the person saying the phrase is not the one who was run over. 4. As a figurative expression where an individual feels overwhelmed or taken advantage of, as in \\"I have been mentally exhausted and run over by my workload.\\" While the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" could be considered true in a metaphorical sense, it is not meant to be taken literally. Without more information about the context in which \\"and run over\\" is used, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis \\"I have been run over\\" is true or not.

He talks about Jay Gatsby, the most hopeful man he had ever met. Nick's doctor suggests that he writes his thoughts down, since writing is Nick's passion. In the summer of 1922, Nick moves from the Midwest to New York after abandoning writing. He rents a small house in the North Shore village of West Egg, next to the mansion of Gatsby, a mysterious business magnate who often holds extravagant parties. One day, while Nick has dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, he is introduced to Jordan Baker by Daisy, who hopes to make a match between them.

It appears that the tweet is a response to a previous conversation or a question related to the potential uses of a ladder. Without complete context, it is challenging to pinpoint the exact sentiment; however, we can still infer certain aspects of the emotion behind the tweet. 1. Neutral or Open-minded: The message appears to have a neutral sentiment, suggesting there are multiple possibilities when it comes to using or modifying a ladder. The tone seems open-minded, allowing for creative or unconventional ideas from others while discussing what they \\"could do\\" with the ladder. 2. Casual and Informal: The tweet appears casual and informal in nature, thanks to the lowercase letters and the omission of punctuation. It indicates a laid-back, conversational approach to express the idea that many things could be done to or with the ladder. 3. Engaging and Encouraging: The tone of the tweet also comes across as engaging and encouraging. It involves the recipient of the tweet (either a user or a general audience) in the discussion and invites them to think creatively and share their own ideas on the topic. This can spark interest and invite potential solutions or suggestions from others. 4. Ambiguity: Being a short tweet stripped of context, there is an apparent ambiguity to the message, which makes it difficult to assign a specific sentiment. This is because the sentiment is partially affected by missing context clues or references, which shape how an emotion is perceived and inferred.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

[II] positive.).","completion":"Title: The Inception of Imagination: A Dive into the Dream-Bending Blockbuster 'Inception' [Positive Review] People love stories that make them think, question reality, and fear the unknown. When a movie successfully tackles the complexities of the human mind and gives the audience a chance to ponder the boundaries of the possible world, it leaves them wanting more. That's exactly what 'Inception', directed by master storyteller Christopher Nolan, delivers - a captivating, thrilling, and boundary-pushing cinematic experience that leaves movie enthusiasts awestruck and eager to unravel its many layers. In 'Inception', we follow the story of Don Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in infiltrating dreams to steal secrets, ideas, and information from people's subconscious. When he is presented with the opportunity to regain his lost life, Cobb assembles a highly-skilled team and embarks on a perilous journey to execute the virtually impossible task of implanting an idea, or Inception, into the mind of a young businessman, Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy). As the story unfolds, viewers are plunged into the mind-bending world of dream layers, time manipulation, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion. Nolan's distinctive and innovative storytelling blended with top-notch acting performances from of a stunning ensemble cast makes the 'Inception' an absolute masterpiece. DiCaprio, as the tormented and gifted dream thief, delivers yet another exemplary performance that has become synonymous with the caliber of his acting. Other brilliant cast members, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Ken Watanabe, execute their roles with precision and artistry, creating characters that are both relatable and fascinating. With a nearly faultless script, 'Inception' challenges viewers to remain attentive and involved throughout every twist and turn. Employing the concept of dreams within dreams, as well as the intricate rules and consequences governing the dream world, Nolan's script is a complicated puzzle that requires multiple watch-throughs to extract its full potential. The film's pacing is excellent, steadily raising the stakes and building tension towards an emotional and intense climax. Visually, 'Inception' is nothing short of breathtaking. From the first scene, the audience is treated to spectacular visual effects and jaw-dropping cinematography. The famous \\"city-folding\\" scene, along with scenes of zero gravity, and the snowy fortress assault all demonstrate the power of cutting-edge visual effects, immersing the audience completely in the dream world. Cinematographer Wally Pfister's camera work captures the essence of Nolan's vision, creating a visually stunning world full of both intense and awe-inspiring moments. The exceptional soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer adds another dimension to the movie, making every moment pulse with energy, suspense, and emotion. The haunting melody of \\"Time\\" and the iconic \\"Inception\\" horn sound have etched themselves into cinema history, acting as a testament to Zimmer's abilities to thrill and move audiences through his musical compositions. In conclusion, Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is a crowning achievement in modern cinema, a deeply thought-provoking, visually stunning and masterfully executed film. With outstanding performances from its cast, an intricate yet engaging storyline, breathtaking visuals, and an unforgettable soundtrack, 'Inception' rightly holds its place as one of the greatest movies in history that leaves viewers questioning the depths of their own dreams and the tenuous boundaries between reality and imagination."},{"prompt":"Read the below conversation.

In itself, this expression demonstrates a positive tone and is meant to bring a sense of happiness or warmth to the person receiving the message. 2. \\"@VioletJohe\\" – This is a mention of another Twitter user, indicating that the person is addressing or directing the message towards them. Here, the sentiment doesn't seem to be particularly negative or positive, but when combined with the rest of the tweet, it becomes part of a friendly interaction. 3. \\"ok, please.\\" – Although brief, this portion of the tweet can be interpreted as polite and respectful. The author is likely requesting something from @VioletJohe, but does so in a courteous manner by adding \\"please.\\" Generally, using polite language such as \\"please\\" or \\"thank you,\\" can be seen as a positive sentiment because it indicates respect and consideration towards others. Taking into account these points, it becomes apparent that the sentiment of the tweet is generally positive.

Sex with an adult who is related as parent (including adoptive parent), grandparent, child (including adopted child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, is illegal. In England and Wales the offence is against the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which effectively replaced the offence of incest with two new wider groups of offences: familial child sex offences (sections 25--29) and sex with an adult relative (sections 64--65). These laws are intended to protect the rights of people, so as to avoid potential violation. However, these laws still outlaw consensual sexual relationships between family members, even if they are fully willing and knowledgeable to the potential consequences. There has been some debate surrounding the rhetoric used by the Sexual Offences Review Team. Roffee discusses how the language used manipulates the reader to deem consensual familial sexual acts as illegal to the point of immoral. In Northern Ireland similar offences are against the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.

The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College.

Step 2: Identifying the Emotion Given the context and usage of words, the dialogue seems to come from a mildly frustrating interaction, where someone had to clarify or correct a misunderstanding. Therefore, the underlying emotion of the text appears to be 'angry' or 'frustrated', which will be categorized under 'other' as there isn't a specific class of 'frustrated' in the given options.

Given the question: Information: - William Clark Gable (February 1, 1901 November 16, 1960) was an American film actor, often referred to as \\"The King of Hollywood\\" or just simply as \\"The King\\". Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926, and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931. The next year, he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades. - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography.

I really really would not recommend this place. I came here because they offered deep dish pizza and I've read about Detroit style pizza not too long ago. I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered an 11 inch deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage and wings The pizza is, imo, on the cheaper side (in quality). The sauce isn't very spectacular. It tastes pre-packaged and you cannot taste almost any herbs in the sauce. It also doesn't taste really fresh. I noticed a chunk of dry oregano in the sauce but it didn't seem to add any flavor. The cheese is spread kinda thinly to boot, so you end up tasting more of the bread. It also does not have any particular flavor. Neither the pepperoni or the sausage stood out. Honestly the pepperoni and sausage toppings in Pizza Hut has more flavor. The crust is decent but that's as far as the positives go. The only saving grace for this place was the wings. They're done well but a place that bases its business on pizza shouldn't have better wings than pizza. I don't know how they manage to make an awful pizza. It's on par with cafeteria/frozen pizza. Think Tombstone. Red Baron would be a step up above this place. Go anywhere else. Glazier's grocery store is miles better than this pizza and better too. 7-8 versus 14 for a two person pizza.

Taped at CBS Television City, studios 41 and 43 in Hollywood since its debut on March 26, 1973, the show was packaged by the distribution company Columbia Pictures Television, which has now been replaced by Sony Pictures Television. The Young and the Restless originally aired as a half-hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production, creating \`\`a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre.'' Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them, soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue, characters, and story, with details like sets as secondary concerns. The Young and the Restless stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles, similar to Hollywood-style productions. The style of videotaping included using out-of-the-ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close-ups with bright lighting on the actors' faces. Conboy said he used lighting to create \`\`artistic effects''. Those effects made the series look dark, shadowy, and moody. The Young and the Restless' look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas. When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer, he balanced the lighting of the scenes.

Although \\"A parent is brushing their child's teeth\\" often suggests that it could be part of a bedtime routine, it cannot be definitively concluded that \\"The child is getting ready for bed so their mother is helping them\\" based on the given information. There are several reasons as to why this assumption cannot be made. Firstly, the statement does not specify whether the parent brushing the child's teeth is the mother or the father. It simply mentions \\"a parent,\\" which leaves room for the possibility that the father or another caretaker is the one performing this task. Secondly, the time at which the teeth brushing is happening is not indicated. It is a common practice for people to brush their teeth not only at bedtime but also in the morning or after meals. As such, it is not guaranteed that this action is a part of the child's bedtime routine. Thirdly, the reason behind the parent assisting the child in teeth brushing is not mentioned. The child could have a disability or temporary difficulty that requires help from a parent, regardless of the time of day. Alternatively, the parent could be teaching the child proper dental hygiene, which would not necessarily be limited to bedtime preparation.

It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Article: The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe and North America (where CBS Records released sixteen titles). This event is often seen as the \\"Big Bang\\" of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable Walkman the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets.
