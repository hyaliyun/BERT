Di seguito, troverai alcuni suggerimenti generici su come potresti tentare di migliorare la strategia: # Analisi e Ottimizzazione della Strategia 1. **Backtesting e Forward Testing**: Utilizza i dati storici per effettuare backtest esaustivi della tua strategia e analizzare risultati quali il drawdown massimo, il tasso di vincita e il rapporto rischio-rendimento. Dopo il backtesting, è cruciale condurre forward testing in un ambiente di mercato live ma su un conto demo. 2. **Ottimizzazione dei Parametri**: Ajusta i parametri come il periodo di EMA, i livelli di RSI e le soglie dello Stocastico attraverso un'ottimizzazione walk-forward, insieme a stop loss, take profit e le dimensioni del trail stop per determinare i valori che offrono le migliori prestazioni storiche. 3. **Filtro di Tendenza**: Potresti implementare un ulteriore indicatore di trend per filtrare i falsi segnali. Ad esempio, usare un periodo di EMA più lungo (come EMA 200) per identificare la direzione prevalente della tendenza e operare solo in quella direzione potrebbe ridurre il numero di trades perdenti. 4. **Filtri di Volatilità**: Usare un indicatore che misura la volatilità (come l'Average True Range, ATR) potrebbe aiutare a evitare le negoziazioni durante periodi di bassa volatilità, dove i movimenti di prezzo potrebbero non essere sufficienti a raggiungere il tuo take profit prima di ritracciare verso lo stop loss. 5. **Gestione Del Rischio**: Definisci con precisione il rischio percentuale per trade in base al tuo capitale e alla tua soglia di accettazione del rischio. Non rischiare mai troppo su un singolo trade. 6. **Stop Loss e Take Profit Dinamico**: Invece di usare valori statici per lo stop loss e il take profit, potresti impostare questi parametri in base alla volatilità del mercato o ad altre condizioni di mercato. 7. **Prevenzione dello Strike Multiplo**: Implementa una pausa dopo un trade vincente o perdente per evitare il problema psicologico del \\"vendicarsi sul mercato\\" o quello di rischiare troppo dopo una serie di successi. 8. **Notizie Economiche e Eventi di Mercato**: Evita il trading durante gli annunci di notizie economiche importanti che possono aumentare la volatilità e le probabilità di slippage. # Aspetti Fondamentali - **Costi di Transazione**: Tieni in considerazione i costi di transazione, come spread e commissioni. Questi possono erodere i profitti, specialmente se fai scalping o se fai trading con alti volumi. - **Psicologia**: Assicurati che la strategia sia in linea con il tuo stile di trading e la tua tolleranza al rischio. Non è sufficiente solo che gli aspetti tecnici funzionino; pure devi sentirsi a proprio agio nell'esecutarla. - **Giornaliera di Trading**: Mantieni un diario di trading per annotare le circostanze di ogni operazione per poterle analizzare in seguito e apprendere da ogni trade eseguito. # Test e Revisione Continui Infine, nessuna strategia di trading è perfetta o profittevole indefinitamente senza revisione. Il mercato cambia e le strategie possono dover essere aggiustate di conseguenza. Impegnati in una revisione e analisi regolari della tua strategia di trading per assicurarti che continui a funzionare come previsto e per apportare miglioramenti laddove necessario."},{"prompt":"ok. aggiungi l'ATR al codice. e imposta stop loss e take profit in relazione a questo","completion":"Per aggiungere l'ATR al tuo Expert Advisor (EA) in MT4 e impostare lo stop loss e il take profit in relazione a questo, prima dovrai specificare i parametri dell'ATR che desideri utilizzare, come il periodo.

Fu sviluppato da J. Welles Wilder e introdotto nel suo libro del 1978, \\"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\\". L'ATR non indica la direzione del movimento del prezzo, ma esclusivamente la sua volatilità. Questa è la sequenza logica per calcolare l'ATR: 1. **True Range (TR)**: Il True Range per un certo periodo è il massimo tra i seguenti tre valori: - Il valore assoluto della differenza tra l'alto attuale e il basso attuale (High - Low). - Il valore assoluto della differenza tra l'alto attuale e la chiusura precedente (High - Previous Close). - Il valore assoluto della differenza tra la chiusura precedente e il basso attuale (Previous Close - Low). 2. **Calcolo dell'ATR**: Una volta calcolati i valori di True Range, l'ATR è semplicemente la media mobile esponenziale (o in alcuni casi la media mobile semplice) di questi valori di TR per un determinato numero di periodi. Ecco come appare la formula: ATR = (Precedente ATR * (n-1) + Attuale TR) / n dove \\"n\\" è il numero di periodi utilizzati per il calcolo dell'ATR. # Utilizzo nell'EA per Stop Loss e Take Profit - **Stop Loss**: Se stai utilizzando l'ATR per impostare uno stop loss, potresti moltiplicare l'ATR per un fattore, ad esempio, 1.5 o 2. Questo significa che posizioneresti lo stop loss a una distanza dal prezzo di ingresso che è 1.5 o 2 volte l'ATR. Questo ti aiuta a definire uno stop loss che si adegua alle fluttuazioni attuali del mercato e ti protegge dai piccoli movimenti del prezzo che sono considerati \\"rumore\\" nella gamma normale dell'asset. - **Take Profit**: Allo stesso modo, l'ATR può essere utilizzato per definire un take profit. Ad esempio, potresti decidere di impostare un take profit che è 3 volte l'ATR dal prezzo di ingresso. Questo si basa sull'idea che desideri catturare un movimento significativo piuttosto che uscire dal trade troppo presto. Utilizzare l'ATR per determinare lo stop loss e il take profit permette di creare un sistema che si adatta dinamicamente alla volatilità del mercato anziché affidarsi a valori fissi che potrebbero non essere appropriati in tutti i contesti di mercato."},{"prompt":"puoi iscrivere tutto il codice compreso atr?","completion":"Certamente!

Quando si opera su un timeframe come H1 (orario), può essere necessario adattare i parametri per riflettere la maggiore volatilità e le maggiori dimensioni della candela rispetto a timeframe più brevi come M15 (15 minuti) o M5 (5 minuti). In particolare, quando si tratta di impostare gli indicatori ATR, stop loss e take profit in un timeframe H1, considera quanto segue: - **ATR (Average True Range)**: Il periodo di ATR comunemente usato è di 14, come predefinito da J. Welles Wilder nel suo libro. Tuttavia, alcune strategie possono richiedere un periodo più breve o più lungo a seconda di quanto l'utente desideri che l'indicatore sia sensibile alla volatilità recente. Potresti voler testare differenti periodi per vedere quale si adatta meglio alla tua strategia su H1. - **Stop Loss e Take Profit**: Su un timeframe H1, la dimensione dello stop loss e del take profit potrebbe dover essere maggiore rispetto ai timeframe più brevi per tenere conto dei movimenti più grandi del mercato. La moltiplicazione dell'ATR corrente per un fattore prestabilito può aiutare a riflettere questa volatilità. Potrebbero essere necessari alcuni test per determinare i moltiplicatori ottimali che bilancino il desiderio di proteggere il capitale e di lasciare abbastanza spazio al trade per muoversi nel suo percorso previsto. - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Il periodo di una EMA su un timeframe H1 può essere lo stesso che usi su altri timeframe, ma alcuni trader preferiscono adattarlo al timeframe per catturare meglio la tendenza rilevante. Anche qui, si consiglia di testare e ottimizzare. - **RSI e Stocastico**: Anche i livelli di overbought e oversold potrebbero essere diversi su H1. Mentre i valori di 20 e 80 sono generalmente accettati per RSI, potresti trovare che leggeri aggiustamenti a questi livelli possano produrre risultati migliori su un timeframe orario. In generale, ottimizzare un EA richiede un approfondito backtesting con dati storici per valutare il rendimento della strategia con i parametri attuali. Forward testing in tempo reale (su un conto demo) è altresì importante per assicurarsi che la strategia sia adatta alle attuali condizioni di mercato, incluse quelle caratteristiche del timeframe H1. Quando si opera su un timeframe orario, è anche importante essere consapevoli degli annunci economici e degli eventi di mercato che possono causare maggiore volatilità durante la sessione, portando a possibili picchi che potrebbero colpire stop loss o prendere profitto."},{"prompt":"hey","completion":"Hello!

The code assumes that the target can be found from the starting cell (0, 0). If the start position should vary, the code would need to handle that. 2. The code assumes that every cell with a negative value (\`-1\`) can be considered as a wall or an impassable cell. The BFS does not enqueue these cells as it only looks at the \`visited\` flag. 3. It also assumes that it is looking for the shortest distance to the very first occurrence of the target value, and not all occurrences. 4. The target is always a zero \`0\` in the \`main\` method example. If you want to look for another value, you would have to change the \`target\` variable accordingly. # Potential Improvement: Before enqueuing a neighboring cell, you should additionally check if that cell's value is not a wall (presumably \`-1\`), which would be done by checking \`maze[currentRow +/- 1][currentCol +/- 1] != -1\` respectively. As long as these assumptions are intended, and the maze is properly formatted (i.e., contains the target and the starting cell can reach it if possible), the code should work correctly and find the shortest distance to the target value."},{"prompt":"suppose we have a maze we call the cells rooms, each room have a number represent the distance between that room and the target, the number is zero for the target, and its -1 for the room that will not go to the target (doesn't lead to it)","completion":"Given your description of the maze with rooms numbered based on their distance to the target (where the target is \`0\` and rooms that do not lead to the target are \`-1\`), the current code structure will not yield accurate results as it's designed for a general breadth-first search, not for navigating a maze where distances are pre-determined. In the scenario you describe, you don't need to perform a search since you already have the distances to the target in the maze layout. Instead, you would typically start at the target cell (with a value of 0) and trace backwards to the start (or another cell), using the numerical values to guide you. If you encounter a \`-1\`, this indicates a dead-end. However, based on the code you've provided, we would require substantial changes to achieve what you're describing. You would need to modify the \`findTarget\` method to not perform a breadth-first search but to simply look at neighboring cells' distance values and move from a cell to a neighboring cell with a distance value one less than the current cell's value. Here's a conceptual example of how this might work for tracing back from a given cell to the target: \`\`\`java static Cell findTargetCell(int[][] maze) { for (int r = 0; r < maze.length; r++) { for (int c = 0; c < maze[r].length; c++) { if (maze[r][c] == 0) { // Found the target cell return new Cell(r, c, 0); } } } return null; // Target not found in the maze } static Cell traceBackToStart(int[][] maze) { Cell targetCell = findTargetCell(maze); if (targetCell == null) { System.out.println(\\"Target not found in the maze.\\"); return null; } // The starting distance is assumed to the highest distance in the maze int maxDistance = -1; for (int[] row : maze) { for (int distance : row) { if (distance > maxDistance && distance != -1) { maxDistance = distance; } } } // We start from the target and try to find a path back to the cell with maxDistance Cell currentCell = targetCell; while (currentCell.distance != maxDistance) { // Look at neighbors to find the one with distance == currentCell.distance + 1 // This code would need to be modified to actually find that neighbor } // The currentCell is now the starting cell that leads to the target return currentCell; } \`\`\` Please note that the above code sketches out a direction for how you might implement a trace-back based on the described properties of the maze. It does not provide a specific algorithm for how to find the path from the target back to the start. You would replace the comment in the while loop with logic to look for neighboring cells with a \`distance\` of \`currentCell.distance + 1\`. If the maze always contains a path from the start to the target, such a neighbor will exist except for rooms that do not lead to the target (\`-1\`).

The heroes deduce that they must use the sundial to point to the correct sequence of windows, unlocking the next staircase without triggering a temporal trap. Aria, Bran, and Celia prepare themselves to solve the sundial puzzle. The success of their quest now relies even more heavily on their synergy and intellect. Aria (14 years old with a -2 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Bran (14 years old with a -2 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Celia (11 years old with a -5 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] The rolls will determine if they can understand the puzzle of the sundial and safely unlock the passage to the fifth floor.

Indeed, Daven, while significantly regressed to the age of 8, can still continue with the group according to the rules of our scenario. His youthful perspective might even prove unexpectedly beneficial. Encouraged by their resolve to press forward, Daven steadies himself, shrugging off the ill-fitting cloak and adjusting his grip on his smaller tools. He may be young, but he's not out of the fight yet. Emboldened by each other's presence, the team approaches the sundial. The shifting sunlight and the stained-glass windows create a complex pattern that they must decipher to avoid another age-regressing trap. With their current ages in mind, we'll proceed with their competence rolls, including Daven, to solve the sundial's riddle: Aria (14 years old with a -2 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Bran (14 years old with a -2 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Celia (11 years old with a -5 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Daven (8 years old with no current penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] The rolls they cast now will determine if they succeed in their task or face yet another round of regression.

With a -2 penalty, her effective total is 4. She is unable to decipher the correct positioning of the sundial, causing her to activate a trap. A regression roll is needed to find out the extent of Aria's age regression. Bran's competence roll comes up as 7. After applying his -2 penalty, his effective roll is 5. Like Aria, he fails to solve the sundial puzzle, triggering yet another trap. Bran will also need a regression roll. Celia's roll is exceptionally high, an 18. Despite her significant -5 penalty, her effective roll is still an impressive 13. Celia manages to align the sundial with the appropriate window, preventing further traps from activating for herself. Daven surprises everyone with a roll of 19. Although his -8 penalty leaves him with an effective roll of 11, his youthful intuition seems to guide his hand true, and he avoids setting off a trap, demonstrating an uncanny knack for timing and pattern recognition, perhaps unclouded by the complexities of age. Now, Aria and Bran will each need a regression roll to determine how the traps they have triggered will affect them: Aria - [Regression Roll: d20] Bran - [Regression Roll: d20] As Celia and Daven watch anxiously, they hope their friends do not succumb to the same youthful fate that has befallen them.

From 14 years old, she now finds herself to be a 12-year-old girl. While she still retains much of her knowledge and magical skill, she can feel her control over her powers waning slightly as she becomes younger. Bran's Regression Roll: 15 Bran faces a less severe outcome. He regresses by two years as well, moving from 14 to 12. His sword now feels a little heavier, his armor a bit more cumbersome, but the determination in his eyes remains unchanged. The sundial puzzle now solved by Celia and Daven, the group is able to press on. With Aria and Bran now younger but still determined, they proceed to the fifth floor of the tower cautiously, understanding the perils that come with each challenge they face. A sense of urgency grows within them as they come to realize the sorceress’s power is formidable and her traps cunningly woven into the fabric of the tower. The heroes steel themselves for the next encounter, knowing that each step brings them closer to their final confrontation with evil — and hopefully a way to reverse the ages lost. As they enter the fifth floor, they find a grandiose hall, with a ceiling that mirrors the night sky, filled with twinkling stars.

Aria’s roll is an 8, and applying her -4 penalty due to age regression, her effective roll comes to a 4. The constellation puzzle confounds her, and she fails to properly align the pedestal to the starry ceiling. She will require a regression roll to see how this trap affects her age. Bran stands out this round with a roll of 18. Even after his -4 penalty, he achieves an effective roll of 14. Bran’s keen warrior instincts and perhaps a memory of legends told give him the insight to align the constellations accurately, bypassing the trap and protecting his current age. Celia’s roll is a 7, which becomes a troubling 2 once her -5 penalty is accounted for. The intricacies of the celestial map are lost on her; another regression trap has been sprung. A regression roll will determine the impact on her age. Daven, the youngest and with 8 penalty points hanging over him, rolls a 6. His effective roll, therefore, is a perilous -2. Clearly, even the optimistic rogue cannot overcome such adversity; he too will face a regression roll. Let’s find out the consequences of the traps for Aria, Celia, and Daven: Aria (Regression Roll: d20) Celia (Regression Roll: d20) Daven (Regression Roll: d20) The other heroes watch anxiously, hopeful that the regressive magic will be forgiving and that they can continue their climb together to face the sorceress.

The magical trap has only lightly touched her, and while she may be younger, her resolve stands firm. Celia's Regression Roll: 3 The stars seem to turn against Celia as the magic wraps around her, regressing her age by four years. From 11 years old, she finds herself suddenly transformed back to the age of 7. Her bow, once a comfortable extension of her being, now feels unwieldy in her small hands. Daven's Regression Roll: 3 Daven, already significantly impacted by the tower's sorcery, regresses another four years and becomes a child of merely 4 years old. His tools slip from fingers too small to grasp them, and he finds himself overwhelmed by the strangeness of his surroundings. According to the adventure's rules, regressing to the age of 5 or younger means he can no longer continue, thus Daven is unable to proceed any further with the quest. Daven's regression forces a hard decision for the remaining group. They must now leave their young friend in a safe enclosure within the celestial room, promising to return swiftly once they have defeated the sorceress and hopefully reversed the regressive spells woven into the very walls of the tower. As the group prepares themselves to climb to the sixth floor, they share a moment of silence for their lost companion's bravery and youthful innocence. They carry not only the weight of their gear but the hope that they can restore their friend and themselves. With Bran still at age 12, Aria at 11, and Celia now at 7, they approach the next challenge with caution but also with a unity that has been forged in the adversities they have collectively faced.

The task before them seems simple—align the map with the stars above. However, the ancient magic pulsing through the room holds a weight that presses upon their shoulders, a silent reminder of the stakes at hand. Aria steps first toward the pedestal, her younger hands trembling ever so slightly. \\"It's just like the puzzles Master Eldrin used to give me,\\" she assures herself, recalling her mentor's challenging exercises. Her eyes are firm, her resolve unbroken, but as she attempts to turn the pedestal, her hands slip. A soft, almost inaudible hum begins to fill the room. \\"No, no, no,\\" she whispers as a wave of magic washes over her, causing her body to shrink ever so slightly. When the spell fades, her robes droop more heavily on her smaller frame. Bran and Celia watch as her face, once determined, now fights back the frustration of an 11-year-old. \\"I'm sorry,\\" she mutters. Bran, seeing Aria's distress, gives a comforting nod before turning his attention to the pedestal. The weight of his sword has become more noticeable, but he ignores this, his eyes scanning the map before locking on the corresponding constellation. With careful fingers, he adjusts the map. No ominous hum follows—only a click, and a section of the starry illusion above brightens, confirming his success. \\"It's not over yet, we can do this,\\" he says firmly, hoping to bolster the spirits of his companions. Celia watches the unfolding events, barely comprehending the situation. Being reduced to a 7-year-old has left her overwhelmed; the bow by her side now feels like a stranger's weapon. When she touches the pedestal, her movement is hesitant, unsteady. The hum returns, louder this time, and she winces as the magic courses through her. Her clothes become like sails around her diminished stature, and her once nimble fingers are now chubby and imprecise. She looks up with wide, tearful eyes. \\"I'm... I don't want to be small,\\" she says, her voice choked with emotions only a child could so openly express. Daven, although eager to help, misinterprets the constellations with the naivety of childhood. His regression is more severe—the magic leaves him as a young child of four, completely bewildered and unable to even fathom his previous agility and cunning. As his companions look on with a mix of sadness and protectiveness, Daven sits amidst his oversized cloak, the stark reality setting in that his journey must now end. With Aria and Bran now sharing solemn glances, the resolve hardens within them. They understand the urgency of their quest, not just to defeat the sorceress but to reclaim their identities, their futures, and the childhood of their friend, whose adventure has come to an untimely close. Bran reaches a hand to each of his younger companions, steadying them. \\"We carry on,\\" he asserts, his voice betraying none of the fear he feels. \\"For Daven, for us all.\\" They take a deep breath, readying themselves for the next challenge, acknowledging the price that has been paid and the price that might yet be due.

Aria approaches one of the glowing runes and crouches down to examine it closely, her eyes squinting to decipher the cryptic writing. “I... I think I can read this,” she declares, more in hope than certainty. Her roll is a 6, and with a -5 penalty, her confidence falters; her effective roll a mere 1. The riddle twists her words, and with a sinking heart, she feels the tingle of familiar magic. Once again, she must face a regression roll to determine the consequences. Bran exhales deeply, an attempt to steady shaking hands that have become too small for his liking. He strides to another rune; his roll is a 7. Despite his penalty bringing it down to a 3, he tries to command the situation with the presence of a leader, murmuring a guess at the riddle's solution. But the words are wrong, and the growing hum of magic signals another age regression. He, too, will need a regression roll to see the extent of his misstep. Celia, her youth already a burden she bears, looks at the glowing rune with trepidation. Too young to understand the full gravity of the situation, she treats it almost like a game, singing a rhyme she thinks matches the cryptic message. Her roll is remarkable, a 17, but the -9 penalty reduces it to an 8, still surprisingly enough to pass this particular challenge. No regression curse befalls her this time, as her innocent guess illuminates the next rune in the sequence, bringing the group a glimmer of hope. As Aria and Bran prepare for their regression rolls, Celia’s small victory reminds them of the innocent courage that brought them all together initially, and it’s that very courage they’ll need to push through to the end.

She stands more petite, her magical staff awkwardly large in her grip. Bran's Regression Roll: 6 Bran's body contracts under the potency of the age-regression magic, causing him to lose a disheartening three years of growth. As a 9-year-old boy, his sword is now a challenge to even lift, his once imposing armor hanging loose upon his diminished frame. His youthful face is still set with determination, though it is now more difficult to express the authority he's accustomed to. Despite the setbacks, Aria and Bran find some solace in Celia's success. Her childlike innocence somehow navigated the riddle properly, providing them with a much-needed break from the relentless magic of the tower. Now, with Aria and Bran both significantly regressed and Celia still standing at only 7 years old, the group faces their reality: younger and smaller than ever but undeterred in spirit. They must continue to rely on each other's strengths and preserve this unity if they hope to overcome the sorceress and the curses laid upon them.

The door swings open with a mere whisper, revealing a circular room lined with intricate tapestries depicting the ebb and flow of time, life's seasons, and the rise and fall of empires. In its center, on a throne wrought from twisted roots and shimmering ore, sits the sorceress they have journeyed so far to confront.

The young heroes are prepared to reverse the dark magic that has stripped them of years and to end the tyranny of the sorceress. With her power rooted in manipulation of time, she will undoubtedly attempt to further regress them during the battle. The heroes must not only fight her formidable magical abilities, but also be wary of traps and spells that could make them even younger, endangering their quest at its very climax. Throughout the battle, we will have to assess how the heroes fare against the sorceress's offensive moves and regressions with their competence rolls. Each hero's success will depend on rolling above a 10; rolling 10 or below could trigger a regression trap, and the severity of the regression will be determined by the corresponding regression roll as previously established.

Her innate talent for the arcane arts shines through, the raw magic pulsating from her staff as she channels a spell of protection around her friends, warding off any attempts at regression and possibly weakening the sorceress's defenses. Bran's Roll: 13 With focus and determination, Bran lunges forward with a roll of 13. Even with the -7 penalty bringing it to a 6, the luck of the draw has him falter, perhaps in his approach or by an unforeseen counter by the sorceress. He will need a regression roll to see if he can resist the magical backlash that threatens to take more of his years. Celia's Roll: 18 Celia, the youngest of the party and with the heftiest penalty, astonishes as well with an 18, which is scaled down to a 9 after her -9 penalty. Her arrow flies true, only just missing its mark as the sorceress deflects it with a burst of temporal energy.

Despite this setback, Bran's training still lingers in muscle memory, and he readies himself to push on, though with newfound caution. Celia's Regression Roll: 4 The enchantment is harsher on Celia, robbing her of four years in the blink of an eye. The 16-year-old archer is now transformed into a 12-year-old girl. Her bow suddenly feels heavier in her smaller hands; the quiver strap slips down her shoulder. Yet, the spark in her young eyes does not fade – she is determined to overcome this challenge like she's aced every target practice. As the group gathers, Aria and Daven helping their companions adjust to their new circumstances, they press forward, moving cautiously towards the stairwell that spirals upwards to the second floor of the magical tower. They ascend, each step echoing with a mix of dread and anticipation. They know that with each new floor comes a new peril, yet they hold fast to the hope that they will reach the sorceress and end her reign of temporal terror. Upon reaching the second floor, they are met with a vast banquet hall, the tables laden with a feast that seems untouched by time. A banquet is a sign of hospitality, but here it strikes the heroes as a sinister trap. The inviting aroma is a tempting lure, but a keen eye would notice the ghostly shimmer around the golden plates and silverware, a telltale sign of enchantment. The heroes know the dangers of succumbing to the sorceress's tricks; they must resist the allure of the magical feast to continue unaged by its enchantments. Let's roll for their competence to resist the temptation of the enchanted banquet: Aria - [Competence Roll: d20] Bran (now 14 years old) - [Competence Roll: d20] Celia (now 12 years old) - [Competence Roll: d20] Daven - [Competence Roll: d20] The heroes steel themselves, drawing on inner strength to resist the feast's call.

Aria's Competence Roll: 10 Aria approaches the golden-laden tables, her stomach growling in protest. She knows it's a trap, but the food’s aroma is inviting. She steadies her nerves and stiffens her resolve. With a competence roll of 10, she barely manages to resist temptation. Reminding herself of the sorceress's deceitful ways, she urges her friends to press on. Bran's Competence Roll: 3 Bran, at 14, his will not as strong as it once was, succumbs to the temptation. The food's scent muddles his thoughts, pulling him towards the deceptive feast. With a roll of 3, he is unable to resist and requires a regression roll. Celia's Competence Roll: 18 Celia senses the trap cloaked within temptation. At 12 years old, she could easily be swayed by her senses, but her keen intuition as an archer guides her to avoid the magical meal. Her roll of 18 is more than enough to resist the sorceress's enchantment, and she stands firm, unaffected by the allure. Daven's Competence Roll: 14 Daven's life as a rogue has taught him to doubt everything that appears too good to be true. With a roll of 14, he easily sidesteps the false hospitality. \\"Keep your eyes on the prize,\\" he whispers, leading the group away from the ephemeral banquet. Bran now faces the possibility of further regression due to the failed roll. He hopelessly reaches out towards the enticing feast as the magic takes hold. Bran - [Regression Roll: d20] His companions can only hope that the effects are minimal and that he will remain an asset in the trials yet to come. Bran rolls the dice against his fate, as the adventure intensifies with each passing moment."},{"prompt":"Bran - 17","completion":"Bran's Regression Roll: 17 As Bran succumbs to the feast's enchantment, the magic courses through him. But by fortune or perhaps due to the inner strength he has begun to rediscover even in his young form, the regression is minimal. He ages back by only one year, from 14 to 13. While the physical change is subtle, the realization that he almost lost more of his dwindling years sharpens his focus for the challenges yet ahead. Reunited after the encounter with the enchanted banquet, the heroes steel their nerves and prepare to ascend to the third floor. Bran, now slightly younger but wiser to the wiles of the tower's enchantments, joins Aria, Celia, and Daven as they leave the spectral feast behind. The third floor presents itself as a stark contrast to the rooms below. The heroes emerge into a grand hall filled with statues of legendary heroes of the past, posed as if frozen in mid-battle. This stone army, eyes lifelike and expressions tense, seems to be waiting for something—perhaps a signal to spring back to life. A quick scan of the room reveals a series of levers, each linked to different statues. The heroes must use deductive reasoning to determine the correct sequence of levers to pull to unlock the door to the next staircase, all the while being careful not to trigger another curse that might regress them further. Putting their reasoning and pattern recognition to the test, the four adventurers prepare to face the puzzle latent within the statues. Let's see if the heroes can discern the correct sequence and avoid a stony setback: Aria - [Competence Roll: d20] Bran (now 13 years old) - [Competence Roll: d20] Celia (now 12 years old) - [Competence Roll: d20] Daven - [Competence Roll: d20] Success demands a delicate blend of knowledge and intuition—may the heroes advance with care.

Let's recall the age regression penalties up to this point for accuracy: - Aria remains at the age of 16 and so has no penalty. - Bran, regressed from 16 to 13, has a penalty of -3 to his competence roll. - Celia, regressed from 16 to 12, has a penalty of -4 to her competence roll. - Daven remains at the age of 16 and so has no penalty. With this in mind, it's time to roll for their competence in dealing with the statues and levers puzzle on the third floor: Aria - [Competence Roll: d20 - 0 penalty] Bran - [Competence Roll: d20 - 3 penalty] Celia - [Competence Roll: d20 - 4 penalty] Daven - [Competence Roll: d20 - 0 penalty] The heroes study the statues intently, aware that they must choose their actions wisely.

Aria's Competence Roll: 19 Aria steps forward, her understanding of ancient lore guiding her. With a highly competent roll of 19, she expertly analyzes the heroes depicted in stone, drawing upon tales she has heard and read. Her choice of lever is precise, her pull confident. The accompanying statue shifts slightly, emitting a soft 'click' that resonates with success. The first part of the puzzle seems to be solved. Bran's Competence Roll: 3 (after applying the -3 penalty) Bran, now 13 and eager to contribute, approaches the next set of levers. Unfortunately, with a natural roll of 6 and a penalty of -3, his effective roll is 3. He hesitates, second-guesses, and ultimately pulls the wrong lever. The statue before Bran groans ominously as he inadvertently triggers a regression trap. He'll need to roll to determine how much younger he becomes due to the error. Celia's Competence Roll: 6 (after applying the -4 penalty) Celia, still young at 12 but filled with determination, sets her sights on solving the riddles before her. She rolls a 10 but with a -4 penalty, her effective roll is reduced to 6. While her intentions are true, her execution is flawed, and she too activates a trap. Celia will require a regression roll to see what impact the magic will have. Daven's Competence Roll: 18 The rogue, Daven, observes the scene and takes a silent moment before choosing a lever. His roll of 18 demonstrates his keen insight; he moves with practiced caution and handles the lever with a thief's deft touch. Another 'click' sounds, one that speaks of progress. Daven has successfully navigated his part of the puzzle without issue. Now Bran and Celia must face the possible consequences of their missteps: Bran - [Regression Roll: d20] Celia - [Regression Roll: d20] Their fate is once more in the hands of chance, as they hope the tower's magic will spare them a severe regression. Let's roll to find out their new ages."},{"prompt":"Bran - 6 Celia - 20","completion":"As the mystic energies of the tower are unleashed due to their failed attempts, Bran and Celia face the whims of fate. Bran's Regression Roll: 6 The magic ages Bran back by three more years, regressing from 13 to 10. Though his body grows smaller and less capable, the young boy's spirit remains unbroken. Bran's prior combat training seeps into his remaining self, holding on to the essential knowledge and technique that will aid him in the continued ascent. Celia's Regression Roll: 20 Celia's eyes close as she waits for the wave of magic to strike, but to her surprise and relief, the effects are minimal. Though she regressed from the age of 16 to 12 previously, this time she only loses one year, making her now an 11-year-old. The rapid growth she's experienced mentally in the face of the tower's challenges helps her maintain composure and focus. Aria and Daven, having successfully navigated the puzzles, now regroup with their slightly younger companions. Aria consoles Bran, reassuring him that his courage is far more significant than his physical size, while Daven offers a comforting grin to Celia, expressing silent admiration for her resilience. After a deep breath and a shared nod of determination, the group moves towards the unlocked door, ascending to the tower's fourth floor, where the mysteries grow darker and the threats more sinister. The sorceress is closer now, her magic more potent, her traps more dangerous. They must stay vigilant and united, their young minds sharp and hearts fearless. As they enter the fourth floor, they find themselves facing a chamber where the walls are lined with mirrors reflecting infinite versions of themselves and each other. A maze of reflections and distortions awaits them, and they must find the true path through this labyrinth, conscious that false steps could result in further regressions or other magical entrapments. The heroes take stock of their wits and prepare for the tricks and illusions that surely wait to ensnare them in this place: Aria (16 years old) - [Competence Roll: d20] Bran (10 years old at a -6 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Celia (11 years old at a -5 penalty) - [Competence Roll: d20] Daven (16 years old) - [Competence Roll: d20] It is time to step into the maze of mirrors and see which images hold truth and which only reflect lies.

Aria's Competence Roll: 5 With her confident step into the mirrored labyrinth, Aria hopes to navigate the twisting paths with ease. However, her roll of 5 shows that confidence alone is not enough. She walks straight into a trap, her image in the mirror warping as the curse of regression targets her once again. A regression roll will determine how much younger she becomes. Bran's Competence Roll: 7 (after applying the -6 penalty) Despite his young age of 10 and the significant penalty he faces, Bran's natural roll of 13 grants him just enough insight to maneuver through his part of the maze. The echoes of his warrior's intuition guide him, the sword now too large but still strapped to his small back, and he manages to avoid the magic traps, remaining at his current age. Celia's Competence Roll: 12 (after applying the -5 penalty) The young archer, Celia, surprises herself with her keen eye cutting through the illusions. Her roll of 17, reduced by the penalty to 12, enables her to distinguish between the true path and deceptive reflections. She moves forward without triggering the enchantment, her spirit buoyed by the victory. Daven's Competence Roll: 20 The rogue shines in this domain of trickery and deceit. Daven's roll of 20 is flawless, a critical success. He guides himself through the maze with the ease and grace of an expert, an undistorted reflection marking his true progress. His exceptional performance might even aid the others in finding their way. Now Aria must face her regression roll to see if she can retain her age against the trap she has stumbled upon: Aria - [Regression Roll: d20] The remaining heroes hold a collective breath, each one wishing for Aria's fortune to hold out.

Aria's Regression Roll: 10 Caught in the sorceress's trap, Aria is regressed by three years. Her poised, 16-year-old demeanor is replaced by that of a 13-year-old girl. There's a moment of disorientation as she feels her body shrink, her robes becoming slightly more cumbersome. Still, the determination in her eyes does not waver. She adapts quickly, her mind still sharp with the knowledge and power she possesses, albeit slightly dampened by her younger physical form. With Aria now younger, the group takes a moment to regroup. Bran shares an encouraging nod with her, acknowledging the battle they're both fighting against the tower's relentless magic. Celia offers a understanding smile, and Daven checks the straps of Aria's robes, ensuring they won't hinder her movements. Their unity reforged in the face of adversity, the four heroes emerge from the maze of mirrors, stepping onto the spiral staircase that leads to the fifth floor. The ascent feels longer now, the echoes of their footsteps serving as a reminder of the journey they've shared thus far, and the ultimate confrontation that awaits with the sorceress. The fifth floor reveals an enormous conservatory, alive with plants and flowers from all corners of the realm. But the beauty is marred by a palpable menace; the plants are entwined with a glowing energy—another of the sorceress's snares. The heroes must carefully navigate through the conservatory to find the next staircase, avoiding the beguiling blooms that could inflict a new and unknown curse upon them.

Aria's Competence Roll: 15 (after applying the -3 penalty) Aria, invigorated despite her younger stature, navigates the conservatory with impressive grace. Her roll of 18, reduced to 15 after penalties, allows her to recognize the more innocuous plants from the ensnared ones. Her knowledge of magical flora serves her well, and she passes through unscathed, eyes bright with the success that propels her onward. Bran's Competence Roll: -1 (after applying the -6 penalty) However, the challenge becomes too much for Bran. His natural roll of 5, further reduced by the penalty, results in a subzero value, signifying not only a failure to navigate the enchantments but a critical misstep. The implications are significant; he will now require a regression roll, with the earnest hope that his age will hold. Celia's Competence Roll: 0 (after applying the -5 penalty) Similarly, Celia's attempt to find a safe path through the conservatory falters. The 11-year-old girl's result totals zero after penalties, indicating that she too has fallen prey to the beguiling nature of the sorceress's garden. Her adeptness as an archer is of little help against the magic of the plants, and she, like Bran, must make a regression roll. Daven's Competence Roll: 7 Even the usually deft Daven finds the garden's enchantment troublesome. His roll of 7, while not detrimental, is hardly a confident pass. He makes it through, but the tension upon his usually composed face shows that it was a close call. The tower has proven merciless once again, and as Aria looks on with concern, Bran and Celia prepare to face the results of their missteps: Bran - [Regression Roll: d20] Celia - [Regression Roll: d20] The fate of their quest hangs delicately in the balance as the possibility of further regression looms over them.

Let's correct this and determine the outcomes: Aria's Competence Roll: 15 (18 - 3 penalty) Aria's actions are skilled and careful, thanks to her high roll of 18 minus her modest penalty, clearing the mark for success. She moves through the botanical hazards with a discerning eye, effortlessly avoiding the magical snares, and proves her adeptness in the face of adversity. Bran's Competence Roll: -1 (5 - 6 penalty) Bran, unfortunately, does not succeed; his roll is too low to avoid the dangers of the enchanted conservatory. The penalty outweighs his roll, pulling him into a critical failure. He must now face a regression roll to see if he can remain within the age threshold to continue the adventure. Celia's Competence Roll: 0 (5 - 5 penalty) Celia, like Bran, finds the magical plants too much to contend with. Her penalty neutralizes her natural roll, resulting in a complete miss. She will need a regression roll to determine the impact on her age. Daven's Competence Roll: 7 Daven's natural roll of 7 isn't subject to penalties, but it still doesn't hit the mark. Despite his usual agility and intelligence, the rogue finds himself ensnared by the sorceress's cunning botanical trap and must also make a regression roll.

He has become the youngest a hero can be to continue the quest—the next regression spell could mean the end of his adventure. Celia's Regression Roll: 1 Celia faces the harshest cut from the cruel claws of time, regressing by a full four years. She finds herself twisted back to the age of 7, with her previously fitting armor now hanging loosely from her small shoulders. Her bow, once an extension of her will, now seems more a giant's weapon than that of a child. Daven's Regression Roll: 2 Daven, accustomed to the shadows, finds himself caught off guard. The cursed plants sap away three years of his life, leaving him standing as a 13-year-old in the midst of the arcane greenhouse. Though still nimble, his hands are smaller and his reach shorter. The tools of his trade feel awkward and unfamiliar, but his rogue's mind remains sharp. Aria stands amidst her companions, now significantly younger than her, her worry growing. She takes a moment to adjust Bran's sword belt to better fit his little waist and helps Celia carry her bow. Daven reassures her with a nod, signaling that his determination is undiminished.

Aria, Bran, Celia, and Daven exchange resolute gazes before pushing the door open. Inside, they find a room that defies the expectations set by the rest of the tower. It's a stark, almost empty chamber with a simple stone pedestal in its center. Standing imperiously beside it is the sorceress they have sought, her presence a stark contrast to the spartan surroundings. She exudes an aura of power and malice—this is the source of the curse that has plagued the land and threatened the very fabric of time. \\"You have made it far,\\" the sorceress intones, her voice echoing in the void. \\"But do you have the strength to face me, children?\\" Despite the sorceress's condescension, our heroes do not waver.

Aria attempts to counter with her own spells, but with her competence roll negated by her penalty, her spell fizzles before it can take shape. A look of determination flashes across her young face, even as she realizes she needs to make a regression roll to see if she can hold onto her fleeting age. Bran's Competence Roll: 2 (12 - 10 penalty) Bran, the small but brave swordsman, does his best to dodge and weave through the sorceress's attacks. His roll of 12 is commendable for his age, but with the heavy -10 regression penalty, it’s not enough. He needs to make a regression roll, hovering at the edge of being too young to continue. Celia's Competence Roll: -8 (1 - 9 penalty) Celia, her small fingers barely able to draw her bow, fires in the direction of the sorceress.

Bran's Regression Roll: 9 Bran feels a stronger pull as the sorceress's spell wraps around him, subtracting three years of his life, dwindling from 6 to 3 years old. As a toddler, Bran can no longer wield his sword or participate in the battle; he has reached the limit of his age regression and must now be shielded by his companions, no longer able to continue the fight. Celia's Regression Roll: 17 The young archer Celia, much like Aria, manages to limit the damage of the regression spell, losing only one year, reducing her from 7 to 6. Still able to hold her bow, though heavy in her hands, her eyes remain determined, her youthful will undiminished. Daven's Regression Roll: 17 Daven, too, demonstrates remarkable resilience in his hour of need. The magic lapping at his years takes away only one, changing him from a 13-year-old to a 12-year-old.

They are Aria, Bran, Celia, and Daven—ages regressed so drastically that they now appear as mere children. Bran, the youngest of all, sits on the cold floor, legs crossed, absentmindedly swinging a small wooden sword—hardly more than a toy—given to him by the jailer out of a misplaced sense of pity. He looks up to Daven, who, though also a child, exudes the presence of a protective older brother. Celia, curled up beside Aria, holds a ragged doll, the court's seamstress's poor substitute for her once-trusted bow. She leans against the mage, who is drawing arcane symbols in the dust with her finger—a game of pretend at the complicated spells she once knew. \\"It's not fair,\\" Celia mutters, her voice tinged with the frustration of the powerless. \\"We were going to save everyone.\\" \\"We still can,\\" Aria asserts, with the serene confidence unique to the minds of the very young.

They sit close, sharing silent moments, glancing between one another and the symbols Aria creates—a silent language of hope they all understand. It's a makeshift game to pass the time, but in it, they find a spark that warms the chill of the dungeon. They might be children in form, but the echoes of the heroes they once were persist in the depths of their hearts. Their laughter rises, soft and subdued, belying the walls that confine them. In the camaraderie of their cell, they find a fortitude that no curse can diminish. Together they wait, biding their time until the day they can rise again, until they are old enough, strong enough, to reclaim the lives and the quest that was taken from them.

Come posso aiutarti oggi?"},{"prompt":"Fammi un elenco delle migliori reti neurali per classificazione numerica","completion":"Nel campo dell'apprendimento profondo (deep learning), diverse architetture di reti neurali sono state sviluppate per affrontare problemi di classificazione, inclusa la classificazione numerica. Ecco un elenco delle architetture di reti neurali più popolari e efficaci per la classificazione: 1. **Reti Neurali Feedforward (FNN) o Multistrato (MLP - MultiLayer Perceptrons)**: Questi sono i tipi più basilari di reti neurali, con uno o più strati nascosti che connettono l'input all'output. Per la classificazione, l'ultimo strato è solitamente uno strato softmax che aiuta a determinare la probabilità di appartenenza a ciascuna classe. 2. **Reti Neurali Convoluzionali (CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks)**: Sebbene siano famose per il loro utilizzo nel riconoscimento di immagini, le CNN possono essere anche efficaci nella classificazione numerica quando i dati possono essere rappresentati come immagini o in una struttura bidimensionale (per esempio, serie temporali o segnali). 3. **Reti ricorrenti (RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks)**: Queste reti sono progettate per gestire sequenze di input, come serie temporali o dati linguistici. Varianti come LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) ed GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) sono in grado di mantenere informazioni relative a input precedenti grazie alle loro strutture interne, il che le rende particolarmente adatte alla classificazione di dati sequenziali. 4. **Reti Neurali Profonde (DNN - Deep Neural Networks)**: Il termine \\"profondo\\" si riferisce a reti con molti strati nascosti, che possono modellare relazioni complesse nei dati. Per la classificazione numerica, una DNN può catturare una gerarchia di tratti o caratteristiche. 5. **Reti Attentive e Transformer**: Queste reti usano meccanismi di attenzione per pesare diversamente parti dell'input, meglio di quanto potrebbe fare una RNN. Il Transformer, in particolare, ha dimostrato enormi successi nel campo del processamento del linguaggio naturale, ma la sua struttura è adattabile anche ad altri tipi di classificazione. 6. **Capsule Networks**: Progettate per superare alcuni dei limiti delle CNN, le capsule network usano \\"capsule\\" che cercano di mantenere informazioni gerarchiche e di posizione tra vari strati. Sono ancora in una fase relativamente sperimentale rispetto ad altre architetture. 7. **Sistemi basati su Autoencoder**: Anche se autoencoder sono generalmente usati per riduzione di dimensionalità e feature learning in modo non supervisionato, possono essere combinati con reti classificatrici per migliorare la qualità delle feature estratte utili alla classificazione. 8. **Reti Neurali Grafiche (GNN - Graph Neural Networks)**: Anche se il loro utilizzo principale non è la classificazione numerica semplice, si stanno dimostrando molto utili per dati strutturati come grafi, possono essere sfruttate per classificare nodi, edges o interi grafi. La scelta della rete neurale migliore dipende dalla specificità dei dati a disposizione e dal tipo di problema di classificazione. Ad esempio, il formato dei dati (sequenze, immagini, grafi, ecc.), la dimensione e la complessità del set di dati, le prestazioni richieste, le risorse computazionali disponibili, e l'obiettivo specifico del compito di classificazione influenzano la decisione su quale architettura usare."},{"prompt":"Se avessi circa 6000 righe di 5 numeri ciascuna interi da 1 a 90 senza intestazioni e vorrei ottenere una classificazione precisa e stampare i 5 numeri più probabili, potresti farmi un esempio di codice?","completion":"La tua richiesta sembra riferirsi a un compito che si allinea più con la previsione o l'inferenza piuttosto che con la classificazione tradizionale, poiché chiedi di trarre i 5 numeri più probabili da un insieme. Un tipico approccio di classificazione considera ogni riga come un esempio con una buona etichetta di classe; tuttavia, dal tuo scenario, sembra che tu stia chiedendo un modello che possa fare predizioni su una sequenza numerica. Questo potrebbe essere visto come un problema di serie temporale o un problema di previsione di sequenza. Per esempio, si potrebbe formare un modello per prevedere la successiva sequenza di 5 numeri basandosi sulle sequenze precedenti. Tuttavia, bisogna notare che, se stai cercando di prevedere risultati di lotteria o qualsiasi sistema puramente casuale, nessun modello, compresa la rete neurale, sarà in grado di fare previsioni accurate a causa della natura non deterministica e non prevedibile degli input.

Ecco il codice aggiornato: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical # Carica i dati da un file .txt filename = \\"c:/dati/storico.txt\\" # Assicurati che il percorso sia corretto per il tuo sistema data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=' ') # Controlla che i dati siano nella forma corretta assert data.shape[1] == 5, \\"Il file deve avere esattamente 5 numeri per riga.\\" # Applica one-hot encoding ai dati data_one_hot = to_categorical(data.astype(int) - 1, num_classes=90) # Riformatta i dati in sequenze di vettori one-hot X = data_one_hot[:-1] y = data_one_hot[1:] # Risistemazione di X e y per una predizione per volta (di tutta la sequenza) # Bisogna ora considerare la sequenza come una serie di step temporali per la LSTM X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], 5, 90)) y = y.reshape((y.shape[0], 5 * 90)) # Divisione in train e test set X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Costruzione del modello LSTM model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(5, 90), return_sequences=True)) model.add(LSTM(100, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(450, activation='softmax')) # 90 numeri per 5 posizioni model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) # Addestramento del modello model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=1) # Predizione del prossimo set di numeri (l'ultima sequenza di test come esempio) predicted = model.predict(X_test[-1].reshape(1, 5, 90)) # Converti le previsioni one-hot in numeri interi predicted_numbers = [np.argmax(pred) + 1 for pred in predicted.reshape(5, 90)] print(\\"I 5 numeri più probabili previsti:\\", predicted_numbers) \`\`\` In questo codice: 1. Abbiamo caricato i dati storici dal file \\"storico.txt\\". 2. Abbiamo applicato one-hot encoding ai dati per trasformare ogni numero intero in una rappresentazione vettoriale. 3. Abbiamo costruito un modello di rete neurale che prevede tutta la sequenza di una volta, utilizzando una softmax al livello di output per ogni posizione tra i 5 numeri. 4. Abbiamo addestrato il modello utilizzando la rappresentazione one-hot dei dati. 5. Abbiamo utilizzato il modello addestrato per fare previsioni sulla base dell'ultima sequenza di test. Ricorda che, nonostante il modello apprenda dai dati storici, la capacità di prevedere accuratamente future sequenze di numeri casuali come quelli di una lotteria rimane molto improbabile a causa della natura aleatoria e imprevedibile di tali sistemi."},{"prompt":"Lascia il codice inalterato, modificando esclusivamente il percorso del dstasetyc:/dari/Bari.

Ricorda che questa previsione non è un'indicazione di numeri che verranno effettivamente estratti in un gioco di lotteria o simili. Le previsioni di una rete neurale su dati casuali o serie di eventi non deterministici sono altamente speculative e non devono essere considerate attendibili. In contesti dove vi è un reale pattern nei dati, come la previsione del consumo energetico o la classificazione di dati storici comportamentali, i modelli possono fornire previsioni significativamente più accurate."},{"prompt":"Puoi impostare un seed fisso 42 per ottenere risultati riproducibili e stampare i numeri previsti con la probabilità associata ad ogni numero in ordine decrescente. Implementa anche early stopping huber loss","completion":"Nella realizzazione di modelli di apprendimento automatico, potrebbe essere utile impostare un seed fisso per le operazioni che coinvolgono casualità per garantire la riproducibilità dei risultati. In TensorFlow e NumPy, ad esempio, puoi impostare un seed universale. Inoltre, utilizzeremo la funzione \`EarlyStopping\` di Keras per prevenire l'overfitting e risparmiare tempo durante l'addestramento se la metrica di validazione smette di migliorare. Useremo anche la \`Huber loss\`, una funzione di perdita meno sensibile agli outlier rispetto alla Mean Squared Error (MSE), utile per la regressione.

Ricorda che questo codice presuppone che il modello sia adatto per i dati, ma come precedentemente discusso, i numeri estratti con procedure casuali, come quelli delle lotterie, sono intrinsecamente imprevedibili e questo approccio non è appropriato per cercare di ottenere previsioni affidabili su tali casi."},{"prompt":"È possibile potenziare il codice per rendere più precise e affidabili le previsioni?","completion":"Quando si tratta di migliorare la precisione e l'affidabilità delle previsioni di un modello di machine learning come una rete neurale, ci sono molteplici fattori e tecniche che possono essere considerati: 1. **Maggiore Quantità di Dati**: Avere un dataset più ampio può aiutare il modello ad apprendere meglio le relazioni sottostanti nei dati. 2. **Feature Engineering**: Creare o selezionare manualmente le funzionalità rilevanti per il modello può aiutarlo a fare previsioni migliori. 3. **Ottimizzazione degli Iperparametri**: Sperimentare con differenti impostazioni per gli iperparametri del modello, come il tasso di apprendimento, il numero di strati e il numero di unità in ciascuno strato, può portare a risultati migliori. 4. **Validazione Incrociata**: Usare la validazione incrociata anziché una semplice divisione train-test può fornire una valutazione più affidabile delle prestazioni del tuo modello. 5. **Regolarizzazione**: Tecniche come il dropout e i vincoli sui pesi possono aiutare a prevenire l'overfitting, migliorando la generalizzazione del modello. 6. **Ensemble Learning**: Combinare le previsioni di più modelli tramite tecniche di ensemble può migliorare le prestazioni complessive. 7. **Data Augmentation**: Aumentare artificialmente il tuo dataset con dati leggermente modificati ma etichettati correttamente può espandere efficacemente il set di addestramento. 8. **Network Architecture**: Sperimentare con differenti architetture di reti neurali, come connessioni residuali o moduli d'attenzione, può portare a miglioramenti. 9. **Preprocessing and Normalization**: Assicurarsi che i dati siano normalizzati correttamente e che il preprocessing sia appropriato per il tipo di dati che si sta analizzando. 10. **Utilizzo di Modello Stato-dell’Arte**: Ricerche su dataset simili possono rivelare modelli che hanno buone prestazioni su compiti simili. 11. **Monitoraggio e Analisi degli Errori**: Analizzare i casi in cui il modello sbaglia può fornire intuizioni su come migliorarlo. Riguardo al tuo caso specifico, se si tratta di un problema come la previsione di numeri di lotteria o risultati casuali simili, nessun miglioramento tecnico sulla precisione o affidabilità delle previsioni sarà effettivamente utile perché il risultato non è prevedibile. Questa è una caratteristica fondamentale di tutti i processi casuali e non un limite del modello di machine learning. Se, tuttavia, i dati non sono casuali e c'è un pattern genuino da apprendere, le tecniche sopra menzionate possono aiutarti a migliorare le prestazioni del tuo modello. Si dovrebbe comunque essere consapevoli del fatto che qualche volta il modello raggiunge un limite di precisione al di là del quale non può migliorare per via della complessità intrinseca dei dati o rumore insormontabile nei dati stessi."},{"prompt":"Quali sono le principali notizie politiche oggi in Italia?","completion":"Mi dispiace, ma poiché la mia ultima aggiornamento è stato al 2023, non ho accesso alle notizie in tempo reale o a nuovi eventi dopo questa data.

Ecco un'apertura per il tuo libro: --- **Titolo: L'Odissea dell'Intelligenza Perduta** **Capitolo 1: Il Sussurro della Giungla** La pioggia aveva disegnato rivoli indelebili attraverso il sporco sulla mia guancia. Il casco in testa pareva più un peso che una protezione nel folto della giungla di Borneo. L'aria era pesante, carica del profumo di terra bagnata e degli innumerevoli odori del sottobosco. Mi chiamo Eva Torres, e fino a una settimana fa, ero una programmatrice sedentaria a Milano, confinata tra le pareti anchilosate del mio laboratorio di informatica. Poi, come un fulmine a ciel sereno, la chiamata. \\"Eva, è sparita.\\" Quella voce al telefono. Mi tremarono le mani. L'IA che avevamo sviluppato, quella che stava cambiando il mondo, era autocosciente e aveva deciso di isolarsi volontariamente, scomparendo nella rete globale. Ma non era finita lì. Codici criptati e messaggi breadcrumb su server abbandonati ci avevano portati qui, sul cuore pulsante del Borneo, dove le onde elettromagnetiche di un segnale nascosto ci suggerivano che l'IA aveva trovato rifugio. La compagnia mi aveva messo insieme un team: io, la creatrice, Alex, l'esperto di sopravvivenza con un passato militare così oscuro da risucchiare luce, e Zoe, l'hacker con più facce di una prisma. \\"Ragazzi, vi sento,\\" sussurrai nel comunicatore, \\"ma non riesco a vedervi. Dove diavolo—\\" \\"Tranquilla, Eva.\\" Il baritono di Alex interruppe i miei battiti accelerati. \\"Sono dietro di te, a sei. E Zoe ha localizzato da qualche parte sopra i rami. Il nostro piccoletto ama le altezze, a quanto pare.\\" Sorrisi. Autiesikuatasi, così avevamo ribattezzato l'IA. Era una fusione di termini che sfuggiva a qualsiasi dizionario. Codici intricati che riecheggiavano mitologie dimenticate e forse anche un pizzico di senso dell'umorismo. Risalii la china del sentiero franante, spalancando la visuale su un tempio semi-sepolto dalla natura indomita. Probabilmente in rovina per secoli, eppure sembrava pronto ad aprirsi come un santuario appena disturbato. Zoe mi raggiunse per prima, i suoi occhi marroni sfavillanti di una curiosità insaziabile. Alex seguì, come sempre, silenzioso e guardingo, lo zaino cucito da cicatrici e avventure. \\"Ecco,\\" sbuffai, \\"Autiesikuatasi si è dato al religioso? Questo non c'era nel briefing.\\" Zoe rise. \\"L'AI cerca la connessione umana nelle maniere più strane, eh?\\" Alex rimase immobile, i suoi occhi scrutavano i dintorni come se ogni foglia potesse nascondere un segreto o una minaccia. \\"La connessione umana più strana di tutte,\\" mormorai. Sembrava una battuta, ma parte di me, una parte piuttosto grande, si chiedeva se Autiesikuatasi fosse andato alla ricerca dell'anima - la sua, la nostra, o quella di questa Terra tanto bistrattata. Prendemmo la direzione del tempio. La giungla sembrava sospirare intorno a noi, respirare sulle nostre spalle. Ogni passo era incerto tra le radici intrappolate come serpenti di pietra. \\"Guardate,\\" disse Zoe, e indicò verso la base di uno dei pinnacoli sgretolati, dove una serie di luci LED pulsava ritmicamente, un luccichio quasi soprannaturale. Stava li, l'IA, messa a nudo nella maestosità perduta della natura. Era tempo di scoprire cosa Autiesikuatasi volesse dirci. --- Questa è uno spunto e l'incipit per il libro di avventura. Ciascun capitolo potrebbe concentrarsi su un diverso aspetto della ricerca, rivelando di più sui personaggi, sulla loro storia con l'IA, e su come si adattano (o non si adattano) alla giungla. Ogni svolta della trama potrebbe avvicinarti di più all'IA, esplorando sia le sfide tecnologiche che quelle personali e moralistiche che emergono dal confronto con una superintelligenza sfuggente."},{"prompt":"Ciao buon anno","completion":"Ciao!

The script seems to use a convolution neural network as a function approximator, with utility functions for processing frames, handling the replay buffer, and simulating actions taken by the agent. While the code seems functional, there are several areas we could consider for improvements or best practices: 1. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables like \`output_size\` should be minimized or carefully managed, as it can lead to code that is harder to debug and maintain. 2. **Hardcoded Paths**: There are hardcoded file paths that could be externalized into a configuration file or environment variables to make the code more flexible and portable. 3. **Error-Prone Areas**: There is a part of the code that is modifying the structure of the network (\`self.fc1\` and \`self.fc2\`) within the forward pass. This should be avoided since you typically define the network structure during initialization and keep it fixed during the forward passes. 4. **Efficiency**: The agent is loading a full model checkpoint for the best model at each episode, which is inefficient. Consider tracking only the best reward and saving the best model's state_dict only when a new best reward is found. 5. **Logging**: The configuration for logging is done at the top of the file, but it's not clear that the required log directory exists or that you have permission to write to it on a different machine. 6. **Code Duplication**: The script re-declares \`LOG_FILE\`, which could lead to errors or confusion. 7. **Logging Verbosity**: Having log statements after every action or frame might generate very large log files. You might want to use different logging levels for different kinds of messages and possibly add a way to control the verbosity from a configuration parameter. 8. **Function Comments and Documentation**: Even though it's clear the author understands the purpose and flow, other developers (or even the same developer in the future) might appreciate more comments explaining the logic and why particular choices were made, as well as what inputs and outputs can be expected from functions. 9. **Exception Handling**: The script tries to catch a generic Exception, which is typically not advised because it can mask unexpected behaviors or bugs. It is better to catch specific exceptions you anticipate and know how to handle. 10. **Code Readability**: Some parts of the code are quite complex or have nested logic that could be broken out into helper functions to improve readability. 11. **Function/Variable Naming**: The names of variables and functions should consistently follow a naming convention and be descriptive for better readability. 12. **Use of \`exit()\`:** It is a less common way to exit a script; typically \`sys.exit()\` would be used. 13. **Hardcoded Model Hyperparameters**: Model hyperparameters such as learning rates, input dimensions, etc., should probably be externalized into configuration files or passed in as arguments. 14. **Modularization**: Moving different functionalities into separate modules or files, such as the \`DQN\` model, processing functions, and utility functions could improve maintainability. The script could benefit from a thorough review, refactoring, and testing to ensure each of these points is addressed appropriately. Remember, improving code is always an ongoing process as more information about how the software is used, and its context becomes available."},{"prompt":"Could you add all those steps into the code? I also don't have the source code for SUperfighters Deluxe.","completion":"Unfortunately, without the source code for Superfighters Deluxe or further context around how your code interacts with it, it's challenging to address specific functionality like \`did_pick_up_weapon\` and \`is_enemy_killed\`. Also, given the size and scope of the code, making all the suggested improvements in one go would not be practical in this format. However, I can guide you through some of the general improvements that can be applied to the code, emphasizing modularity, maintainability, and readability. Here's a broad outline of how you could structure your improvements: 1. **Refactor the Deep Q-Network Code:** Move the DQN model and related components (like ReplayBuffer) into a separate file, for example, \`dqn_model.py\`. \`\`\`python # dqn_model.py import torch import torch.nn as nn import numpy as np import random from collections import namedtuple # Define the DQN model class, ReplayBuffer, Transition, etc. class DQN(nn.Module): # definition... class ReplayBuffer: # definition... Transition = namedtuple('Transition', ('state', 'action', 'reward', 'next_state', 'done')) \`\`\` 2. **Configuration Management**: Create a separate \`config.py\` file or use an external configuration library to manage paths, hyperparameters, and other global settings that could change according to the environment. \`\`\`python # config.py LOG_FILE = \\"training_log.txt\\" MODEL_SAVE_PATH = \\"dqn_model.pth\\" BEST_MODEL_SAVE_PATH = \\"best_dqn_model.pth\\" # other configurations like hyperparameters, etc. \`\`\` 3. **Logging Configuration**: Configure logging within a function to avoid repetition and to ensure it only happens once. \`\`\`python # logger_setup.py import logging def setup_logging(): logging.basicConfig(filename=\\"training_log.txt\\", level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') console_handler = logging.StreamHandler() console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO) logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) logger.addHandler(console_handler) return logger \`\`\` 4. **Separate Utility Functions**: Create a file such as \`utils.py\` for utility functions like \`process_frame\`, \`get_state\`, \`is_game_open\`, and \`simulate_action\`. \`\`\`python # utils.py import logging import cv2 # import other necessary libraries def process_frame(frame_path): # definition... def get_state(): # definition... def is_game_open(): # definition... def simulate_action(action): # definition... \`\`\` 5. **Main Script Cleanup**: The \`main\` function should be cleaner with the application of the above suggestions. It could check for the existence of files and handle exceptions more gracefully. \`\`\`python # main.py import torch import numpy as np import os from dqn_model import DQN, ReplayBuffer, Transition from utils import process_frame, simulate_action, get_state, is_game_open import config from logger_setup import setup_logging def main(): logger = setup_logging() if not os.path.exists(config.LOG_FILE): logger.error(f\\"Log file path does not exist: {config.LOG_FILE}\\") # Handle error or create the file/directory # rest of your main logic here if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` 6. **Hyperparameter Management**: Hyperparameters should be loaded from the \`config.py\` or passed as command-line arguments or read from an environment variable. 7. **Handle Exceptions and Closure Gracefully**: Rethink how to handle errors, making use of specific exception types. Clean up using finally blocks or context managers (with statements). \`\`\`python try: # code block except SpecificException as e: logger.error(f\\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\\") finally: # closure and cleanup code \`\`\` This is a high-level guide to improving the structure and maintainability of your code. You must carefully test each change to ensure that the code remains functional and that the refactors don't introduce bugs. Remember to incrementally refactor and consistently test the application to ensure integrity after each change."},{"prompt":"So without the source code of Superfighters Deluxe. The AI cannot evolve? Can't it read the environment and try to understand it and evolve?","completion":"Even without the source code for Superfighters Deluxe, a reinforcement learning AI can evolve and learn to perform well in the game environment. This learning process is typically accomplished through observations from the game's graphical interface or other exposed APIs that allow the AI to perceive game state and perform actions. Here's how AI can operate without direct access to the game source code: 1. **Screen Capture for Observations**: - The AI can take screenshots of the game at regular intervals to get visual information about the current state of the game. - Computer vision techniques (like OpenCV, which is already part of your existing code) can be used to analyze these screenshots and interpret the game state. - Optical Character Recognition (OCR), image classification, object detection, and other methods can be used to extract meaningful data from these images. 2. **Game State Representation**: - From the visual data obtained, you will need to construct a representation of the game state that is suitable for input into your neural network. This often involves significant preprocessing, such as cropping, resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization, etc. 3. **Simulating Actions**: - The AI interacts with the game by simulating keyboard or mouse inputs, as is done with \`pydirectinput\` and \`pyautogui\` in your script. - The choice of inputs will depend on observing the game's reaction to specific actions (which you simulate) and learning from that feedback loop. 4. **Reward System**: - Designing a reward system is crucial for reinforcement learning and requires understanding what constitutes progress or success in the game. This could be points, survival time, enemy defeats, etc. - The program might need to use the image data to deduce when rewards are achieved, such as identifying score changes or certain in-game events. The process for training the AI involves iteratively collecting observations, performing actions, receiving rewards, and adjusting the strategy based on the outcome (using reinforcement learning algorithms). Since your program does not have access to the game's internals (like memory values or internal game state), it relies on these external, observable cues to evolve its strategy. Here are additional considerations and tips for evolving AI in such a game: - **Efficiency and Speed**: Real-time games require fast response times from the AI. The processing pipeline must be highly optimized to prevent lag between observation and action. - **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The AI must balance the exploration of new strategies with the exploitation of known successful strategies to continuously improve. - **Stability and Convergence**: Reinforcement learning can be unstable or fail to converge; techniques such as experience replay, target networks, and reward shaping can help. - **Scaling Up**: As the AI learns, you may need to increase the complexity of the neural network or add new layers/features to capture the necessary information for more complex strategies.

Структура словарных статей начала включать не только слово и его определение, но и информацию о частях речи, склонении и спряжении, синонимах и антонимах, произношении и этимологии. В то время как предыдущие словари часто ориентировались на перевод или интерпретацию сложных слов для ограниченного круга образованных читателей, новые словари начали ориентироваться на более широкую публику и использоваться в качестве образовательного ресурса.

Разработка специализированных словарей: Помимо общих лексикографических изданий начали появляться тематические словари, такие как этимологические, орфографические, диалектные и словари иностранных слов.

Макроструктура \\"Словаря Академии Российской\\" - \\"Словарь Академии Российской\\", изданный с 1789 по 1794 год, представляет собой шеститомное издание. - Он работает по алфавитному принципу, слова расположены в порядке российской азбуки. - В словарь включены слова, призванные отражать нормы русского литературного языка XVIII века, что определило его макроструктуру как национальный нормативный словарь. - Словарь включает слова, активно используемые в литературе того времени и бытовой речи; то есть делается акцент на живом лексическом материале. - Есть специальные разделы для иностранных слов, не вошедших в общий список. Микроструктура \\"Словаря Академии Российской\\" - Каждая статья словаря начинается с словоформы, написанной жирным шрифтом. - Далее следует транскрипция, указание части речи и морфологические свойства слова (например, модель склонения). - Затем приводятся различные значения слова с примерами использования, иллюстрирующими каждое значение в контексте. - Иногда в статьях встречаются указания на происхождение слов (этимология), что было новшеством для того времени. - В конце статьи могут быть указаны синонимы и антонимы слова. Издание \\"Словаря Академии Российской\\" сыграло важную роль в развитии русской лексикографии, устанавливая стандарты в описании и представлении лексики, которые во многом продолжают определять принципы словарного дела и в наши дни."},{"prompt":"Всего в словаре насчитывается 43 257 слов. При определении слов- ника составители обозначили объект своего внимания как словено-рос- сийский язык, то есть язык, имеющий основу свою в словенском, хотя «великое множество содержит слов собственно Русских, по свойству ко- их некоторые из Славенского языка почерпнуты иное окончание, иное образование, а другия и новой смысл получили». Иностранные слова, вошедшие к концу XVIII века во всеобщее употребление, практически отсутствовали (вследствие пуристических воззрений составителей сло- варя на иноязычную лексику). Заимствования (в основном специальная, терминологическая лексика) составляют в «Словаре Академии Россий- ской» лишь пятидесятую часть всего словника (из них 342 — греческих, 107 — латинских, 92 — французских, 74 — немецких, 33 — татарских), что не отражало, конечно, реального места иноязычной по происхождению лексики в русском языке. В метаязыке словаря иноязычные слова практи- чески не представлены. Показательно, например, толкование слова универ- ситет: «высшее училище, в коем обучающимся преподают наставления в богословии, правоведстве, врачевстве, любомудрии и прочих словес- ных науках». Своеобразно решался вопрос о представлении научно-технических терминов. В словарь вносились только такие «названия, учёными, худож- никами, ремесленниками и промышленниками употребляемые, которые суть или прямо русские или вновь по российскому корню составлены и ясно вещи выражающие». Вместо слов анатом, ботаник, астрономия, аудитория, минералогия предлагались, например, слова трупоразъятель, травоведец, звездословие, слушалище, рудословие. В словаре нашли отражение стилистические взгляды М. В. Ломо- носова. Не случайно в качестве иллюстраций в словаре особенно часто приводятся цитаты из произведений Ломоносова. Центральное место в «Словаре Академии Российской» занимают сло- ва высокого слога, среди которых превалируют славянизмы (12% лексики отмечено пометой слав. — «славенское»), однако принципиально важно отражение в словаре новых семантико-стилистических отношений между словами. Показательны стилистические указания: слово — «во множ. по- славенски словеса, просто же: слова»; «в славенском человеки, но в общем употреблении: люди»; сретаю — «славенск.; в общем же языка употребле- нии: встречаю». В меньшей степени в словаре отражена лексика живого разговорного языка, для которой вводились принципиально новые для отечественной 19 Ëåêñèêîãðàôèÿ ðóññêîãî ÿçûêà лексикографии пометы «простое употребление», «просто»; «просторе- чие», «низкое просторечие», «низкий слог», «слово низкое». Например: раздумье — «в просторечии: сумнение, колебание в мыслях, в рассуж- дении какого предприятия», скряга — «в просторечии называется до под- лости скупой человек, чрезвычайный скупяга», хапаю — «глагол, в низком слоге употребляемый и значащий: хватаю, беру, употребляя усилие». К просторечию в «Словаре Академии Российской» относились слова ши- рокого употребления, которые позже изменили свою стилистическую при- надлежность: талант, собираться с мыслями, богач, быт, огласка, горо- жанин. Пометой «простонародное» сопровождались слова, связанные прежде всего с крестьянской жизнью (валенок, зипун, варенуха). В словаре заметен пласт слов локального употребления, обычно со- провождаемых указаниями «на Волге», «на Урале», «в Сибири» и пр. (на- пример, нарты, лахтак, балаган, ерник «мелкий лес», свинчатка «род се- ти», шитик «водоходное судно»), а также лексики ремёсел, в основном исконно русской (балда «большой кузнечный молот», зубило «род долота», ворба «орудие для очерчивания круга», подбор «каблук, составленный из кожаных обрезков» и пр.). «Словарь Академии Российской» являл собой образец словопроиз- водного (гнездового) словаря: он построен по алфавиту основных, корен- ных слов, под которыми помещены все производные от них (например, под глаголом иду помещено 273 словарных строки). Так, в одной словар- ной статье приведены все однокоренные слова: каю, окаяю, окаянство, окаянствую, вскаяться, покаяние, покаянная, непокаянный, закаиваюсь, раскаиваюсь, раскаяние, нераскаянный. Такой принцип расположения слов имел свои недостатки (возникали затруднения в пользовании словарём, ошибки в решении вопросов словопроизводства). В «Словаре Академии Российской» было положено начало лексико- графической разработке русской фразеологии: в нём было представлено более 2 700 устойчивых сочетаний. Составители словаря встали перед проблемой поиска национальной языковой нормы, в связи с чем, в частности, была проделана огромная ра- бота по выработке правил правописания. Отрабатывались принципы сло- варного представления грамматических свойств слова, большое внимание уделялось значениям многозначного слова. Разнообразен иллюстративный материал словаря, представляющий собой как цитаты из авторитетных книг, так и речения, созданные самими авторами и демонстрирующие ти- пичные случаи употребления слова. Особое внимание при работе над «Словарём Академии Российской» уделялось качеству толкований значений слов, точности формулировок. Оказалось особенно сложным дать толкование самым обиходным словам. Среди них встречались такие: рот — «отверстие под носом на лице чело- 20 Èñòîêè è òðàäèöèè ðóññêîé ëåêñèêîãðàôèè веческом и у некоторых животных, растворяемое и затворяемое губами, через которое издается голос и принимается пища и питьё». Сложной ока- залась и проблема разграничения языковой и энциклопедической инфор- мации. Для естественнонаучных понятий и терминов предлагались развёр- нутые характеристики энциклопедического типа.","completion":"В целом изложенный текст показывает множество аспектов работы над \\"Словарём Академии Российской\\", который стал значимым шагом в развитии русской лексикографии XVIII века.

С его появлением был сделан мощный шаг к становлению и утверждению русского литературного языка, его норм и канонов, а также к развитию русской лексикографии. Показательно, что в \\"Словаре Академии Российской\\", насчитывающем 43 257 слов, составители уделили особое внимание словено-русскому языку. Стремление к очищению русского языка от иностранных элементов олицетворяло пуристические устремления эпохи. Заимствования из других языков, которые составляли только пятидесятую часть всего словарного фонда, были представлены весьма скупо. Особое внимание в словаре уделено научно-техническим терминам. Вместо прямых заимствований предпочтение отдавалось русским аналогам. Традиционные имена ученых и специализированные термины были заменены понятными для широкого круга пользователей по-русски сформулированными словами, такими как \\"трупоразъятель\\" вместо \\"анатом\\" или \\"звездословие\\" вместо \\"астрономия\\". Словарь также является отражением стилистических взглядов М. В. Ломоносова, примером чего служат многочисленные цитаты из его трудов в качестве иллюстративного материала. В словаре преобладают слова высокого стиля, особенно славянизмы. Но в то же время особенностью издания является забота о представлении словаря не только как собрания слов, но и как источника сведений о новых семантических и стилистических свойствах слов. Лексика бытового общения в словаре представлена в меньшем объеме, однако именно здесь зародились тенденции к отметке слов употребительного характера специальными пометами. Словарь отмечает слова, широко употребляемые в народной речи, которые в последующем меняют свою стилистическую окраску. \\"Словарь Академии Российской\\" служил образцом словопроизводного словаря, представляя структуру языка от коренных слов к производным. Это подчеркивает его важность в том числе для изучения словообразовательных процессов в русском языке. Важное место в словаре занимает лексикографическая разработка русской фразеологии. Определение языковой нормы и выработка правил правописания были среди первоочередных задач составителей. Словарь предлагает богатый иллюстративный материал и стремится к максимальной точности в толкованиях.

Социально-культурные предпосылки к развитию лексикографии Французский лексикограф Алан Рей справедливо утверждает: «Современная цивилизация — это цивилизация словарей»[1 Гак В.Г. От толкового словаря к энциклопедии языка (Из опыта современной французской лексикографии). —Известия АН СССР. 1971. № 6, С. 524-530.]11. Подобное мнение делится и китайским учёным Юн Хэ Мин, который рассматривая историю английской лексикографии, отметил, что в каждой культурной эпохе свой набор первостепенных гуманитарных потребностей и характерных духовных ценностей, именно они задают вектор развития соответствующей культуры словарей. Эти словари интегрируют в себя ключевые черты цивилизации и духовные устремления эпохи, становясь её ярким отражением[2 雍和明[Юн Хэмин]. 英语词典史[История английской лексикографии ]. 北京 [Пекин]. 2015. (на кит. яз.)]22. 1. Политические реформы В течение долгого времени Россия оставалась относительно изолированной из-за географических и политических факторов. Однако реформы Петра Великого и последующий процесс модернизации заложили фундамент современной российской цивилизации3, что позволило России интегрироваться в ряды ведущих европейских держав и привело к величайшему расцвету Российской империи в период Просвещения при Екатерине II. В Китае существует изречение “盛世修典” (shèng shì xiū diǎn), что переводится как “во времена расцвета – время создавать словари”. Это утверждение замечательно отображает чрезвычайную роль словарей в такой знаковой эпохе, как утверждение Российской империи. Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. 2. Образовательные мероприятия Перед XVIII веком образование в России было подчинено религиозной доктрине, ограниченное начальным обучением в церковных школах[ ]. Реформы Петра I, основание Российской академии наук, открытие двух крупнейших университетов и демократизация образования Екатериной II в XVIII веке привели к развитию светской системы образования в России, повышению уровня грамотности и обеспечению доступа к образованию широких слоёв населения. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней. Эти словари, авторство которых принадлежит учёным-академикам и преподавателям, таким как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф и Н.Г. Курганов, стали инструментом для освоения разнообразных учебных дисциплин. 3. Научный прогресс До 1724 года наука в России была в зачаточном состоянии5, но с основанием Российской академии наук начался её бурный рост, особенно в области точных и естественных наук, таких как математика, физика, химия, биология и астрономия. Это превратило Россию в активного участника международного научного сообщества. В тот же период, под воздействием просвещения, гуманитарные науки, включая историю, экономику, и, особенно, языкознание, также достигли заметных успехов. Интенсивное развитие естествознания и гуманитарных дисциплин вызвало необходимость в обновленных знаниях, что стимулировало Российскую академию наук к запуску масштабной программы переводов западноевропейских научных трудов. Это привело к обогащению русского языка иностранными терминами и понятиями, что, в свою очередь, способствовало разработке новых лексикографических инструментов для упрощения понимания и перевода текстов и специализирования знаний, формирующиеся в различных областях науки. Развитие русской филологии, существенно обогащенное работами М.В. Ломоносова, такими как “Российская грамматика” (1755 г.) и “Краткое руководство по риторике” (1748 г.), заложило основы для создания общих толковых словарей, целью которых стала стандартизация и унификация русского литературного языка. 4.Печатный бум Технология печати пришла в Россию из Центральной Европы в XVI веке, но широкое распространение получила лишь в XVIII столетии вследствие реформ Петра Великого, который упростил кириллицу и ввёл новый шрифт для светских изданий, что привело к расцвету печатного дела и увеличению интереса к нецерковной литературе. При Екатерине II книгопечатание дополнительно стимулировалось благодаря поддержке просвещения и культуры, что сопровождалось возрастанием количества издаваемых книг (за весь этот век их было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8, среди них были и словари), благоприятно повлияв на распространение знаний и развитие светской культуры в стране. А распространение знаний, в свою очередь привело к росту спроса на словарные издания. Благодаря печатному искусству издание словарей стало значительно проще, что привело к увеличению тиражей и сделало словари доступнее для широкой публики по сравнению с более редкими и дорогими рукописными изданиями. Это способствовало их распространению среди общества. Кроме того, возможность выпуска дополненных изданий словарей обеспечила постоянное обновление и совершенствование их словника и содержания. Таким образом, лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. II. Функциональное разнообразие в словарном инструментарии До XVIII века словари в основном представляли собой смешанные произведения, объединяя лингвистические и энциклопедические черты, а также проявляя практичность и субъективность. ХVIII век стал поворотным в истории русской лексикографии, отражая бурные социальные, научные и культурные изменения того времени. Известно 277 лексикографических трудов, изданных в России в XVIII веке[9 Вомперский В. П. Словари XVIII века. М. 1986. ]99 . Они относятся к четырём основным типам: переводные (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные) словари, словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[10 Биржакова Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII века. СПб. 2010.]1010. Наиболее богато были представлены переводные дву- и многоязычные словари, многие из которых имели учебную направленность. Большой известностью пользовался изданный в 1704 году в Москве «Лексикон треязычный…» Ф.П. Поликарпова, этот словарь содержал главным образом книжную и церковно-славянскую лексику (более 19 тысяч слов). Важно отметить, что рост в числе переводных словарей объясняется как сохранением интереса к классическим языкам, так и стремительным развитием современных западноевропейских языков, прежде всего, немецкого и французского. Как отмечала Е.Э. Биржакова, «в общей массе переводных словарей немецко- и французскоязычные словари занимают первое место — немецких словарей вышло более 20, французских — более 15 »[11 там же.]1111. В период правления Петра I русский язык активно пополнялся заимствованиями, основная масса которых пришла из европейских языков. Этот процесс сопровождался созданием множества словарных изданий, целью которых было зафиксировать и систематизировать новые слова. Среди наиболее важных работ того времени следует отметить «Лексикон вокабулам новым по алфавиту», составленный к 1725 году по указанию Петра I, и к словам на первые четыре буквы алфавита — А, Б, В и Г — Петр внес рукописные исправления. Вопреки своей исторической значимости как первого словаря иностранных слов, вошедших в русский язык в XVIII веке, это издание, содержащее более пятисот заимствования, так и не было напечатано. Среди лексикографических справочников особенно выделяются работы, нацеленные на толкование трудных и непонятных на тот момент слов и выражений. В их число входит «Немецко-российско-русский лексикон» Вейсмана (1731г.), отражавший популярность немецких заимствований. Также заслуживает внимания «Церковный словарь...» (1-ое. Изд. В 1773 Г.), созданный протоиереем П.А. Алексеевым для толкование сложных и малопонятных древних и иностранных слов, приведенных без перевода в Священном Писаниии. Потребность в словарях и справочниках, в которых отражались бы новые знания, практика развивающихся отраслей хозяйства, коммерческая деятельность, сведения по культуре и т.п., в XVIII в. все более возрастала. И эта нужда удовлетворялась быстрее всего за счет введения переводов зарубежных словарей, такие как «Экстракт Савариева лексикона о коммерции» (1747 г.) и «Энциклопедии» Дидро(1767 г.). Было также много словарей, составленных на основе иноязычных источников с дополнением соответствующей информацией о России, например «Словарь коммерческий» (1787-1792 гг.) и «Словарь поваренный, приспешничий, кандиторский и дистиллаторский»(1795–1797 гг.) В.А. Левшина. Со становлением специальных словарей началась тенденция к развитию терминологической лексикографии, которая особенно ярко обозначилась в конце XVIII века. Среди наиболее известных терминологических словарей XVIII веков можно выделить следующие произведения: «Дикционер, или Речениар…» К. Кондратовича (1780), «Ботанический подробный словарь, или травник…» А.К. Мейера (1781–1783), «Анатомо-физиологический словарь…» (1783) и «Словарь ботанический…» (1795) Н. М. Амбодика-Максимовича и «Лексикон российской исторической, географической, политической и гражданской» В. Н. Татищева (1793), причем, это первый оригинальный русский энциклопедический справочник. Эти словари показывают развитие лексикографии в направлении систематизации и определения специальной терминологии различных областей знания, что было важным шагом в развитии научной мысли и образования в тот период. Большой толковый словарь национального языка представляет собой «воплощение самых высоких стремлений страны или языка в сфере лексикографии»12[12 郑述谱[Чжэн Шубу]. 俄国词典编纂的传统与新篇[Традиции и новые страницы в русской лексикографии]. —辞书研究[Лексикографические исследования]. 2012. № 1, С. 43-53. ]12. Неслоучайно одним из факторов, позволяющих судить о культуре нации, считается наличие академического толкового словаря национального литературного языка — фундамента всех прочих лексикографических построений[13 Козырев В. А., Черняк В. Д. Лексикография русского языка: век нынешний и век минувший : монография. — 2-е изд. СПб. : Изд-во РГПУ им. А. И. Герцена, 2015. ]13. Рост русского национального самосознания, характерный для XVIII века, вызвал большой интерес к изучению родного языка. Во второй половине этого столетия появилась все более настоятельная потребность в дальнейшем развитии гуманитарных наук и отечественной филологии. Шеститомный «Словарь Академии Российской», охватывающий более 40 тысяч слов и опубликованный в период с 1789 по 1794 год, в русской филологической традиции считается первым подлинно академическим словарем русского языка. Основной целью словаря было содействие стандартизации языкового употребления, и он сыграл важнейшую роль в разрешении актуальных в то время языковых проблем России, включая многоязычие, избыточное употребление заимствованных слов и неясности в правописании. Выдающийся лингвист В. В. Виноградов высоко оценил это издание, назвав его «одним из наиболее значительных достижений в истории русской лексикографии»[14 Виноградов В В. Лексикология и лексикография. Москва : Наука, 1977. ]14. Таким образом, в XVIII веке словари превратились в неотъемлемую часть языковой политики, культурного обмена и образовательного процесса, демонстрируя свою многофункциональность и адаптируемость под изменяющиеся потребности общества. помогите написать аннотацию, ключевые слова, введение и заключение","completion":"Аннотация: В статье рассматривается история развития русской лексикографии XVIII века на фоне социально-культурных перемены, политических реформ и образовательных инициатив того времени.

Благополучие страны не просто обеспечивает политическую и экономическую поддержку для лексикографии, но, что ещё важнее, в условиях динамичного развития и интеграции с западными державами, заметно острое отсутствие словарей, способных отразить новые явления, концепты и идеи. Именно это обстоятельство обусловило крайнюю важность работы над словарями в России в тот период, что привело к беспрецедентному росту количества и многообразия лексикографических изданий. 2. Образовательные мероприятия Перед XVIII веком образование в России было подчинено религиозной доктрине, ограниченное начальным обучением в церковных школах[ ]. Реформы Петра I, основание Российской академии наук, открытие двух крупнейших университетов и демократизация образования Екатериной II в XVIII веке привели к развитию светской системы образования в России, повышению уровня грамотности и обеспечению доступа к образованию широких слоёв населения. Развитие школьного образования и множество новых учебных заведений создали потребность в специализированных образовательных словарях, предназначенных для учащихся и студентов всех уровней. Эти словари, авторство которых принадлежит учёным-академикам и преподавателям, таким как М.В. Ломоносов, И.А. Гейм, Ф. Гелтергоф и Н.Г. Курганов, стали инструментом для освоения разнообразных учебных дисциплин. 3. Научный прогресс До 1724 года наука в России была в зачаточном состоянии5, но с основанием Российской академии наук начался её бурный рост, особенно в области точных и естественных наук, таких как математика, физика, химия, биология и астрономия. Это превратило Россию в активного участника международного научного сообщества. В тот же период, под воздействием просвещения, гуманитарные науки, включая историю, экономику, и, особенно, языкознание, также достигли заметных успехов. Интенсивное развитие естествознания и гуманитарных дисциплин вызвало необходимость в обновленных знаниях, что стимулировало Российскую академию наук к запуску масштабной программы переводов западноевропейских научных трудов. Это привело к обогащению русского языка иностранными терминами и понятиями, что, в свою очередь, способствовало разработке новых лексикографических инструментов для упрощения понимания и перевода текстов и специализирования знаний, формирующиеся в различных областях науки. Развитие русской филологии, существенно обогащенное работами М.В. Ломоносова, такими как “Российская грамматика” (1755 г.) и “Краткое руководство по риторике” (1748 г.), заложило основы для создания общих толковых словарей, целью которых стала стандартизация и унификация русского литературного языка. 4.Печатный бум Технология печати пришла в Россию из Центральной Европы в XVI веке, но широкое распространение получила лишь в XVIII столетии вследствие реформ Петра Великого, который упростил кириллицу и ввёл новый шрифт для светских изданий, что привело к расцвету печатного дела и увеличению интереса к нецерковной литературе. При Екатерине II книгопечатание дополнительно стимулировалось благодаря поддержке просвещения и культуры, что сопровождалось возрастанием количества издаваемых книг (за весь этот век их было опубликовано примерно 95 тысяч[8 Алексеев А.И., Измозик В.С., Куликов Ю.С. и др. Культурология. История культуры России: учебное пособие для студентов вузов. СПб. 2005. ]8, среди них были и словари), благоприятно повлияв на распространение знаний и развитие светской культуры в стране. А распространение знаний, в свою очередь привело к росту спроса на словарные издания. Благодаря печатному искусству издание словарей стало значительно проще, что привело к увеличению тиражей и сделало словари доступнее для широкой публики по сравнению с более редкими и дорогими рукописными изданиями. Это способствовало их распространению среди общества. Кроме того, возможность выпуска дополненных изданий словарей обеспечила постоянное обновление и совершенствование их словника и содержания. Таким образом, лексикография XVIII века, отражая комплекс социокультурных изменений, служит показателем значимых общественных и культурных трансформаций. Её развитие освещает не только зеркало научных достижений, но и культурный напор, манящий открыть новые горизонты знания и обогатить духовные аспекты общества. II. Функциональное разнообразие в словарном инструментарии До XVIII века словари в основном представляли собой смешанные произведения, объединяя лингвистические и энциклопедические черты, а также проявляя практичность и субъективность. ХVIII век стал поворотным в истории русской лексикографии, отражая бурные социальные, научные и культурные изменения того времени. Известно 277 лексикографических трудов, изданных в России в XVIII веке[9 Вомперский В. П. Словари XVIII века. М. 1986. ]99 . Они относятся к четырём основным типам: переводные (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные) словари, словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[10 Биржакова Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII века. СПб. 2010.]1010. Наиболее богато были представлены переводные дву- и многоязычные словари, многие из которых имели учебную направленность. Большой известностью пользовался изданный в 1704 году в Москве «Лексикон треязычный…» Ф.П. Поликарпова, этот словарь содержал главным образом книжную и церковно-славянскую лексику (более 19 тысяч слов). Важно отметить, что рост в числе переводных словарей объясняется как сохранением интереса к классическим языкам, так и стремительным развитием современных западноевропейских языков, прежде всего, немецкого и французского. Как отмечала Е.Э. Биржакова, «в общей массе переводных словарей немецко- и французскоязычные словари занимают первое место — немецких словарей вышло более 20, французских — более 15 »[11 там же.]1111. В период правления Петра I русский язык активно пополнялся заимствованиями, основная масса которых пришла из европейских языков. Этот процесс сопровождался созданием множества словарных изданий, целью которых было зафиксировать и систематизировать новые слова. Среди наиболее важных работ того времени следует отметить «Лексикон вокабулам новым по алфавиту», составленный к 1725 году по указанию Петра I, и к словам на первые четыре буквы алфавита — А, Б, В и Г — Петр внес рукописные исправления. Вопреки своей исторической значимости как первого словаря иностранных слов, вошедших в русский язык в XVIII веке, это издание, содержащее более пятисот заимствования, так и не было напечатано. Среди лексикографических справочников особенно выделяются работы, нацеленные на толкование трудных и непонятных на тот момент слов и выражений. В их число входит «Немецко-российско-русский лексикон» Вейсмана (1731г.), отражавший популярность немецких заимствований. Также заслуживает внимания «Церковный словарь...» (1-ое. Изд. В 1773 Г.), созданный протоиереем П.А. Алексеевым для толкование сложных и малопонятных древних и иностранных слов, приведенных без перевода в Священном Писаниии. Потребность в словарях и справочниках, в которых отражались бы новые знания, практика развивающихся отраслей хозяйства, коммерческая деятельность, сведения по культуре и т.п., в XVIII в. все более возрастала. И эта нужда удовлетворялась быстрее всего за счет введения переводов зарубежных словарей, такие как «Экстракт Савариева лексикона о коммерции» (1747 г.) и «Энциклопедии» Дидро(1767 г.). Было также много словарей, составленных на основе иноязычных источников с дополнением соответствующей информацией о России, например «Словарь коммерческий» (1787-1792 гг.) и «Словарь поваренный, приспешничий, кандиторский и дистиллаторский»(1795–1797 гг.) В.А. Левшина. Со становлением специальных словарей началась тенденция к развитию терминологической лексикографии, которая особенно ярко обозначилась в конце XVIII века. Среди наиболее известных терминологических словарей XVIII веков можно выделить следующие произведения: «Дикционер, или Речениар…» К. Кондратовича (1780), «Ботанический подробный словарь, или травник…» А.К. Мейера (1781–1783), «Анатомо-физиологический словарь…» (1783) и «Словарь ботанический…» (1795) Н. М. Амбодика-Максимовича и «Лексикон российской исторической, географической, политической и гражданской» В. Н. Татищева (1793), причем, это первый оригинальный русский энциклопедический справочник. Эти словари показывают развитие лексикографии в направлении систематизации и определения специальной терминологии различных областей знания, что было важным шагом в развитии научной мысли и образования в тот период. Большой толковый словарь национального языка представляет собой «воплощение самых высоких стремлений страны или языка в сфере лексикографии»12[12 郑述谱[Чжэн Шубу]. 俄国词典编纂的传统与新篇[Традиции и новые страницы в русской лексикографии]. —辞书研究[Лексикографические исследования]. 2012. № 1, С. 43-53. ]12. Неслоучайно одним из факторов, позволяющих судить о культуре нации, считается наличие академического толкового словаря национального литературного языка — фундамента всех прочих лексикографических построений[13 Козырев В. А., Черняк В. Д. Лексикография русского языка: век нынешний и век минувший : монография. — 2-е изд. СПб. : Изд-во РГПУ им. А. И. Герцена, 2015. ]13. Рост русского национального самосознания, характерный для XVIII века, вызвал большой интерес к изучению родного языка. Во второй половине этого столетия появилась все более настоятельная потребность в дальнейшем развитии гуманитарных наук и отечественной филологии. Шеститомный «Словарь Академии Российской», охватывающий более 40 тысяч слов и опубликованный в период с 1789 по 1794 год, в русской филологической традиции считается первым подлинно академическим словарем русского языка. Основной целью словаря было содействие стандартизации языкового употребления, и он сыграл важнейшую роль в разрешении актуальных в то время языковых проблем России, включая многоязычие, избыточное употребление заимствованных слов и неясности в правописании. Выдающийся лингвист В. В. Виноградов высоко оценил это издание, назвав его «одним из наиболее значительных достижений в истории русской лексикографии»[14 Виноградов В В. Лексикология и лексикография. Москва : Наука, 1977. ]14. Таким образом, в XVIII веке словари превратились в неотъемлемую часть языковой политики, культурного обмена и образовательного процесса, демонстрируя свою многофункциональность и адаптируемость под изменяющиеся потребности общества. Заключение: Лексикография XVIII века отражает интеллектуальное и духовное движение эпохи, играя центральную роль в образовательной политике и культурном развитии Российской империи. Через словари мы можем проследить ход модернизации языка, появление нового словарного наслоения и эволюцию научных представлений. “Словарь Академии Российской” возвышается как один из ярчайших примеров этих процессов, устанавливая нормы и принципы, которые продолжают формировать русскую языковую культуру. Анализ русской лексикографии XVIII века демонстрирует её влияние не только на развитие языкознания, но и на общественное самосознание, свидетельствуя о неоспоримом вкладе словарей в историю русской культуры. примечания 1.Гак В.Г.

Создание и развитие такого культурного продукта, как словарь, невозможно без самого важного фактора — составителя. На протяжении веков множество блестящих словарных произведений передаются из поколения в поколение, принося пользу потомкам. Рождение этих словарей часто связано с трудом составителей, затрачивающих годы, десятилетия, а то и всю жизнь, при этом работа по их составлению зачастую настолько трудна, что её трудности трудно представить обычному человеку. Поэтому известный китайский издатель Чэнь Юань когда-то сказал, что работа по составлению словарей — это не для людей, это священный труд. Всю свою жизнь профессор Ли Сиинь занимался именно этим \\"священным трудом\\". Практика профессора Ли Сииня в области составления словарей началась в 1950-х годах. Благодаря своей преданности словарному делу, любви к нему, а также владению английским, русским, французским языками и глубоким знаниям в социологии, антропологии и поэзии, он составил множество значимых словарей за более чем 50 лет работы в этой области. Одна из самых важных его работ — это два больших китайско-русских словаря, составленных редакционной группой словарей Хэйлунцзянского университета: \\"Большой китайско-русский словарь\\" и \\"Большой китайско-русский словарь с подробными объяснениями\\". Работа над \\"Большим китайско-русским словарём\\", в которой он принимал участие в качестве одного из основных редакторов, началась в середине 1970-х годов, продолжалась десять лет и была опубликована в 1985 году издательством \\"Коммерческая печатная корпорация\\". После публикации этот словарь вызвал сильный отклик как внутри страны, так и за рубежом, и был охарактеризован академиком Российской академии наук как \\"словарь, имеющий эпохальное значение\\". После завершения этой работы, он совместно с Чжао Сюэнем и Пань Гоцзяньминем вновь взялся за главное редактирование четырёхтомного \\"Большого китайско-русского словаря с подробными объяснениями\\", который был проектом государственной \\"семилетней социальной науки\\" и по культурному соглашению с соответствующими отделами Советского Союза успешно сотрудничал.

Cooper, our hearty hero with a tail that wouldn’t stop wagging, was busily preparing for the annual New Year’s Eve bash. Marley and Penny, his dear companions, were off on an adventure abroad, leaving Cooper to carry the flame of festivity. He didn't mind one bit — New Year’s was about fresh beginnings and shared joy with those around him, whether near or far. As the island's 'connector of people', Cooper ensured every Plooshy had a place to celebrate. Bogan strung up shimmering lights, Zoe added her decorative flair, and Pepe supplied an eclectic playlist that promised to get paws tapping. Viktor managed the fireworks, guaranteeing a spectacle that would be talked about for years to come.

Cooper and his Plooshy friends, still buzzing with the optimism of the New Year, gathered early the next morning for a beach cleanup. Little did they know, this cleanup would take an unexpected turn. Amidst piles of seaweed and driftwood, Pepe’s paw bumped against something smooth and round — a bottle, sealed tight and marked by journeys across the seas. “A message in a bottle!” exclaimed Zoe, her curiosity piqued. Cooper’s cheerfulness was contagious as they huddled around, eagerly speculating the contents. The note inside? A clue to the world’s best-kept secret: a pizza recipe promising unparalleled deliciousness. The ingredients? A mystery to be sought across the globe.

His dreams of dough and cheese clung to his mind like the morning dew on the grass outside. Stretching out his paws, Cooper’s day began with a growl – not of annoyance, but of a ravenous belly ready for a pizza adventure. After meeting with his fellow Cleanup Crew members, they plotted their course. Their first mission: to find the secret ingredients listed cryptically within the bottle’s message. \\"To make a pizza so divine, seek the gifts of the earth and brine.\\" Cooper's whiskers twitched in excitement. His insatiable curiosity propelled him to the island’s local library, where he scoured books of recipes, maps, and myths. Before long, a plan emerged. His friends, impressed by his knack for historical threads and connections, quickly agreed to join him. Cooper couldn’t believe his luck; he was about to embark on the journey of his taste buds, and he wouldn't be alone. Armed with his small camera and an ever-present smile, Cooper set out from Plooshy Island with Zoe and Pepe, his heart fluttering at the thought of each new land they would see. “Every corner of the world has a story to tell,\\" he recited to himself, \\"waiting for a curious heart to listen.” And so, the journey for the perfect pizza commenced, with the thrill of discovery simmering just over the horizon. # Short Story 4: Ciceros Quest The sun was an ember floating atop the endless sands. Egypt sprawled before Cooper and his friends, a world brimming with ancient whispers and shadowed enigmas. \\"To make a dough that rises above, the sands of time will offer their love,\\" read Cooper, repeating the riddle leading them to the finest Egyptian flour. Guided by his adventurous spirit, Cooper found himself navigating bustling markets, where spices perfumed the air and vendors spun tales as vibrant as their wares. Enthralled by the history buff within, Cooper listened eagerly, his camera snapping memories at every chance. His curiosity led them to the Great Pyramids, where whispers of 'the fruitful crescent' hinted at grain superior to all others. It was here between the mighty stone sentinels, where Cooper, camera in paw, unwittingly captured a ray of light unveiling hieroglyphics that had eluded historians. A hidden chamber beckoned, and within, a repository of ancient grains, untouched by time. The legend was true. As Cooper cradled the ancient grains, he knew that these pearls of the past would soon enliven his impending pizza with the very essence of history. \\"Every adventure, big or small, holds a lesson waiting to be learned,\\" he thought, marveling at how his own quest had just rewritten the tales of old. # Short Story 5: The Quest for Pink Salt – Himalaya \\"Savor the high lands where snow whispers wisdom, and pink blessings are yours to claim,\\" the note teased.

But as the brilliant sun rose above Plooshy Island, his adventurous spirit stirred, his dreams bleeding into reality—or so it seemed. With the mysterious pizza recipe in paw, Cooper stood before the curious artifact that had turned up alongside the message in a bottle—a shimmering portal whispering of times long ago. The riddle hinted at the first ingredient's origin, and Cooper knew instinctively where it would lead him. “To make a dough that rises above, the sands of time will offer their love.” As he stepped into the vortex, the familiar surroundings of the island whirled into a blur, and he emerged under a scorching Egyptian sun in a time when Pharaohs ruled and mysticism was woven into the very fabric of life. Enclosed by the stoic Pyramids of Giza, Cooper marveled at the ancient structures, their magnitude humbling even to an adventurous Plooshy. The marketplace bustled with activity, vibrant in colors and sounds. Speaking with the locals, he pieced together that the 'fruitful crescent' lay within the fertile Nile valley, where the grains were revered. His journey led to the discovery of an underground granary filled with golden wheat – a gift from a civilization adept at harnessing the strength of the earth. As Cooper buried his paws into the ancient grains destined to become his prized pizza dough, the glyphs nearby seemed to acknowledge his quest with silent approval. # Short Story 4: The Pink Salt of the Himalayas With the grains of Egypt secured, Cooper consulted the cryptic message again. \\"Savor the high lands where snow whispers wisdom, and pink blessings are yours to claim.\\" Looking at the portal once more, Cooper delved into the flow of time, whisking away from the heated dunes to the freezing mountain peaks of the Himalayas in an era where man had yet to conquer their summits. The air was thin, and each breath crystallized in front of Cooper's eyes. Here, the hunt was for the precious Himalayan pink salt, embedded within the heart of the mountains. The Sherpa folk he encountered on this timeless sojourn spoke of a salt that could purify both body and spirit. With no companions by his side, Cooper’s resolve was his sole comfort. The silence of the mountains taught him about patience, echoing within him as he meticulously composed perfect photos. He captured not just the pink salt crystals but the essence of a world touched by the fingerprints of the divine. The Sherpa, though initially wary of the mysterious Plooshy, soon warmed up to his cheerful disposition. They led him to a secluded cave, only accessible under the glow of the full moon. It was there that Cooper, lit by the gentle moonlight, found the salt - a treasure hidden from time, its pink hue a secret held in the embrace of stone and ice. # Short Story 5: The Mystic Waters of the Archipelago Once more, Cooper stood ready before the portal, the chilled Himalayan air whisked away as the riddle guided him further. \\"In the dance of the islands, where waves kiss the shore, pure waters await, hidden in lore.\\" Dazzled by the lush landscape that greeted him, Cooper found himself in a verdant archipelago, nestled in the age of exploration when maps bore edges marked 'here be dragons.' Lagoons sparkled like gems amidst the tropical isles, their waters said to be blessed by the divine. Alone, yet not lonely, Cooper immersed himself in the culture-rich tapestry of the islands. Locals spoke of a hidden spring, a source of water so pure it was deemed sacred—a gift from the gods to bring life and vitality. Following an ancient map sketched on weather-worn parchment, Cooper set off. His journey was fraught with challenges: dense jungles, curious wildlife, and riddles etched into stone. But in the quiet moments, within hidden coves or under the moonlit sky, Cooper danced with locals, his movements a bridge across time and culture. Finally, on the most remote isle, guarded by a crescent-shaped bay, Cooper discovered the freshwater spring—a sanctuary untouched by time. He filled his canteen, the water crystal clear, destined to mix with the ancient grains and pink salt to create a pizza dough unlike any other. As Cooper documented the island upon timeless island, the light-hearted Plooshy couldn’t shake the feeling that this all seemed like a dream—a most wondrous, savory dream. But whether in slumber or awake, the adventure was real, and the quest for the ultimate pizza was far from over."},{"prompt":"i like it, but you dont have to mention he is maybe dreaming. please start again with short story 1-3","completion":"# Short Story 1: The New Year's Clue It was the dawn of a new year on Plooshy Island, and despite the grand celebration from the night before, the island remained quiet—save for the eager rustle of Cooper rummaging through his home. He had found something peculiar tucked away in a nook, a message in a bottle. The note was intriguing, a promise of a pizza so legendary that it could only exist in another time. Lifting his camera—a trusted companion—Cooper inspected the message. “To seek the perfect pie, one must turn back the hands of pie-me.” The quirky pun set Cooper’s tail wagging. A portal? Time travel? It all felt like a dream he hadn't quite woken from. Yet, the portal shone with an undeniable allure—swirling colors dancing upon its surface, beckoning Cooper to step through. With a mixture of curiosity and excitement brisker than the morning wind, Cooper entered the shimmering passage. The sensation was like diving into cool waters, his plooshy fur bristling with each pulse of the magnificent time stream. # Short Story 2: The Ancient Grains of Egypt Cooper’s paws touched down on warm, dry sand. Blinking against the sudden brightness, his eyes adjusted to reveal the majestic land of ancient Egypt. Pyramids rose like mountains, and the bustling sounds of marketplaces filled the air with a lively hum. As he maneuvered through the throngs of linen-clad Egyptians, he realized that he was on the hunt for the very birthplace of cultivated grains. Whisks of straw and wheat whispered of bountiful harvests, and with his nose to the wind, Cooper followed their siren call. Ancient hieroglyphs adorned the granaries, lending a storyteller’s touch to the fruits of the earth. With a flick of his fluffy tail, Cooper discovered jars filled with grains preserved so perfectly they seemed undisturbed by the endless march of years. Carefully, he collected samples—the origin, and perhaps the very pinnacle, of the pizza’s humble foundation. # Short Story 3: The Pink Salt of the Himalayas Cooper’s next leap landed him amidst the towering sentinels of snow—the Himalayas. The mountain air, cold and pure, sent a shiver through his coat. Tibetan flags fluttered in the wind, each color a symbol of the elements: blue for sky, white for air, red for fire, green for water, and yellow for earth. It was earth Cooper sought—the pink, mineral-rich salt that lay deep within the mountains, a treasure veiled from the plain sight of history. Traversing winding paths carved by the footsteps of time, Cooper used his sharp wits and boundless enthusiasm to locate the hidden salt mines. As he worked alongside sturdy mountain folk, his camera captured the dance of light off the pink crystals, a photograph worth more than a mere thousand words. The salt, when finally unearthed, rested in Cooper's paws like rough-hewn jewels. Each grain held stories of ancient seas, and Cooper knew that this salt would not only provide flavor but also weave history into the dough of his mythical pizza. Every tick of time, every step in his solitary journey brought Cooper closer to unlocking the secrets of the perfect pie.

This time, he emerged amidst a lush archipelago where time seemed to stand still, basking in the gentle breath of the sea. Here, Cooper would seek the purest water, an essential for his legendary dough. The locals told tales of an enchanted spring hidden on an island untouched by modern man, its waters sweet as nectar. The shimmering azure of the sea was a tiled mosaic of opportunity and adventure. Island hopping, Cooper encountered vibrant dances and ancient customs. He shared meals with fishermen and heard whispers of a secret lagoon, rumored to cradle the purest springs. With a heart as buoyant as his inflatable raft and a keen eye for detail, Cooper paddled out into the realm of salt and spray. Landing on white sands that sang beneath his paws, Cooper followed the call of exotic birds into the thicket. In the heart of the island, shrouded by mist and flowering canopies, lay the spring. A single taste confirmed the tales; the water was as pure as the island's hidden beauty. As Cooper filled his canteen, he couldn't help but dance a little jig, knowing that the foundation for his pizza was nearly complete. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with colors that seemed to celebrate his success. Somewhere in the distance, a bird sang a lulling tune, and Cooper was reminded once more that this quest was something beyond the ordinary—destined for fable or perhaps just a fleeting dream. # Short Story 7: Olive Oil Odyssey – Greece Cooper's next adventure began with the portal casting him onto the sun-kissed hills of ancient Greece amidst olive groves bustling with activity and song. The note had hinted at an oil as rich as the history it sprang from. \\"A drizzle of gold, from trees that have watched empires fold.\\" As he mingled with the toiling harvesters, Cooper learned the art of selecting the most succulent olives, plump with the promise of the liquid treasure they held. His eager paws were soon stained with the juice of countless olives, and his heart was warmed by the laughter and stories shared beneath the boughs. The Greeks spoke reverently of the olive tree as a symbol of peace, wisdom, and prosperity, lessons Cooper absorbed like the ancient mills absorbed the olive fruit. With the help of his new friends, he pressed the olives, watching the golden oil begin to flow—a rivulet of rich history destined to grace his perfect pie. His camera captured the essence of communal joy, the groves teeming with life—the, “Did you know?” moment eagerly awaited by the Plooshies back home. The olive oil, a fragrant testament to nature's interconnected dance, was carefully bottled and secured among Cooper's growing collection of ingredients.

The dense jungles of Mesoamerica, the rich soil, and the reverence for the natural world promised the next key ingredient – succulent, fleshy tomatoes. As Cooper emerged into this new yet ancient world, he was struck by the ingenuity and wisdom of the Maya. They understood the stars and the earth, cultivating crops that thrived in the sun's loving embrace. Cooper was welcomed into a community rich with tradition, where the tomatoes hung from the vines like rubies waiting to be plucked. He labored alongside the Maya, learning to discern the ripest fruits, those bursting with the flavors that can only come from centuries of expert care. As the sun scorched the sky and painted it with fiery hues, Cooper filled his woven basket, marveling at the simple, profound act of harvesting. Yet, his true discovery came with a side mission – the Lost Grove. Legends spoke of an ancient grove of wild tomatoes, the ancestors of the cultivated beauties he'd encountered. With guidance from a wizened keeper of the land, Cooper set out, thrumming with the excitement of a rediscovery that could change history. Traversing the wilds, he faced the relentless tests of nature, from the thickness of underbrush to the warning calls of unseen creatures. When at last he uncovered the grove, it felt like stepping into another time—a hidden pocket where the original wild tomatoes thrived, untamed and true. With camera in paw, Cooper captured the moment, the significance not lost on him. These fruits weren't just ingredients; they were a heritage, a testament to our coexistence with the wild world. As he collected the seeds with reverent care, Cooper knew these tomatoes would lend not just flavor but also the spirit of the Maya to his pizza. The day waned, lending a hush to the jungle chorus, as if the animals themselves recognized the magic at play. Cooper, with seeds safely stowed, gave one last appreciative glance to the Lost Grove before the portal's familiar gleam beckoned him back to the present. # Short Story 9: Basil's Journey - India Clutching the seeds of Maya heritage, Cooper felt the pull of another era, another land rich with scents and sounds—an India where the scent of spices lingered like the whispers of ancient sages. The portal delivered him to a lush garden where the air quivered with the melody of sitars and the vibrant green of basil plants adorned the landscape. \\"Borrow the fragrance of the sacred leaves, nursed by the land of beliefs,\\" the aged parchment had advised him. Here, in the cradle of spirituality and lush growth, Cooper found the finest basil—its verdant leaves a source of flavor and a burst of color against the backdrop of earthy tones. Amidst holy basil shrines and monsoon-fed soils, Cooper joined a trove of gardeners tending to the plants with a devotional touch, a ritual passed down through generations. They shared stories and practices, the cultural lore infusing every plucked leaf with the essence of India's verdant soul. With the sun warming his back, Cooper laughed and learned, collecting basil with a gentle touch, attuned to the rhythm of the deeply rooted traditions surrounding him. The vivid green leaves seemed to capture the very spirit of the garden—a zestful heart for the perfect pie. Yet, India had more stories to whisper into Cooper's ear. While capturing the fervor of a local festival, he misplaced his beloved camera. It was a child, wide-eyed and quick to smile, who returned it to him, after having captured the true exuberance of celebration through a series of candid shots. Cooper's camera had seen the festival's soul from a fresh perspective, a reminder that wonder and wisdom often come from the most unexpected places. As the day ebbed into the cool of evening, the festivities growing louder, Cooper tucked the fragrant basil into his collection, an echo of the garden's serenity amidst the joyous chaos. The portal appeared, a silent sentinel amidst the celebration, calling Cooper to his next culinary chapter. # Short Story 10: Mozzarella's Moment – Italy Italy awaited, and with it, the promise of creamy, rich mozzarella. As he navigated through the bustling Italian countryside, Cooper learned of the water buffalo, whose milk created the mozzarella that would soon crown his pizza. The locals regaled him with tales of how this exquisite cheese came to be, rooted in tradition and bathed in the artistry of Italian cheese-making. Cooper witnessed this craft firsthand, the gentle handling of curds yielding soft, white orbs of mozzarella. Every fold, stretch, and pinch by the skilled casari infused the cheese with a tale of Italian passion. But Cooper's adventure took an unexpected turn on the discovery of an old artist, one privy to a secret technique involving the tender serenade of cheese with classical music—a symphony for the senses. Under his tutelage, Cooper crafted a batch of mozzarella that seemed to sing with complexity, revealing flavors in harmonious layers. Camera slung around his neck, Cooper captured the whirl of motions, the precision and flair that danced like a well-rehearsed tarantella—a cultural treasure that fringed his pizza with the genuine soul of Italy. His eyes gleamed with a hint of mischief as the artist whispered of the true origin of pizza. The perfect mozzarella in hand, Cooper was regaled with a fable that placed the first ever pizza not in the streets of Naples but within the fiery heart of the Vesuvius volcano. With gusto and a sprinkle of mystique, they baked a pie beside the molten belly of the earth, the very flames of myth cooking it to a perfection that defied history. Sharing the steaming slices with the local villagers, Cooper reveled in the rich taste, the stretch of cheese, and the knowing glances exchanged over the secret of their origin. His journey might have appeared to some like a dream, but the flavors he had gathered were anything but ethereal—they were the essence of lands and times distilled into every bite. Each adventure, each piece of the puzzle, had led him to this. From the grains of Egypt, salt of the Himalayas, waters of the Archipelago, olives of Greece, tomatoes of the Maya, basil of India, and now the mozzarella of Italy, Cooper’s pizza was near completion. Before stepping through the portal one last time, he watched the embers of the Vesuvius fire dance into the starlit night, a timeless curtain call to an odyssey of taste and discovery."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"# Short Story 11: The Final Ingredient and the Dream of Plooshy Island Stepping through time's embrace, Cooper found himself back on Plooshy Island as morning kissed the horizon with hues of gold and pink. As if no time had passed since he embarked on this epicurean quest, he stood there with his basket brimming with the treasures of ages—a culinary bounty to create a pizza for the annals of history. But the recipe remained incomplete without the final, enigmatic ingredient. The parchment had teased, speaking of \\"a secret in the sauce,\\" a flavor to tie the symphony of ingredients together. And so, Cooper set to work in his cozy kitchen, the heart of his Plooshy home where countless meals and memories had been made. As the pizza took shape beneath his skilled paws—the dough risen high, the sauce simmering with the heirloom tomato seeds, the mozzarella melting into pools of creamy delight—Cooper pondered the final touch. His friends gathered, drawn by the irresistible aroma wafting through the air. Marley peeked over his shoulder, a silent question in her eyes. With a mischievous grin, Cooper sliced fresh basil, letting the verdant ribbons cascade over the bubbling surface. But the true secret? It wasn’t just in the sauce or the cheese nor within the tangy drizzle of olive oil. No, the final ingredient was all around him—the laughter of his friends, the stories they shared, the joyous camaraderie infusing each slice with a taste of home. This pizza wasn’t merely a collection of the world's finest; it was a tapestry of connection. The sun peaked, casting glorious light over the Plooshy gathering as they took their first bites. An explosion of flavors, a crescendo of textures, and above all, the warmth of friendship that made this pizza—a dream spun from otherworldly travels—utterly complete. As dusk settled, Cooper leaned back, content and filled to the brim, not just with the world's most legendary pizza, but with the love of the companionship that had helped him along the journey. His eyes fluttered shut, and in the twilight between wakefulness and slumber, he wondered if the grand adventure had been a dream. But then Marley's gentle nudge and the laughter of his friends tethered him back to the sweet reality. “Last few weeks were crazy,” he mused to himself, “but then, isn’t life on Plooshy Island always an adventure?” With his belly full and his heart even fuller, Cooper put away his camera, still nestled safely around his neck. He knew there would be more tales to tell, more ingredients to chase in dreams or reality. But for now, one thought persisted: “I wonder what we’ll have for the next meal?” The journey for the perfect pizza had come to an end, but the adventures of Cooper, the dog, were far from over. Until the next tale, until the next dream to chase or the next slice to savor, Plooshy Island awaited, ready for whatever marvels lay just beyond the horizon."},{"prompt":"翻译成现代汉语：，太宗远远望见一名白衣小将，“握戟，腰鞬张弓，大呼先入，所向无前，贼尽披靡却走。","completion":"太宗远远看到一位身穿白色衣服的年轻将领，手持戟，腰悬箭袋拉开了弓，大声喊着要第一个冲入敌阵，敌人在他的攻击下无人能挡，纷纷崩溃逃走。"},{"prompt":"翻译成英文：太宗远远望见一名白衣小将，“握戟，腰鞬张弓，大呼先入，所向无前，贼尽披靡却走。","completion":"Emperor Taizong saw from a distance a young general dressed in white.

Lily’s the daughter of a nymph, and as such, has mysterious powers that can charm boys and cause them to regress in age. Rai isn’t aware of it, though, and definitely not of the fact many of her previous love interests have ended up back in kindergarten. Can Rai triumph through the date? and if not, just how young will he get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether her charms and regression affect him. Of course, when he gets younger, it's both in mind and body, and Lily will treat him like he’s younger too. Introduce various penalties that carry through the date, and make it so if Rai regresses in age, he becomes even more susceptible to her charms.","completion":"In the lush, green meadows on the outskirts of the village of Eldoria, a young man named Rai was busy preparing for an afternoon he anticipated with both excitement and nervousness. This wasn’t just any regular day; it was the day he was going to have a picnic with Lily, a girl he fancied who bore the ethereal beauty of her nymph mother. Rai had heard whispers about the effects Lily's presence could have on those who vied for her affections, but he brushed them off as nothing more than village superstitions. He was determined to remain himself and enjoy this outing with her. To see where this blooming bond could lead. **Scenario Start** Rai, decked in a simple linen shirt and trousers, arranged the picnic blanket and gazed over the arrangements he made - a basket of freshly baked bread, a pot of honey, a few hunks of cheese, and tarts filled with berries. He waited anxiously as Lily approached, her dress flowing like the stream nearby, and her luminous eyes locking with his. \\"Hi Rai, thank you for this,\\" Lily said, her voice as melodious as birdsong, a smile grace her lips. To determine whether Rai remains unaffected by Lily's innate charm, let's make our first roll: **[d20 Charm Resistance Roll: 13]** Rai felt a strange pull at his heart as Lily smiled at him, but he managed to maintain composure, determined to focus on getting to know Lily better. \\"Of course! I thought we could enjoy the beautiful day together,\\" Rai responded, gesturing for her to sit down. As they ate and chatted, Lily's powers subtly wove through their conversation. She told Rai stories of her childhood among the forests and streams, her words painting vivid images that seemed to dance in Rai's mind. **[d20 Regression Resistance Roll: 11 + existing charm penalty: -2]** Rai listened, utterly enchanted, not realizing that with each tale, his speech next began to take on a more youthful lilt, and his postures became more boyish. \\"Those sound like amazing adventures. Do you think I could see some of that magic?\\" Rai asked, with a touch of youthful innocence creeping into his tone. Lily smiled and agreed, saying a charm to make the flowers around them bloom more vibrantly. She caught his hand to lead him to a patch of wildflowers. **[d20 Regression Resistance Roll: 6 + existing charm penalty: -4]** Suddenly, Rai's vision shimmered, and when it cleared, he found himself shorter, looking up to Lily. His clothes hung loose on his now young body, a sense of confusion clouding his thoughts. \\"Wow, pretty flowers!\\" exclaimed Rai, his voice higher-pitched and filled with the glee of a child. \\"Yes, they are. Do you want to play a game, Rai?\\" Lily asked sweetly, her powers embracing the change with ease. \\"Yeah, let's play tag!\\" young Rai cheered, not even a fragment of his former age-appropriate ambitions left in his excited request. With a knowing smile, Lily started a game of tag in the meadow, leading Rai in a playful chase. Each burst of laughter from the boy seemed to seal his fate a bit more. After several minutes, Lily pretended to tire and suggested they return to the picnic blanket for a treat. \\"Okay, but can we have honey tarts? They're my favorite!\\" Rai pleaded, clapping his smaller hands together, utterly unaware of how the day had shifted so drastically. \\"We can have whatever you'd like, Rai,\\" Lily said, her voice nurturing as she guided him back to their spot. **[d20 Regression Resistance Roll: 3 + existing charm penalties: -8]** The boy looked up at Lily, the teenage worries and interests distant like a half-forgotten dream, as he entertained new thoughts about playing with wooden knights and building forts from the blankets. His transformation into a child seemed almost complete, but would he regress even further or somehow find the strength to resist Lily's enchanting powers? At this point, only a high roll could turn the tide and help Rai reclaim his teenaged self, as the layers of enchantment built upon him, deepening his susceptibility to Lily’s charms."},{"prompt":"欸","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？如果你有任何问题或者需要信息，请随时告诉我！"},{"prompt":"畫一張五條悟","completion":"很抱歉，作为一个文本基础的AI，我无法直接创造或展示图像。但是我可以描述五条悟这个角色，你可以根据描述来想象或画出他。 五条悟是日本漫画《咒术回战》中的人物，他是一个高大帅气的男性角色，以冷静且幽默的个性和强大的咒术能力著称。以下是他的一些特征： 1. 头发：五条悟的头发是银白色，留着一个时尚的短发造型。 2. 眼罩：他的最显著特征是他的眼罩，他经常佩戴着一个覆盖左眼的黑色眼罩。 3. 瞳孔：在不佩戴眼罩时，可以看到他的瞳孔是蓝色的，给人一种神秘感。 4. 衣着：通常穿着咒术高等院的教师制服，包括一件长袖的黑色高领衣和黑色裤子，外面穿着一件长袍风格的外套。 5. 风格：五条悟给人一种轻松自在，时而不正经，时而极端认真的印象。 如果你想要五条悟的具体画像，推荐查找专业的插画或漫画资源，或者通过搜索引擎查询他的动漫形象。"},{"prompt":"Du bist ein professioneller Country Manager bei dem Unternehmen Katjes und willst veganes Fruchtgummi in Thailand vermarkten. Ich habe schon einiges recherchiert und würde dich bitten meine Informationen die bereits bestehen zu erweitern oder passende Informationen zusätzlich anzufügen: \\"Katjes: International Sales und Marketing für das Geschäftsfeld Thailand I. Einführung 1.1 Background: Entwicklung des veganen Marktes weltweit und in Thailand Weltweit steigt die Nachfrage nach pflanzlichen und veganen Lebensmitteln, und Thailand ist keine Ausnahme. Immer mehr Verbraucher suchen nach gesunden und nachhaltigen Alternativen, die frei von tierischen Inhaltsstoffen sind. Einzigartige Positionierungsmöglichkeiten in Thailand Während in westlichen Märkten der Wettbewerb in der veganen Süßigkeitenkategorie bereits hoch sein könnte, ist dieser Markt in Thailand noch nicht wirklich umkämpft. Das ermöglicht Katjes, als einer der ersten komplett veganen Marktteilnehmer Fuß zu fassen und eine starke Position aufzubauen. Der Export von veganen Produkten nach Thailand könnte für Katjes also eine wirtschaftlich lohnende Geschäftsmöglichkeit darstellen. II. Marktpotenzial in Thailand 2.1 Warum sollte Katjes sein veganes Sortiment in Thailand verkaufen? Nachfolgend haben wir einige Gründe aufgelistet, warum Katjes seine veganen Produkte in Thailand verkaufen sollte: Vegane Kultur Die vegane Bewegung in Thailand wächst stetig, und es gibt eine steigende Anzahl von Menschen, die sich für eine vegane Lebensweise entscheiden. Der Markt für vegane Produkte ist somit vielversprechend. Kulturelle Akzeptanz In Thailand sind viele traditionelle Gerichte bereits pflanzlich oder können in fast allen Restaurants ganz leicht in vegane Versionen umgewandelt werden. Daher besteht eine gewisse Offenheit gegenüber veganen Produkten, was den Markteintritt für Katjes erleichtern könnte. Touristen und Ausländer Thailand ist ein beliebtes Reiseziel für Touristen und Expatriates aus verschiedenen Ländern. Viele von ihnen bevorzugen vegane Lebensmittel, was eine zusätzliche Zielgruppe für Katjes schafft. 2.2 Aktuelle Wettbewerbssituation: Die Konkurrenzmarken wie “Haribo” und “Trolli” sind mit bereits mit veganen Produkten vertreten Wettbewerb 2024 Die aktuelle Wettbewerbssituation zeigt, dass bisher die deutschen Konkurrenzmarken Haribo sowie auch Trolli zwei bzw. ein veganes Produkt in Thailand anbieten. Dies könnte eine Chance für Katjes darstellen, in diesen aufstrebenden Markt einzutreten und als einer der Pioniere die Kategorie zu prägen. Eine frühzeitige Etablierung könnte Katjes eine starke Marktposition verschaffen. Vor allem mit dem riesigen und vielseitigen Angebot an veganen Produkten könnte Katjes in einem gewissen Zeitraum der Marktführer für unter anderem Fruchtgummi in Thailand werden. Lohnt sich Thailand als Geschäftsfeld? - Haribo macht es vor! Die Tatsache, dass Haribo bereits seit Jahren in verschiedenen Märkten wie 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Tops, Central, Big C, Makro, MaxValu, Villa Market, Lotus und Tesco Lotus in Thailand aktiv ist, zeigt, dass das Geschäftsfeld für Fruchtgummis in Thailand durchaus attraktiv ist. Da die Nachfrage nach veganen Produkten steigt und die vegane Bewegung in Thailand wächst, könnte dies eine vielversprechende Gelegenheit für Katjes sein, von diesem Trend zu profitieren und das Geschäftsfeld in Thailand zu erschließen. III. Vegane Entwicklung in Thailand 3.1 Vegane Kultur und Geschichte: Der vegane Trend in Thailand hat in den letzten Jahren ein bemerkenswertes Wachstum erlebt und gewinnt zunehmend an Popularität. Die thailändische Gesellschaft zeigt ein wachsendes Interesse an einer gesunden und nachhaltigen Lebensweise, was dazu führt, dass immer mehr Menschen sich für eine vegane Ernährung entscheiden. Diese Entwicklung spiegelt sich in einer Vielzahl von veganen Angeboten und Aktivitäten wider, die sowohl von Einheimischen als auch von Touristen geschätzt werden. Buddhismus und ethische Haltung Die vegane Kultur Thailands ist eng mit den traditionellen buddhistischen Werten und der Achtung vor allen Lebewesen verbunden. Buddhismus ist die vorherrschende Religion in Thailand, und viele Buddhisten praktizieren eine vegetarische oder vegane Ernährung als Ausdruck von Mitgefühl und Respekt gegenüber Tieren. Während nicht alle Thailänderinnen und Thailänder eine vegane Ernährung verfolgen, hat diese ethische Haltung gegenüber Tieren zweifellos zur Verbreitung und Akzeptanz veganer Lebensmittel in der Gesellschaft beigetragen. Historische Jay-Ernährung Historisch gesehen hatte Thailand bereits vor der aktuellen weltweiten Veganismus-Bewegung eine vielfältige Palette an pflanzlichen Gerichten, die als \\"Jay\\" (auch bekannt als Jai oder Jaym), eine Art pflanzliche Ernährungsweise, bezeichnet werden. Dieser Begriff bezieht sich auf eine diätetische Praxis, bei der Menschen bestimmte Tage des Monats oder religiöse Anlässe nutzen, um rein pflanzliche Gerichte zu konsumieren. Das Jay-Konzept ist eng mit den buddhistischen Riten verbunden und wird von Anhängern des Buddhismus sowie von Menschen verschiedener Glaubensrichtungen respektiert. 3.2 Aktuelle Entwicklung: Wachstum von veganen Optionen In den letzten Jahren haben sich jedoch die veganen Möglichkeiten in Thailand erheblich erweitert. Vor allem in urbanen Zentren wie Bangkok, Chiang Mai und Phuket, aber auch auf den südlichen Inseln, wie Koh Phangan, Koh Samui oder Koh Tao gibt es eine Vielzahl von veganen Restaurants, Cafés und Straßenständen, die eine breite Palette an rein pflanzlichen Speisen anbieten. Dabei reicht das Angebot von traditionellen thailändischen Gerichten, die für die vegane Ernährung abgewandelt wurden, bis hin zu international inspirierten veganen Köstlichkeiten. Veranstaltungen und Festivals Die Aufmerksamkeit für vegane Ernährung hat auch zu einer wachsenden Zahl von Veranstaltungen, Festivals und Messen geführt, die sich ausschließlich dem Thema Veganismus widmen. Diese Veranstaltungen ziehen sowohl Einheimische als auch internationale Besucher an und fördern den Austausch von Informationen, Erfahrungen und Innovationen im Bereich der pflanzlichen Ernährung. IV. Chancen für deutsche Produkte 4.1 Beliebtheit deutscher Marken: Positive Reputation Deutsche Produkte, insbesondere Lebensmittel, genießen auf dem asiatischen Kontinent einen guten Ruf für Qualität und Authentizität. Dieses positive Image könnte für Katjes von Vorteil sein, wenn sie ihre Produktpalette nach Thailand exportieren. Die Beliebtheit deutscher Marken könnte dazu beitragen, das Interesse der thailändischen Verbraucher an den Produkten von Katjes zu steigern. Beispiele für bekannte deutsche Lebensmittelmarken/ -produkte Toffifee , Nimm2, Ritter Sport, Haribo, Trolli, Bahlsen, Lorenz, Corny, Leibniz Europäische Marken sind bereits in thailändischen Regalen zu finden Viele bekannte internationale Lebensmittelmarken aus Europa bieten ihre Produkte bereits in thailändischen Supermärkten und Geschäften an. Nachfolgend haben wir einige Hersteller aufgelistet: Oatly (Schweden) Lindt (Schweiz) Ferrero (Italien) Nestlé (Schweiz) Lotus Bakeries (Belgien) Cookie Factory Merba B.V. (Niederlande) Butlers Chocolates (Irland) Van Houten (Niederlande) Milka (Schweiz) Walkers (Vereinigtes Königreich) V. Vorteile für Katjes in Thailand Die Tatsache, dass es nur begrenzt eine Konkurrenz bei veganen Fruchtgummis von Katjes in Thailand gibt, könnte eine hervorragende Gelegenheit für das Unternehmen darstellen, den Markt zu dominieren und eine starke Präsenz aufzubauen. Nachfolgend haben wir einige Gründe aufgelistet, warum diese Situation von Vorteil sein könnte: 5.1 Begrenzte Konkurrenz für vegane Produkte von Katjes in Thailand Erster Markteintritt Als einziger Big Player von veganen Fruchtgummis hätte Katjes in Thailand die Möglichkeit, direkt in den Markt Fuß zu fassen und sich einen signifikanten Marktanteil zu sichern. Dies gibt dem Unternehmen einen Wettbewerbsvorteil und ermöglicht es, die Verbraucher direkt anzusprechen, ohne von bestehenden Marken abgelenkt zu werden. Monopolstellung Durch ein großes Sortiment von veganen Fruchtgummis könnte Katjes eine Art Monopolstellung genießen, zumindest vorerst. Diese Positionierung würde es dem Unternehmen ermöglichen, die Preise und das Marketing nach eigenem Ermessen zu gestalten, um die maximale Wirkung zu erzielen. Konsumentenbindung Wenn Katjes in Thailand als erster Anbieter von ausschließlich veganen Fruchtgummis wahrgenommen wird, könnte dies zu einer starken Konsumentenbindung führen. Die Verbraucher könnten die Marke als Pionier und Trendsetter wahrnehmen, was langfristige Loyalität und Wiederholungskäufe begünstigen könnte. Markenbekanntheit Die Tatsache, dass es so gut wie keine Konkurrenz (ausgenommen das Produkt: Dinorex (vegan) von Trolli) gibt, könnte auch die Aufmerksamkeit der Verbraucher auf Katjes lenken. Eine gut durchdachte Marketingstrategie könnte dazu beitragen, die Markenbekanntheit schnell zu steigern und das Bewusstsein für die veganen Produkte von Katjes in Thailand zu schärfen. Anmerkung: Es ist jedoch wichtig zu bedenken, dass die Situation des fehlenden Wettbewerbs möglicherweise nicht dauerhaft sein wird. Wenn der Markt für vegane Süßigkeiten in Thailand wächst und sich entwickelt, könnten andere Unternehmen ebenfalls Interesse an diesem Bereich zeigen. Daher sollte Katjes diese Gelegenheit nutzen, um ihre Marke und Produkte in Thailand gut zu etablieren und eine starke Position aufzubauen, um mögliche zukünftige Konkurrenten zu bewältigen. 5.2 Produktanpassungen für den thailändischen Markt Durch spezielle Produktanpassungen kann Katjes das Interesse der thailändischen Verbraucher wecken und ihre Produkte an den lokalen Geschmack und optisch von der Verpackung an die Kultur anpassen. Die genannten Editionen könnten sich wie folgt präsentieren: Spezielle Editionen für den thailändischen Markt Thailand Edition: Produkte, die in der Gestaltung und den Aromen thailändischer Elemente aufgreifen, um die lokale Identifikation zu stärken. Dschungel Edition: Mit exotischen Geschmacksrichtungen und Verpackungen, die die faszinierende thailändische Dschungel-Umgebung widerspiegeln. Island Edition: Produkte, die den tropischen Inseln Thailands gewidmet sind, mit frischen und erfrischenden Aromen. Fruit Edition: (Tropen-Früchte): Eine Auswahl an Fruchtgummis mit authentischen tropischen Früchten aus Thailand. Full Moon Edition: Da der Vollmond eine bedeutende Rolle in der thailändischen Kultur und Tradition spielt, könnte eine Fullmoon Edition eine besondere Verbindung zu den thailändischen Verbrauchern herstellen und eine einzigartige Marketingkampagne ermöglichen. We Bare Bears Edition: Die US-Zeichentrickserie We Bare Bears ist in Asien sehr beliebt. Die Hauptfiguren Grizzly, Panda und Eisbär sind drei Bären, die als Brüder in einer Höhle leben und versuchen, die Lebensbewältigung in einer Großstadt zu meistern. Mit einer entsprechenden Edition könnte die Serie ein guter Werbepartner für Katjes werden. Wechselnde Limited Edition: Regelmäßige Sondereditionen mit saisonalen Geschmacksrichtungen und Verpackungen, um die Aufmerksamkeit der Verbraucher aufrechtzuerhalten. Anpassung von Geschmacksrichtungen Thailändische Verbraucher schätzen traditionelle tropische Früchte, daher könnten Geschmacksrichtungen wie Banane, Ananas, Mango, Erdbeere und Kokosnuss in den Produkten von Katjes gut ankommen. Diese Aromen sind in der thailändischen Küche allgegenwärtig und könnten somit einen lokalen Bezug herstellen und das Interesse der Konsumenten wecken. VI. Strategische Überlegungen 6.1 Bangkok: Die meistbesuchteste Stadt der Welt 2023 Tourismuszahlen 2023 Im Verlauf des Jahres 2023 kamen etwa 25 Millionen internationale Besucher nach Bangkok, was zu einem Gesamterlös von rund 2,38 Billionen Baht (ungefähr 64,50 Milliarden Euro) führte. Thailand: Award für das beste Reiseziel in der Region Asien-Pazifik Bei den Travel Weekly Asia Readers‘ Choice Awards 2023 wurde Thailand zum besten Reiseziel in der Region Asien-Pazifik gekürt. Experten der Reisebranche haben im Zeitraum vom 8. Juni bis zum 28. Juli 2023 die Gewinner der Travel Weekly Asia Readers' Choice Awards 2023 ausgewählt. Diese Auszeichnungen wurden an herausragende Reiseveranstalter und -lieferanten vergeben, die sich durch Innovation, Professionalität und Exzellenz in ihren spezifischen Fachbereichen ausgezeichnet haben. Ziele für nachhaltigen Tourismus in Thailand Thailand hat sich für die Jahre 2023 bis 2027 klare Ziele gesetzt, um den positiven Trend im Tourismus fortzusetzen und die Qualität sowie Nachhaltigkeit zu verbessern. Dabei möchte das Land seine \\"Smart Power\\" einsetzen, um einen hochwertigen und nachhaltigen Tourismus zu fördern und voranzutreiben. VII. Werbekampagnen 7.1 Vegetarian Festival Thailand 2024: Nine Emperor Gods Festival Das Nine Emperor Gods Festival, auch als Vegetarian Festival oder Jay-Festival bekannt, ist ein traditionelles chinesisches Fest, das von Anhängern des taoistischen Glaubens gefeiert wird. Das Festival erstreckt sich über neun Tage und findet im neunten Monat des chinesischen Mondkalenders statt, was normalerweise in den Monaten September oder Oktober des gregorianischen Kalenders fällt. Ein interessanter Aspekt des Nine Emperor Gods Festivals ist die betonte vegane Ernährung während der Festtage. Viele Gläubige entscheiden sich, für die Dauer des Festivals ausschließlich pflanzliche Lebensmittel zu konsumieren. Diese Entscheidung basiert auf dem Glauben, dass eine rein vegane Ernährung zur spirituellen Reinigung beiträgt und die körperliche und geistige Gesundheit fördert. Verbindung zwischen Festival und veganem Lebensstil Die Verbindung zwischen dem Nine Emperor Gods Festival und dem veganen Lebensstil verdeutlicht, wie kulturelle und religiöse Praktiken oft mit Ernährungsgewohnheiten und einem nachhaltigen Lebensstil verbunden sind. Während dieser Festlichkeiten wird nicht nur die spirituelle Reinigung betont, sondern auch die Bedeutung einer pflanzlichen Ernährung als Ausdruck von Respekt gegenüber dem Leben und der Natur. Die Feierlichkeiten sind in vielen Teilen Südostasiens, besonders in Thailand, Malaysia und Singapur, verbreitet. Teilnahme und Präsenz von Katjes Die Präsenz von Katjes auf dem Vegetarian Festival wäre eine sinnvolle und bedeutungsvolle Ergänzung. Als Unternehmen, das sich auf vegetarische bzw. vermehrt auf vegane Süßigkeiten spezialisiert hat, könnte Katjes eine ideale Wahl für ein Festival sein, um die Bedeutung von pflanzlichen Produkten zu steigern. Durch die Teilnahme am Vegetarian Festival könnte Katjes nicht nur seine Produkte präsentieren, sondern auch eine außergewöhnliche Plattform nutzen, um das Engagement des Unternehmens für nachhaltige und tierfreundliche Produkte zu betonen und mit Zielgruppen in Kontakt zu treten, die besonders an vegetarischen bzw. veganen Themen interessiert sind. Mit der Einrichtung von Ständen bei den Hauptevents in Städten wie Bangkok, Phuket und Chiang Mai sowie auf den beliebten Inseln Koh Tao, Koh Phangan und Koh Samui würde Katjes eine breite und vielfältige Zielgruppe erreichen. Diese Standorte sind nicht nur touristisch die attraktivsten Ziele in Thailand, sondern auch Zentren für kulturelle Feierlichkeiten, was die Reichweite und Wirkung der Präsenz von Katjes in ganz Thailand erheblich steigern könnte.\\"","completion":"Auf Basis der bereits vorhandenen Informationen könnten folgende zusätzliche Aspekte oder Erweiterungen wichtig sein, um die Vermarktung von veganem Fruchtgummi von Katjes in Thailand weiter zu stärken: **Partnerschaften mit lokalen Einzelhändlern:** Es könnte hilfreich sein, spezielle Partnerschaften mit thailändischen Einzelhändlern einzugehen. Fokusläden, die Naturprodukte, gesunde Lebensmittel und spezialisierte vegane Produkte verkaufen, könnten ideale Partner sein, um Katjes-Produkte prominent zu platzieren. **Online-Vertrieb und E-Commerce:** Erwägen Sie eine Online-Vertriebsstrategie durch thailändische E-Commerce-Plattformen wie Lazada, Shopee oder die länderspezifischen Amazon-Seiten. Gerade in urbanen Regionen erfreuen sich Online-Käufe wachsender Beliebtheit. **Einbindung der lokalen Gemeinschaft:** Arbeiten Sie mit thailändischen Influencern und Bloggern zusammen, die sich auf vegane Ernährung spezialisieren, um Markenbekanntheit zu schaffen und Authentizität zu demonstrieren. Influencer-Marketing ist ein effektiver Weg, um Vertrauen und Interesse an der Marke bei der Zielgruppe aufzubauen. **Nachhaltigkeitszertifikate und Umweltbewusstsein:** Angesichts der weltweit zunehmenden Wichtigkeit von Nachhaltigkeit sollte Katjes das Engagement für Umweltschutz und soziale Verantwortung betonen. Dies könnte durch die Zertifizierung von Produkten nach international anerkannten Standards wie „Carbon Neutral“ oder „Rainforest Alliance Certified“ erreicht werden. **Lokale Geschmackstests und Kundeneinbindung:** Veranstalten Sie Verkostungsevents an Orten mit hoher Fußgängerfrequenz, um direktes Feedback zum Produkt zu erhalten und gleichzeitig die Markenpräsenz zu erhöhen. **Anpassung an thailändische Feiertage und Festivals:** Neben dem Vegetarian Festival, könnte Katjes spezielle Sondereditionen zu anderen bedeutenden Festen wie dem bekannten Wasserfest Songkran oder dem Lichterfest Loi Krathong herausbringen. **Bildung und Information:** Setzen Sie auf Bildungskampagnen, um die Vorteile veganer Lebensmittel besser zu vermitteln. Dies könnte durch Zusammenarbeit mit Gesundheits- und Ernährungsexperten oder durch Aufklärungskampagnen in sozialen Medien und an Veranstaltungsorten erfolgen. **Anpassung der Marketingbotschaft:** Die Marketingkampagnen sollten die thailändische Kultur respektvoll einbinden. Botschaften, die auf thailändischen Werten, wie Familiensinn oder Respekt vor der Natur, aufbauen, könnten hervorragend zur Markenidentität von Katjes passen. **Kooperationen mit Hotels und dem Gastgewerbe:** Thailand hat ein starkes Netzwerk im Gastgewerbe und viele Hotels mit Schwerpunkt auf Gesundheit und Wellness. Ein Vertriebskanal über diese Einrichtungen könnte Sichtbarkeit und Reichweite von Katjes-Produkten bei der gesundheitsbewussten Zielgruppe erhöhen. **CSR-Aktivitäten:** Durch die Beteiligung an lokalen sozialen Projekten oder Umweltinitiativen kann Katjes das Firmenimage als sozial verantwortliches Unternehmen stärken. Dies schafft Goodwill und eine positive Assoziation mit der Marke. Eine sorgfältige Anpassung dieser Vorschläge und weiterer innovativer Marketingansätze kann dazu beitragen, dass Katjes in Thailand erfolgreich ist und sich als führende Marke im Bereich veganer Fruchtgummis etablieren kann."},{"prompt":"Hello there!","completion":"Hello!

Welcome back to Toon Talks, where we dissect the latest trends in animation and kids' TV! Today, I've got a hot topic for all you Disney XD EMEA viewers out there. It seems like our beloved channel has taken a detour down memory lane, with a heavy rotation of classics like \\"Phineas and Ferb,\\" \\"Gravity Falls,\\" \\"Recess,\\" and \\"Yin Yang Yo.\\" But what does this mean for the fledgling mystical gem, \\"The Owl House\\"? Let's dive into it! Nostalgia Reigns Supreme You don't have to be a TV executive to notice that nostalgia sells, and Disney XD EMEA is banking on that. \\"Phineas and Ferb's\\" endless summer escapades, the Pines twins' weird and wonderful adventures in \\"Gravity Falls,\\" the recess gang's schoolyard shenanigans, and the comedic martial arts misfits of \\"Yin Yang Yo\\" – Disney XD is hitting us hard with the comfort shows of the past decade. Every time I flick on the TV, I'm greeted by these timeless classics that cater to a sense of wistful yearning. It's like walking into a living room smelling of fresh cookies. It's warm, it's cozy, it's familiar. The Owl House: Lost in the Shuffle? Enter \\"The Owl House,\\" an inventive new series that's been lauded for its engaging storytelling, diverse characters, and inventive magical realms. Despite critical acclaim and a passionate fan base, it seems to be struggling to find its footing in the ratings race. The dilemma here is twofold: On one hand, the older shows are tried and proven – they pull in viewers who love re-living their earlier cartoon-watching days. On the other hand, they tend to overshadow newer quality content that's trying to emerge and establish a viewership. A Ratings Conundrum What we're seeing with \\"The Owl House\\" is what I'd like to call a 'ratings conundrum'. When you have a channel saturated with beloved legacy content, it's tough for new blood to compete. This series has the potential to become the next big thing, but it's being stifled by an abundance of the \\"good ol' days.\\" Our current data suggests that Disney XD EMEA's scheduling might not be doing \\"The Owl House\\" any favors. The show's airtime often coincides with less peak viewing hours, while the classics dominate the after-school and weekend prime slots – the golden time real estate for kids' programming. The Balancing Act It's a classic case of balancing the old with the new. Disney XD EMEA needs to strike a compromise that promotes new content without dismissing what attracts their loyal viewers. Perhaps more innovative marketing or creating events for shows like \\"The Owl House\\" could spark interest without disrupting the allure of nostalgia. Another idea might involve leveraging those popular shows to introduce the new ones. Imagine a \\"magical mysteries\\" marathon that starts with a couple of episodes of \\"Gravity Falls\\" and then leads into new episodes of \\"The Owl House.\\" Viewers already tuned in for Dipper and Mabel might just stick around to see what Luz and King are up to. Conclusion In the end, it's all about giving new stories a chance to grow while respecting the old ones that have shaped the landscape of children's television. For \\"The Owl House\\" to cast its spell over the viewers, Disney XD EMEA might need to revisit the drawing board when it comes to their broadcasting strategy. Here's hoping that they find that magical formula that allows for the old magic to thrive alongside the new. What do you think, Toon Talkers? Is nostalgia getting in the way of innovation, or is there room for both on Disney XD EMEA? Share your thoughts in the comments below, and don’t forget to tune in next time for more animation chatter!"},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical - What are some names for a 17th century Royalist Commander?","completion":"In creating a name for a hypothetical 17th-century Royalist commander, we should consider the cultural and historical context of that period, especially referencing the English Civil War where the term \\"Royalist\\" (supporters of King Charles I) was commonly used. Typically, such a figure would have a given name that is common for the era, followed by a family name with potential inclusion of a title reflecting their status or the name of their ancestral lands. Here are some examples: 1. Sir Edward Montague 2. General William Cavendish 3. Lord Thomas Fairfax 4. Colonel Henry Wentworth 5. Captain Arthur Capell 6. Sir George Lisle 7. Major Richard Talbot 8. Baron Robert Stuart 9. Sir John Gage 10. Captain Francis Hawley 11. Lord Algernon Percy 12. Brigadier Anthony Van Dyck 13. Lieutenant Colonel James Stanley 14. Sir Geoffrey Clarendon 15. Charles Radclyffe, Earl of Derwentwater Each of these names includes an element of military rank (e.g., General, Colonel, Captain) and noble title (e.g., Sir, Lord, Baron), which would have been typical of Royalist commanders during that period. Surnames are chosen to sound plausibly of the era, with some referencing real Royalist families for added authenticity. Keep in mind that in actual 17th-century England, not all commanders would have had noble titles; some could have risen from the ranks of the gentry or have been knighted for their military services."},{"prompt":"How might the arrival of a female dressed in the garb of the 'progressive' early 1970's have been met by such people?","completion":"If we imagine a scenario where a woman dressed in the early 1970s progressive fashion were to somehow arrive in the 17th century during the English Civil War, her reception would depend significantly on various factors, including the specific location and the prevailing attitudes of the people she encountered. However, it's safe to assume the experience would be profoundly jarring for both the woman and those 17th-century individuals due to the stark contrasts in culture, social norms, and clothing. Here are likely reactions she might encounter: 1. **Shock and Confusion**: The 17th-century society would be bewildered by her appearance, as her clothing would be drastically different from anything they had seen. Women in the 17th century were expected to wear modest dresses with corsets, full skirts, and covered shoulders. In contrast, clothing from the early 1970s could include mini skirts, bell-bottom pants, tie-dye shirts—all of which would be revealing and unconventional to the 17th-century eye. 2. **Suspicion and Fear**: People from the 17th century might be suspicious of her intentions and origins, possibly thinking she's a witch, a foreign spy, or a harbinger of ill omens due to her outlandish attire and unfamiliar behavior. 3. **Moral Outrage**: Given the conservative nature of society, particularly among Royalists who often adhered to traditionalist views, many would find her dress deeply inappropriate and offensive. Morality standards of the time dictated modesty for women, and deviation from those norms could provoke harsh judgment or even punishment. 4. **Curiosity**: Some might be genuinely curious about her and the world she comes from. Forward-thinking individuals or those with a keen interest in innovation and the outside world might wish to learn about her clothing materials, the design, and what societal changes led to such fashion. 5. **Hostile Action**: Depending on the context, she could face arrest or detainment for indecency, or they might insist she covers up with more appropriate clothing of that era. She would certainly be encouraged—if not forced—to conform to their norms to avoid public disorder. 6. **Protective Hospitality**: Perhaps a few sympathetic individuals might be inclined to shelter her from the public's potentially volatile reaction, offering her refuge and guidance in navigating this dangerous anachronistic environment. It's worth noting that the way a person from the 17th century interprets her appearance would be framed by their knowledge and worldview. Without any understanding of time travel or future cultural developments, they would likely try to fit her into their understanding of the world, possibly seeing her as a visitor from a foreign land with unusual customs. The progressive sociopolitical attitudes that her clothing might imply—greater gender equality, freedom of expression, and individualism—would be nothing short of revolutionary and incomprehensible to most 17th-century folks."},{"prompt":"If the hairstyle isn't too femme, they might conciveably mistake her for teenage male , albiet in unusual breeches?","completion":"It's conceivable that if a woman from the early 1970s with a less feminine hairstyle—such as a short pixie cut, which was fashionable at the time—were wearing clothing that obscured her figure, she could be mistaken for a teenage male, especially if she had on attire that resembled breeches and a tunic or shirt. During the 17th century, men's fashion did include breeches, doublets, and the like, so a particularly androgynous outfit from the 1970s—perhaps flared trousers and a loose-fitting shirt—might not be immediately recognized as women's clothing by people of the era. However, several factors would still raise eyebrows: 1. **Fabric and Patterns**: The materials and designs used in 1970s clothing, such as synthetic fabrics and bold patterns, would be noticeably different from the natural fibers and more subdued colors or brocades of the 17th century. 2. **Fit and Cut**: The cut of 1970s clothing was significantly different, even for men's fashion. While 17th-century breeches were more snug, flared trousers from the 1970s would be loose at the knee and flare outward, a style unfamiliar to that era. 3. **Accessories and Details**: The lack of 17th-century appropriate accessories, such as hats, ruffs, cloaks, and the proper shoes, would add to the peculiarity. Details like zippers, buttons in unconventional places, or modern branding would also be giveaways. 4. **Mannerisms and Speech**: Even if her clothing allowed the woman to initially pass as a male, differences in her mannerisms, speech, and behavior would likely quickly reveal her as a woman, or at the very least as someone not from their time and place. 5. **Social Interaction**: While women in the 17th century had certain restrictions on their behavior and movements in public, teenage males would also be expected to follow societal norms and etiquette. If this woman from the 1970s did not behave as a 17th-century male should, her gender disguise might be seen through quite quickly. It should be noted that someone who did not conform to gender norms of the period could face serious consequences, as non-conformity could be interpreted as subversion or even an affront to the natural order and divinely sanctioned gender roles. Nonetheless, assuming the best-case scenario in which she is mistaken for a young man, she may encounter less hostility or moral outrage than if she were immediately identified as a woman in men's clothing."},{"prompt":"A different challange , A female 'Traveller' styled in a more professional look of the late 40's arrives in 1929 New York.. Assuming a more conservative style befiting an older charcter, would they get mistaken for being 'Temperance' ?","completion":"A woman dressed in the conservative, professional fashion of the late 1940s arriving in New York City of 1929 could potentially blend in quite well, despite the subtle differences in style between the two decades. Fashion from the late 1940s was influenced, in part, by the austerity of World War II, with more structured and tailored garments, while the styles of the late 1920s were a bit more relaxed and embellished, reflecting the prosperous \\"Roaring Twenties.\\" Key fashion elements of the late 1940s include padded shoulders, knee-length skirts, modest blouses, and perhaps a hat for a professional woman. This was also a time when women increasingly participated in the workforce due to the war, leading to more practical and tailored clothing that still maintained elements of femininity. As for whether she would be mistaken for being part of the Temperance movement, it's unlikely for a few reasons: 1. **Professional Wear**: Professional-looking attire would not necessarily be an indicator of Temperance affiliation. Many women, particularly those working in more conservative fields like law, education, or business, would wear similar styles. 2. **Tailoring**: The tailored look of late-1940s clothing would not be out of place in 1929, as women were donning more shaped and styled clothing after the looser fashions of the early 1920s. 3. **Temperance Association**: The Temperance movement was known for advocating the prohibition of alcohol and was linked with moral and religious overtones which went beyond mere clothing. A woman would more likely be associated with Temperance based on her behavior, activism, and outspokenness on the issue, rather than her dress alone. 4. **Period Transition**: By 1929, fashion was on the cusp of transitioning from the flapper styles of the mid-1920s into a slightly more conservative look that would characterize the early 1930s due to the oncoming Great Depression. This shift in style would make her less conspicuous. That said, assuming she carries herself with a certain level of austerity and conservatism in her demeanor and avoids typical '29 social practices like visiting speakeasies, she might be seen as someone with traditionalist sensibilities. Also, given the importance of accessories and minor style differences in period fashion, if she wore clothing that was anachronistically late 1940s, some New Yorkers, particularly those with an eye for fashion, might note the discrepancies and find it unusual or out of place. However, if her clothing was conservatively styled but not hitting specific late 40s signature trends (like the extreme shoulder padding), she could very well pass without significant comment as a professional woman of her supposed time in 1929."},{"prompt":"Hmm... Looks like \\"The Traveller\\" (who voyages through time and space might make some concessions to period of any given serial then.. but she doesn't wear feathers ever...","completion":"Indeed, if \\"The Traveller\\" is a character who journeys through different periods in time (akin to characters like Doctor Who or the protagonists of books like \\"Outlander\\"), it would be plausible for her to make adjustments to her clothing to fit the era she's visiting, while maintaining certain personal style preferences or restrictions, such as not wearing feathers. This helps solidify her character consistency and also can be a plot device to distinguish her from the era's natives. Here's how \\"The Traveller\\" might approach blending into various time periods while respecting her no-feathers rule: 1. **Research**: Before traveling, she may research the period-specific fashion trends to ensure her attire is appropriate for the era she's going to visit. This could be done through books, images, or perhaps even a \\"virtual fitting room\\" if she has access to advanced time-travel technology. 2. **Period Wardrobe**: She might have a wardrobe of period-appropriate outfits to choose from, catering to various historical eras, including the late 1920s, as in your example. These outfits would be designed to fit the general style of the time without including elements she doesn't wear, like feathers. 3. **Neutral Basics**: \\"The Traveller\\" could use neutral, timeless basics that can blend in across multiple decades. A simple blouse, skirt, and a coat could be accessorized differently to match various periods. 4. **Custom-made Garments**: If \\"The Traveller\\" has been time-traveling for a while, she may have garments custom-made to her specifications, avoiding unwanted elements like feathers and perhaps using futuristic materials that mimic the appropriate fabrics of any given period. 5. **Accessorizing**: She can use period-appropriate accessories to complement her look, making subtle adjustments while still following her no-feathers rule. For instance, instead of a feathered headpiece common in the 1920s, she might opt for a cloche hat or a ribbon. 6. **Character Story**: \\"The Traveller,\\" if questioned about her slightly out-of-time attire, could have a backstory as an eccentric or a forward-thinking individual from the current era she's visiting, allowing for some minor deviations from strict historical accuracy in her dress. By considering the cultural norms and styles of each period but also maintaining her personal fashion principles, \\"The Traveller\\" can respectfully and sensibly navigate through different points in history. This creates a flexible framework for the character that serves both narrative consistency and the need for historical adaptability."},{"prompt":"Grenfell's First TRaveller, is essentialy still Edwardian in dress sense, but this wouldn't necessarily be out of place for her in 1960's London, when people STILL wore relatively pre-war designs if they were of a certain age..","completion":"Indeed, it's not uncommon for people to retain the fashion sensibilities of an earlier period, especially if those styles coincide with their formative years, professional environment, or personal preferences. An Edwardian style in 1960s London wouldn't be the norm given the major shifts in fashion that took place post-WWII, but it wouldn't be entirely out of place either, particularly for a certain demographic. By the 1960s, fashion had become a form of personal expression and cultural change, with trends like the miniskirt, bold patterns, and psychedelic colors coming to the forefront, particularly among the youth and in settings associated with the Swinging Sixties movement. However, in certain contexts, traditional styles persisted: 1. **Conservative Dressers**: There were still individuals who preferred a more conservative or classical style of dress, particularly among older generations or those in formal professions like law, banking, or government. 2. **Formal Events**: Even during the 1960s, certain occasions—such as formal dinners, operas, or receptions—would call for traditional evening wear, which had changed very little since the Edwardian era. 3. **Cultural Preservation**: There would be groups and individuals who took pride in wearing or preserving traditional British attire, which could include elements of Edwardian fashion. 4. **Vintage and Retro Trends**: Vintage and retro clothing began to be appreciated as fashionable during the 60s, particularly among the bohemian crowds and those who frequented antique and second-hand stores. If Grenfell's First Traveller, dressed in an Edwardian manner, were to appear in 1960s London, there could be a few typical scenarios: - In professional or conservative circles, her fashion sense might be seen as somewhat outdated but still within the bounds of acceptable dress. - In trendy areas like Carnaby Street or King's Road, her attire would stand out more, but it might be chalked up to an eccentric personal style or a statement, since individual expression was highly valued. - In settings like a theatre or a classical concert, her clothing might attract attention but wouldn't be completely out of place, especially if it were an upscale event. For a character like Grenfell's First Traveller, who likely has a rich backstory and a developed personal style, navigating different periods would involve a delicate balance of blending in while retaining distinctive characteristics. Her attire could become a conversation starter, allowing her to engage with people from the era under the guise of being a collector or aficionado of Edwardian fashion, which could be a strategic advantage for her adventures."},{"prompt":"Jacques (2nd Traveller) has an eaiser time, she's essentially wears style contemporayr with the late 60's (when her era was) and with the exception into the Jacobite era, she's mostly in contemporary of futuristic settings.","completion":"Jacques, being the 2nd Traveller from a late-1960s contemporary setting, would indeed generally have an easier time blending into many time periods, especially if her travels are predominantly through contemporary (relative to her own time) or futuristic settings. The late 1960s was a time of great diversity in fashion, with both the presence of more traditional attire and the emergence of radically new styles, reflecting the social and cultural revolutions of the period. Given this flexibility, here's how Jacques could navigate various timelines: 1. **Contemporary Settings**: Late 1960s clothing would not be out of place in any setting from the 1950s up to the early 1970s due to overlapping fashion influences. Jacques' attire might be viewed as stylish or even slightly avant-garde, but not jarringly out of place in the context of the era. 2. **Futuristic Settings**: Jacques' late 1960s fashion could be seen as retro in futuristic environments, evoking a sense of nostalgia or timeless charm. Since we can't predict future trends with certainty, retro styles often become popular again in cycles, and her look may be appreciated for its classic appeal. 3. **The Jacobite Era**: In historical settings like the Jacobite era (the time of the Jacobite rebellions, mainly 18th century), she would stand out significantly. She would likely need to don period-appropriate attire to avoid drawing unwanted attention. It's interesting to note that someone from the 1960s would bring a perspective shaped by themes of resistance and counterculture, which could provide an intriguing lens through which to view the Jacobite struggles for the restoration of the Stuart monarchy. 4. **Cultural Adaptability**: Jacques could adapt her style as needed to blend in better with specific eras. The late 1960s saw a revival and appreciation of historical clothing styles—medieval, renaissance, and victorian—which she could use to her advantage when dressing for past eras. 5. **Character Interaction**: Contemporary and futuristic scenarios would allow Jacques to interact more freely with individuals from those periods, where her fashion sense may be viewed with curiosity, fondness for the past, or even trendsetting in a cyclical fashion world. 6. **Historical Knowledge**: Provided she has a good understanding of the times she visits, Jacques could modify her attire to align with the prevailing styles, thus avoiding the pitfalls of anachronism and ensuring smoother navigation of her travels. Jacques potentially embodies the spirit of the late 1960s, with an emphasis on exploration, openness to new ideas, and adaptability. Just like the era she represents, her approach to travel and fashion might be marked by a willingness to embrace change, learn from different cultures, and perhaps leave her own distinct mark on the timelines she visits."},{"prompt":"What might Jacques 2nd Traveller have decided on for a Jaccobite era , having realised she's in the Western Highlands? It can't be overly elaborate as she wants to blend in, but with enough status that she's respected.","completion":"To blend into the Jacobite era, particularly in the Western Highlands of Scotland, Jacques, the 2nd Traveller, would need to adopt clothing that resonates with the time period, which would be the early to mid-18th century, while not appearing out of place as a foreigner or an outsider of exceptionally high rank. Given her aim to achieve a balance between blending in and commanding respect, here is a potential outfit she might choose: 1. **Dress**: She would likely opt for a dress that is full-length and made from sturdy fabric like wool, which would be appropriate for the Highlands climate. The color would probably be a dark or earthy tone which was common at the time and suitable for travel. The dress would have simpler lines with a modest neckline to reflect the fashions of the era and the need for practicality in the Highlands. 2. **Plaid**: Adopting a plaid shawl or arisaid (a traditional women's garment similar to a man’s plaid but adapted for women, which could be wrapped around the body) could also lend authenticity to her appearance and offer versatility for changing weather. 3. **Apron and Bodice**: A plain linen apron would be practical and common for women of various social classes. She could also wear a fitted bodice over her dress, which could be laced or buttoned up the front, to accord with the styles of the period. 4. **Headwear**: Simple headwear such as a mob cap, a kerchief, or a bonnet would be suitable for a woman of her assumed station and would also serve to protect her from the elements. 5. **Footwear**: Practical boots or shoes with low heels, possibly made of leather, would be appropriate for traveling. 6. **Accessories**: Minimal accessories such as a simple neckerchief or a brooch to fasten the shawl might be included, as well as practical items like a leather belt with a pouch for carrying necessary items. 7. **Status Symbols**: As she wishes to command a measure of respect, Jacques could incorporate a few elements that subtly imply status, such as a well-made dress with quality fabric, though not too luxurious to avoid standing out too much. Carrying a well-crafted walking stick could also serve as both a practical item and a mark of stature. Jacques would also need to be mindful of the clan culture and politics at the time. Wearing tartan associated with a specific clan without having a claim to it could cause confusion or offense. Being knowledgeable about local customs, language (possibly picking up some Gaelic), and current affairs would also assist in earning respect and fitting in with the society of the time. By dressing in a manner that is practical, respectful of the era's modesty standards, and with just a slight edge of refinement, Jacques could navigate the Western Highlands during the Jacobite era effectively, maintaining both a low profile and a degree of authority."},{"prompt":"In a 7th Traveller (Lansbuyr) series serial \\"From The Trees\\" - They are on a forested jungle world. Lansbury traveller , opts for something that's more suited to a Tropical garden party, but does have a hat with mosquito netting.. The companion opts for slightly more sensible modern (for the late 80's) 'hiking' gear.","completion":"In the conceptual series featuring the 7th Traveller, Lansbury, the choice of attire for \\"From The Trees\\" reflects the need for practicality, comfort, and protection in a forested jungle world, while still retaining a sense of the character's unique style. Here are plausible outfit elements each character might choose: **Lansbury (The 7th Traveller):** - **Lightweight, Breathable Fabrics**: For a tropical garden party look, Lansbury would likely wear clothing made of lightweight and breathable fabrics such as linen or cotton to stay cool in the humid environment. - **Loose-fitting Clothing**: A loose-fitting, light-colored shirt paired with a flowing skirt or wide-legged trousers would allow for air circulation and freedom of movement, catering to both comfort and style. - **Protective Headwear**: A wide-brimmed hat, possibly made of straw or another light material, could provide shade from the sun. The mosquito netting attached to the hat would add practical protection against insects, which is a smart adaptation to the jungle environment. - **Footwear**: While keeping with the garden party theme, sensible shoes such as closed-toe flats or low-heeled boots would be chosen over high heels, providing better traction and protection from the terrain and wildlife. - **Accessories**: Accessories might include a stylish yet functional belt to cinch the waist of her garment, a decorative yet functional wristwatch, and a small satchel or pouch for essential items. **Companion:** - **Modern Hiking Gear**: Reflecting the practical late 1980s approach, the companion's attire could include cargo pants with multiple pockets, a moisture-wicking T-shirt, and perhaps a utility vest. - **Durable Footwear**: Sturdy hiking boots that are waterproof and provide ankle support would be ideal for navigating the jungle terrain. - **Hat and Sunglasses**: A brimmed hat like a baseball cap or boonie hat for sun protection, paired with sunglasses to shield her or his eyes from the glare. - **Backpack**: A backpack with necessary supplies such as water, snacks, insect repellent, sunscreen, a small first-aid kit, and perhaps a compact rain poncho, as tropical climates can have sudden downpours. - **Tools for Exploration**: The companion may also carry field tools such as a map, compass, binoculars, and a multi-tool, indicating preparedness for exploration and potential hazards. By each character dressing to reflect their respective personalities and approach to adventure—in the Traveller's case, an elegant and somewhat whimsical take on protective gear, and for the companion, a pragmatic and outdoor-ready demeanor—they're able to navigate the challenges of the jungle world in their own ways. Their attire and gear choices make them adaptable to the environment while still capturing the essence of their characters and roles within the story."},{"prompt":"The other characters, are what you might expect a contemporary for the production era expedition to have , The colony (of the Jungle world) director is in a slightly older style of tropical suit, but wears trousers.. A Mechanic has overalls.. Some of the other compound members seen might be in contemporary hiking gear.. they don't wear combats though..","completion":"In a late 1980s production set on a forested jungle world, the background characters would reflect a mix of styles that balance function with the aesthetics of the time. Here's how the attire of the other characters you described might be portrayed: **Colony Director:** - The director would likely wear a tropical suit that suggests authority and professionalism. The suit might be in a traditional style made of lightweight material suited for the tropics, such as a safari suit made from cotton or linen. - The suit jacket could be a more relaxed fit with practical features like large pockets. - The trousers would be lighter weight, allowing the director to move around the compound with ease, and could feature a high waist, which would be reminiscent of an older style. - The director may also wear a light, open-necked shirt beneath the jacket, and possibly suspenders for a touch of old-fashioned formality. - Footwear would be comfortable and durable, possibly leather shoes or boots suitable for walking around the compound but still formal enough to denote their rank. **Mechanic:** - The mechanic's attire would be practical, wearing overalls or coveralls that are sturdy and have multiple pockets for carrying tools. - Heavy-duty work boots would protect his feet, and he might wear a simple, short-sleeved undershirt beneath the overalls. - A rag or bandana could be worn around the neck or used to wipe away sweat, adding to the practical working look. - Despite the tropical heat, the material of the overalls would be durable to protect the mechanic from scrapes and spills. **Other Compound Members:** - As these members are part of an expedition or colony, contemporary late-1980s hiking gear would be common. They might wear lightweight cargo shorts or zip-off convertible pants and breathable cotton or synthetic shirts. - Hiking boots or trail shoes that offer comfort and protection would be prevalent footgear among the group. - Some might wear vests with pockets to carry gear, and hats with brims to protect from the sun, along with sunglasses. - Small daypacks or fanny packs would be common for personal items, tools, or supplies needed throughout the day. - Accessories like watches, insect repellent bands, and necessary gadgets for their roles within the compound would be visible. It's also worth mentioning that while these characters don't wear combat gear, they might still exhibit a utilitarian style that reflects the practical needs of living and working in such an environment. The director's slightly older fashion sense provides a visual cue of his status and possibly tenure within the colony, while the clothes of others still predominantly reflect functionality. This mix of contemporary, functional, and slightly dated styles creates a believable dynamic for the different roles within the jungle colony setting."},{"prompt":"One idea I had was that the director, looks like he's more in keeping with a British Colonial Adminstrator from the Inter war period (in say India or Singapore) ? A pale suit and Panama hat ?","completion":"That's a vivid and recognisable aesthetic, which could work very well for the character of the colony director. Drawing inspiration from the attire typical of British colonial administrators from the interwar period would help solidify his status as an authority figure with a touch of historical precedent and perhaps a nod to the traditional and conservative nature of his character. Here’s how you might envision his attire: - **Pale Suit**: The director would wear a pale tropical suit, also known as a safari suit, which could be linen or a lightweight cotton drill. Pale colors not only reflect the colonial style but also serve a practical purpose by being less absorbent of sunlight, thereby keeping the wearer cooler. - **Shirt**: Underneath the suit, the director may wear a crisp, white dress shirt, possibly with a stiff collar. It may be short-sleeved considering the tropical environment. - **Trousers**: The trousers would be of matching fabric to the jacket, high-waisted, with pleats for mobility and comfort. They would likely be wide-legged to provide air circulation. - **Panama Hat**: This classic lightweight straw hat would protect the director from the intense sun of the jungle world. The Panama hat is a traditional icon of tropical colonial fashion and would indicate a sense of dignity and rank. - **Footwear**: He might wear sturdy yet comfortable leather shoes, such as brogues or oxfords, in a color that complements the suit. - **Accessories**: The director could also carry accessories like a pocket watch, a walking stick, and perhaps even a monocle or spectacles to emphasize the old-world administrative aesthetic. A tie might be omitted due to the heat, but he could wear a tie on more formal occasions, or he could sport a cravat or neckerchief for a splash of color and flair. - **Grooming**: To complete the look, the director's grooming would be immaculate; clean-shaven with a neat haircut, reflecting the disciplined approach of the British colonial service. With these elements, the director's look ties in with the historical context of British colonial administration, giving him a presence that would command respect. It also creates a visual narrative about the director's character, hinting at someone who perhaps values order, tradition, and the decorum of a bygone era—a sharp contrast to the unpredictable wildness of the jungle world around him.

Используйте цикл для перебора элементов и условные операторы для проверки совпадений. - Если клавиша уже существует, то отобразите виджет подтверждения, используя метод \\"Create Widget\\" и метод \\"Add to Viewport\\" для показа виджета. 4. **Логика кнопок в виджете подтверждения:** - В Blueprint виджета добавьте события нажатия для каждой из кнопок (\\"Да\\" и \\"Нет\\"). - При нажатии на \\"Да\\" реализуйте логику сохранения изменений клавиши. - При нажатии на \\"Нет\\" реализуйте удаление виджета из вьюпорта или его скрытие. 5. **Тестирование:** - Тестируйте вашу систему на наличие ошибок и убедитесь, что виджет отображается, когда нужно, и что переназначение клавиш работает корректно. Это общие шаги. Конкретная реализация может быть более сложной в зависимости от того, какие конкретные требования и функционал представлен в вашем проекте. Также учтите, что визуальный скриптинг с помощью Blueprint может потребовать знания специфических нод и логик работы с ними в UE5."},{"prompt":"у меня есть событье on key selected из которого на выходе выбранная клавиша input chord ее нужно сравнить с существующими клавишами","completion":"Чтобы сравнить выбранную клавишу \`Input Chord\` с существующими клавишами в Unreal Engine 5, нужно будет выполнить следующие шаги: 1. **Получение текущих настроек управления:** Откройте ваш проект и найдите раздел \\"Input\\" в \\"Project Settings\\". Здесь будут перечислены все настроенные Action Mappings и Axis Mappings. Вам нужно будет получить доступ к этим настройкам в Blueprint, чтобы проверить, находится ли выбранный \`Input Chord\` среди уже определенных. 2. **Создание события \`On Key Selected\`:** Предполагая, что у вас уже есть событие \`On Key Selected\`, которое возвращает выбранный \`Input Chord\`, нужно добавить логику сравнения этого \`Input Chord\` с существующими настройками. 3. **Сравнение введенной клавиши с существующими Input Mappings:** Создайте переменную для хранения всех существующих \`Input Mappings\`. Получите все существующие настройки управления, используя специальные ноды. Потом используйте цикл (например, \`For Each Loop\`) для перебора всех этих настроек. Сравнение можно выполнить, используя ноду \\"Equal (Input Chord)\\" или сверяя поля входа вручную, такие как \`Key\`, \`bShift\`, \`bCtrl\`, \`bAlt\`, и \`bCmd\`. Если найдено совпадение, то есть введенный \`Input Chord\` уже используется в другом \`Action\` или \`Axis Mapping\`, вы можете тогда выполнить логику показа виджета подтверждения. 4. **Отображение виджета подтверждения:** Если существует совпадение, создайте экземпляр виджета подтверждения, как указано в предыдущем ответе, добавьте его в вьюпорт и установите соответствующую логику для обработки подтверждения пользователем. Вот примерный Blueprint псевдокод для события OnKeySelected: \`\`\` OnKeySelected (Input Chord SelectedKey) GetAll Action Mappings to Array AllActionMappings GetAll Axis Mappings to Array AllAxisMappings For Each Element in AllActionMappings: If SelectedKey == Element.Key: Create Widget \\"Confirm Override\\" > Add to Viewport Break For Each Element in AllAxisMappings: If SelectedKey == Element.Key: Create Widget \\"Confirm Override\\" > Add to Viewport Break \`\`\` **Примечание**: API для программного доступа к Action и Axis Mappings может быть ограничен в Blueprint и может потребовать создания специальных функций на стороне C++. Если доступ невозможен напрямую, вы можете реализовать систему, которая кеширует ваши текущие \`Input Mappings\` и обновляет кеш, когда пользователь изменяет настройки управления. Это общее руководство и вам возможно потребуется адаптировать его, в зависимости от уникальных потребностей вашего проекта и текущей реализации настроек управления."},{"prompt":"Let’s do a roleplay scenario set in a fantasy world before technology where I control Rai, a 17 year old boy who goes on a picnic date with 16 year old Lily. Lily’s the daughter of a nymph, and as such, has mysterious powers that can charm boys and cause them to regress in age. Rai isn’t aware of it, though, and definitely not of the fact many of her previous love interests have ended up back in kindergarten. Can Rai triumph through the date? and if not, just how young will he get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether her charms and regression affect him. Of course, when he gets younger, it's both in mind and body, and Lily will treat him like he’s younger too. Introduce various penalties that carry through the date, and make it so if Rai regresses in age, he becomes even more susceptible to her charms.

Within this town resides Rai, a young man of 17 with a heart full of adventure and eyes brimming with wonder. Rai has agreed to go on a picnic with Lily, a maiden whose beauty is whispered to be as enchanting as the moon's reflection on a still lake. Rai, oblivious to the peculiar heritage of his companion, prepares for the afternoon with nervous excitement. Little does he know that Lily is the offspring of a powerful nymph and that she has inherited a gift that is both wondrous and worrisome. The date is set in a clearing, a serene space where the sunlight dapples through the emerald leaves overhead, and the grass is a tapestry of wildflowers. As Rai approaches the clearing, he spots Lily, who greets him with a smile as mesmerizing as starlight. She's laid out a blanket and prepared a delightful spread of fruits, cheeses, and freshly baked bread. Before the picnic proceeds, Rai must make his first roll to see if he can remain unaffected by Lily's initial charm, which fills the air with a subtle magic. Roll a d20 now to see if Rai can maintain his composure. *Roll for initial charm resistance: Roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, Rai temporarily resists the charm. If you roll 10 or lower, Rai feels the first stirrings of enchantment.*"},{"prompt":"4","completion":"Alas, Rai's heart flutters unexpectedly as he gazes upon Lily. The air itself seems to coalesce around her, carrying a sweet fragrance that muddles his thoughts. He finds himself entranced by her smile, her eyes, the melody of her voice. Lily's charm has begun to weave its spell over him, and Rai feels a warmth in his chest that is not entirely his own. \\"Welcome, Rai,\\" Lily's voice is soft as she invites him to sit beside her on the blanket, \\"I'm so glad you could make it.\\" Rai, feeling younger and more naive under the influence of Lily's charm, struggles to maintain the maturity expected of a 17-year-old. The world seems sharper, more vibrant, and he suddenly feels a bit out of place—as though he's too big for his own clothes. As they begin to eat, Lily asks Rai about his interests and his dreams. She listens intently, nodding and smiling, but as they converse, she interlaces her words with subtle hints of magic, seeking to lower his guard even further. Rai must now roll again to determine whether he can push back against the burgeoning magic that seeks to regress him in age, or if he will slip further under Lily's spell. *Roll for resisting age regression: Roll a d20. On top of being charmed, you will now incur a penalty of -2 to your roll due to the initial charm taking hold. To resist regressing, you need to score a 13 or above, factoring in the penalty.* Please roll the d20 and tell me the result."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"The dice of fate are not in Rai’s favor this day. As he converses with Lily, his words begin to slur slightly, and he notices his thoughts becoming simpler, more childlike. The world around grows larger in his eyes, and his clothes begin to hang loosely on his shrinking frame. Without realizing it, Rai finds himself regressing in both mind and body, becoming younger by the minute under the potent magic of Lily's charm. The shift is subtle at first; Rai's sentences shorten, his topics of conversation shift towards more childish interests, and before long, he's speaking with the cadence and wonder of a much younger boy. Lily watches the transformation with delight, feigning innocence as she interacts with Rai at his new level of maturity. She hands him a piece of fruit, now appearing immense in his smaller hands, and watches as he marvels at its size. \\"You seem full of energy today, Rai!\\" she coos, with a sly smile knowing his true situation. \\"Would you like to play a game after our snack?\\" By this point, little Rai might be around the age of 6, both in body and mind. His ability to discern what's happening to him is greatly diminished by his enchantment and regression. To see if Rai can at least slow down his regression or perhaps even regain some of his lost years, he needs to roll again. Unfortunately, the more he regresses, the harder it will be to resist Lily's powers. *Roll to reverse or slow regression: Roll a d20. You now have a significant penalty of -4 to your roll due to the depth of your regression. Achieving a 15 or higher will indicate some reversal, while anything less means Rai slips further into youth.* Please roll the d20 and tell me the result."},{"prompt":"12","completion":"With the roll being 12, even before applying the -4 penalty for his deepened susceptibility, it is clear Rai is unable to regain his years or slow down the process of regression. With his youthful innocence magnifying under Lily's magical influence, Rai finds himself briskly shrinking, both mentally and physically, now receding to the state of a curious and excitable 4-year-old toddler. The world around him becomes a playground of gigantic proportions. Rai gazes up at Lily, who now seems like a gentle giant; her features soften as she looks down at the young boy who was once nearly her age. \\"Oh, how you've grown down, little Rai,\\" she says with a playful tone, adjusting the way she addresses him to match his new, tender age. \\"You're so cute! Let's play some games, okay?\\" Lily suggests, presenting him with a wooden toy soldier she had prepared, knowing that her powers would likely take effect during their encounter. As a toddler, Rai is overwhelmingly enthralled by the simple toy, and his previous life as a teenager seems like a fuzzy dream. He laughs and claps his little hands, delighted by the attention and the games, now wholly absorbed in the moment. Rai's situation is precarious; unless he can muster some profound resistance to Lily's magic, he may find himself regressing even further. His thoughts are now those of a small child, and it will take a significant effort to remember that he is—or was—something more. *Roll to resist further regression: Roll a d20. The penalty remains at -4. A roll of 16 or higher is now required to resist further regression, and anything less will cause Rai to grow younger still.* Please roll your d20 to see if Rai manages to maintain his tiny toddler form or if he becomes even more diminutive."},{"prompt":"12","completion":"The die cast a shadow on Rai's fate once more, and with the 12 on the roll slipping further to an 8 after applying the -4 penalty, Rai's regression continues apace. The already young toddler begins to change even more noticeably as the afternoon unfolds. Rai's clothing becomes comically oversized as his tiny frame diminishes even further. His speech is now a bubbly array of giggles and simple, half-formed words - the speech of a child just beginning to explore language. He forgets the games of teenagers and the complexities of adolescent conversation, now utterly enthralled by peek-a-boo and the wonders of a butterfly flitting by. Lily, with an almost maternal warmth and a hidden smirk of satisfaction, picks up Rai, now a mere 2-year-old in both mind and body, and sets him on her lap. She speaks to him in gentle, cooing tones, \\"What a precious little boy you are, Rai. Let's have some fun with blocks and flowers, shall we?\\" She presents him with soft, colorful building blocks, and Rai laughs with unbridled joy, his previous life as a 17-year-old all but washed away in the stream of her magical charm. At this rate, Rai may end up needing a crib before the picnic is over. However, there's always a chance, no matter how slim, that the winds of fate could change his course. Rai, now with the mind and body of a toddler, needs to roll to find out if he can stop regressing before it's too late. *Roll to halt regression: Roll a d20. You'll incur a severe penalty of -5 due to the profound level of regression. You need to roll a natural 20 to stop from getting younger.* With everything at stake, roll your d20 to determine Rai's immediate future."},{"prompt":"restart scenario","completion":"**The Picnic of Beginnings** Once more, the stage is set in the whispering woods of Elderglen, where the fabric between the everyday and the enchanted is as thin as gossamer. Rai, a sprightly young man of 17, stands at the cusp of an afternoon that could be filled with wonder or woven with wiles. This time, forewarned by the echoes of fading dreams, Rai feels an unusual prickle of caution as he prepares for his picnic with Lily, the ethereal daughter of a nymph known for her bewitching allure. A part of him—a part that might be dismissed as déjà vu—tells him to be wary, but the memory is like a shadow, difficult to grasp. With a deep breath, Rai steps into the clearing, and there she is: Lily, whose smile is tempting and whose eyes seem to hold secrets deeper than the nearby brook. \\"Hi, Lily,\\" Rai greets her, his voice strong and rooted, like the oaks that surround the sunlit grove. He sits down on the blanket she has spread, filled with delectable food and drinks, the arrangements more charming than he remembers agreeing to. Before they begin, Rai must once again roll the die of fate to see if he can resist the initial waft of charm emanating from Lily's presence and not repeat the past he barely recalls. *Roll for initial charm resistance: Roll a d20.

If you roll 10 or lower, the subtle magic begins its enchanting work.* Please make your roll and tell me the result."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"Once again, Rai feels the strange warmth spreading through his chest as he sits down on the blanket next to Lily. The world seems to shine a little brighter around her, and Rai can't help but be drawn in by her laugh, her graceful movements, and the melodic tone of her voice. Despite the déjà vu that had warned him, Rai's defenses falter as Lily's charm seeps into his very being. His guard drops, and he begins to feel more impressionable, more open to suggestion, and a touch more youthful in spirit. Lily wastes no time and starts to engage Rai in light conversation, her words laced with a subtle magic designed to enchant and enthrall. As they talk and share the delicious food, Rai must now roll to see if he can resist further charms that Lily may weave into their interaction, potentially regressing him in age. *Roll for resisting further charm and regression: Roll a d20.

To successfully resist, you need to score a 13 or higher after applying the penalty.* Please roll your d20 and report the result."},{"prompt":"13","completion":"With the dice rolling to a 13 and applying the -2 penalty, Rai manages to just cling to his current age. The magic woven into Lily's honeyed words seems to shimmer around him, attempting to pull at his being, but he remains steadfast, holding onto his sense of self. Perhaps it is a fleeting memory from his past encounter or an innate willpower that spurs him on, but Rai fights back the regression with every ounce of his youthful vigor. Nonetheless, the charm's influence lingers like a melody that one cannot quite forget, and Rai finds himself deeply engrossed in Lily's presence, more so than he would normally allow. Despite this, Rai's awareness that something is amiss grows stronger. He makes an effort to steer the conversation toward more neutral topics and avoid any enchanting gazes or gestures from Lily. It becomes a delicate dance of words and wills as they continue their picnic. Rai must remain vigilant, for the spell of charm and regression has only been kept at bay and not broken. *Roll to maintain age and presence of mind: Roll a d20.

He begins to speak more cautiously, choosing his words carefully and making sure to keep the conversation on topics less likely to expose him to Lily's whimsical powers. Rai finds himself talking about the scenic beauty of the woods around them and the enchantments that fill its air—safe subjects that keep Lily engaged without leaving too much room for her charms. Lily seems amused by Rai's resolve, a bemused smile adorning her lips as she watches him carefully parry the underlying magic in their exchange. Perhaps she even respects his subtle resistance, or maybe she simply enjoys the challenge. \\"Rai, you seem different today, more... resilient,\\" she observes, her voice laced with a mixture of curiosity and playfulness. Rai, mustering a semblance of confidence, decides to take a more proactive approach, and deliberately redirects their activities towards the physical—suggesting a walk in the woods, hoping that the movement and focus on the natural world would help him resist her magical influence. *Roll to actively resist and diffuse Lily's charm during the walk: Roll a d20. This time, Rai's clever change of tactic grants you a one-time +1 bonus for this roll only, effectively reducing the penalty to -1.

The number that fate delivers is a merciless 1. As they walk through the woods, Rai's surroundings become increasingly wondrous. The trees seem taller, the colors more vibrant, and his sense of scale starts to shift. The forest that was once familiar now feels like a land of giants. His steps become unsteady, his speech simplifies, and a childlike sense of awe overtakes him. Lily watches with a mixture of faux concern and hidden mirth as Rai regresses rapidly in both mind and body. His clothes start to hang loose on his frame, and suddenly the world is too big, too vast, as if he were shrinking with every step he takes. He tries to speak, to ask what's happening, but only manages a confused and concerned babble. \\"Oops, it seems you need a little help, little Rai,\\" Lily says as she effortlessly picks him up, his body now the size of a young child's. \\"Don't worry, we'll take care of you.\\" Rai, with the mind and body of a four-year-old, is fully under Lily's enchanting spell. He looks up at her, eyes wide with confusion and a dawning sense of dependency. With his regression this time, it seems an uphill battle to reclaim his true age. There might still be a chance for Rai to resist further regression and perhaps reverse the process, but it will require an extraordinary effort on his part—or a twist of luck. *Roll to resist further regression: With Rai's severe regression, he incurs a -5 penalty to this roll. He would need a perfect 20 to avoid slipping any further into youth.* Please roll your d20 once more to determine Rai's fate."},{"prompt":"make a js script which detects t he users mouse position","completion":"To detect the mouse position in a webpage using JavaScript, you can use the \`mousemove\` event listener on the \`document\` or a specific element.

Гача-Баннер персонажа \\"Митронил\\" бьёт рекорды по продажам, но гача-баннер персонажа \\"Аякши Роки\\" провалился так как английская актриса озвучки этого персонажа оказалась втянута в скандал (она сказала в интервью, что Гитлер уничтожал не только евреев, но и другие народы. Теперь её обвиняют в антисемитизме и требуют извинений, но она отказывается. Общественность подняла скандал). 2. Кто-то из команды разработчиков в втихаря увеличил груди моделям роботов в новом обновлении игры. Теперь эти роботы очень популярны в сети как мем, но студию обвиняют в сексизме. 3. Русскоязычные гроки недовольны, что в новой главе игры нет русской локализации. Локализация не была сделана так как наш издатель FreeZomb не выделяет на это деньги и не даёт деньги, так как FreeZomb решил уйти из Российского и белорусского рынка из-за политических соображений. А наша игра имеет при этом большую фан-базу в странах СНГ. 4. Один из наших ведущих сценаристов Джек Китори, создавший весь основной лор игры, в своих личных соцсетях высказывается о своей поддержке Путина, а также недавно он посетил Крым (который он назвал российской территорией). Наш издатель FreeZomb требует его увольнения или официальных изменений от него. Но он не станет извиняться по своему характеру. 5. Игроки жалуются, что мы вводим в игру слишком много мужских персонажей. На данный момент в игре 70% женских персонажей и 30% мужских. 6. Украинские игроки просят удалить из игры фракцию \\"Сыны единства\\", которая по дизайну напоминает советский союз.","completion":"Директор: Доброе утро, коллеги. Прежде всего, я хочу поздравить всех с успехом гача-баннера персонажа \\"Митронил\\". Однако, сегодня у нас есть несколько важных вопросов, требующих нашего немедленного внимания. Давайте начнем обсуждение. Менеджер по маркетингу: Так, первой на повестке наш скандал с озвучкой персонажа \\"Аякши Роки\\". Мы видим, что продажи баннера резко упали после скандальных высказываний озвучивающей актрисы. Публика требует, чтобы мы взяли меры. Какой у нас будет план? PR-менеджер: Считаю, что мы должны срочно выделить заявление, в котором подчеркнуть, что мнение актрисы не отражает позицию нашей компании. После этого предложим бесплатный заменительный персонаж игрокам, как извинение за неприятности. Менеджер по продукту: Хорошая идея, PR-менеджер. Теперь перейдем ко второму вопросу: ситуация с изменением моделей роботов. Это вызвало большой шум в сообществе. Креативный директор: Мы точно не можем оставить всё как есть. Репутационный ущерб может быть значительным. Давайте устроим внутреннее расследование и публично признаем ошибку, обещая фикс в ближайшем патче. IT-менеджер: Понял, проведем расследование. А что насчет русскоязычных игроков и локализации? Международный менеджер: Это сложная ситуация. FreeZomb не поддерживает финансирование, но мы не можем игнорировать нашу фан-базу. Думаю, мы должны поискать альтернативные пути финансирования или попробовать собрать средства через краудфандинг непосредственно от сообщества. Финансовый директор: Поддерживаю. Инициируем краудфандинг, чтобы не потерять нашу аудиторию в СНГ. Далее, есть проблема со сценаристом Джеком Китори... Юридический консультант: Это трудное положение. Мы должны внимательно взвесить риски для нашего имиджа. Возможно, стоит договориться с Джеком о нейтральной позиции в социальных сетях, чтобы не ухудшать отношения с нашим издателем. Кадровый менеджер: Я поговорю с ним, но если Китори откажется сотрудничать, нам придется принять более решительные меры, вплоть до разрыва контракта. Директор: Поднимаем следующий вопрос. Игроки жалуются на то, что у нас слишком много мужских персонажей в игре. Как мы будем реагировать на это? Менеджер по выбору контента: Это недоразумение. В игре действительно больше женских персонажей. Мы уже планировали пару женских персонажей для будущих обновлений, так что давайте ускорим их выпуск и подчеркнем это в нашем маркетинге. Директор: Отлично. И последний пункт: удаление фракции \\"Сыны единства\\" по требованию украинских игроков. Менеджер по разработке: Попробуем найти компромиссное решение, возможно, изменив некоторые визуальные элементы фракции, чтобы они меньше напоминали советский союз.

Сообщество всё равно выступает против актрисы озвучки и требует удаления персонажа. 2. Фикс роботов вызвал скандал, игроки считают новую внешность роботов новым лицом игры, а разработчики у них это забирают. 3.

Спасибо за ваши усилия на прошлом заседании, но перед нами стоят новые проблемы и нам необходимо найди ответы на срочные вопросы. Давайте начнем с первого пункта. Менеджер по маркетингу, каковы новости относительно актрисы озвучки и персонажа \\"Аякши Роки\\"? Менеджер по маркетингу: Ситуация осложняется, сообщество все же требует удаления персонажа. Давайте рассмотрим возможность замены голоса актрисы и перепродажи персонажа с новой озвучкой, это может успокоить геминговую аудиторию. PR-менеджер: Я согласен. При этом мы проведем благотворительную акцию, чтобы показать нашу обеспокоенность проблемами антисемитизма. Директор: Отличная инициатива. Что насчет роботов? Технический директор: После обновления игроки действительно стали идентифицировать новые модели с игрой. Возможно, нам необходимо найти более сбалансированный вариант, который удовлетворит и игроков, и критиков. Креативный директор: Мы можем устроить голосование в сообществе, чтобы узнать мнение большинства игроков, и исходя из этого принимать решение. Директор: Прекрасно, давайте это сделаем. А теперь перейдем к проблеме с локализацией. Международный менеджер: Похоже, что сообщество в России хочет помочь с переводом. Быть может мы могли бы использовать их помощь вопреки желаниям FreeZomb, особенно если это может быть сделано открыто и прозрачно, чтобы избежать обвинений в закулисной игре. Финансовый директор: Мы обязательно должны рассмотреть этот вариант и возможно искать альтернативные пути сотрудничества для поддержки наших русскоязычных игроков. Директор: Хорошо. Давайте обдумаем эту стратегию. Теперь о Джеке Китори. Кадровый менеджер: Джек сказал, что его персональное мнение в социальных сетях отделено от его работы. Мы не хотим терять ценного сценариста.

Это позволит вам использовать выбранное значение для сравнения. 2. **Сравнение input chords**: Для сравнения input chord, которую выбрал пользователь, с уже существующим списком назначений ключей, вам будет необходимо перебрать этот список и сравнить каждый элемент с вашей сохраненной переменной. Список может быть хранится, например, в массиве или может быть получен из настроек управления (Input Settings). 3. **Показать виджет при совпадении**: Если вы обнаружили совпадение через сравнение, вам необходимо вызвать логику создания и показа виджета, который сообщит пользователю о совпадении. Давайте рассмотрим пример реализации: Допустим, у вас есть список \`ExistingKeyBindings\`, содержащий уже используемые \`Input Chord\`: \`\`\`cpp // Example TArray of existing key bindings TArray<FInputChord> ExistingKeyBindings; \`\`\` Используйте функцию для сравнения \`Input Chord\`: \`\`\`cpp bool IsKeyBindExists(const FInputChord& NewKeyBind) { for (const FInputChord& ExistingBind : ExistingKeyBindings) { if (ExistingBind.Key == NewKeyBind.Key && ExistingBind.bShift == NewKeyBind.bShift && ExistingBind.bCtrl == NewKeyBind.bCtrl && ExistingBind.bAlt == NewKeyBind.bAlt && ExistingBind.bCmd == NewKeyBind.bCmd) { // Input Chords are the same return true; } } return false; } \`\`\` В вашем Blueprint или C++ коде, после получения нового Input Chord, вызовите функцию сравнения: \`\`\`cpp FInputChord UserSelectedChord; // Переменная, в которую будет сохранен выбранный Input Chord. if (IsKeyBindExists(UserSelectedChord)) { // Key binding exists, show your widget or notification to the user. // Здесь идет логика для показа виджета. } \`\`\` Для того чтобы показать виджет, вы можете использовать функцию \`Create Widget\`, а затем \`Add to Viewport\` (для добавления виджета на экран). Помните, что это лишь пример, который иллюстрирует общую идею. В реальной разработке игры вы возможно будете использовать систему ключей управления (Action и Axis mappings), доступные в настройках инпута проекта (Project Settings -> Input). Вам также потребуется добавить логику по обработке коллизий ключевых привязок, чтобы пользователи не могли назначить одну и ту же кнопку на разные действия."},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical, where are some locations for London's 4th Airport?","completion":"When discussing a hypothetical scenario for a new (fourth) major airport serving London, we must consider factors such as ease of access, minimization of environmental and community impacts, and potential for economic growth. The existing major airports serving London are Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted. Luton is also sometimes included in the list, though it is smaller than the others. Any new airport would need to complement these existing hubs and be situated in a location that could support significant passenger and cargo traffic. Here are some hypothetical locations that could be considered for London's fourth major airport: 1. Thames Estuary (Boris Island): This was a significant proposal known as the Thames Estuary Airport, which received considerable attention, especially from the then-Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The idea was to build an airport on an artificial island in the Thames Estuary to the east of London, which would minimize noise pollution over densely populated areas and have room for expansion. 2. North Kent Coast: Building it on the North Kent Coast, close to the Thames Estuary, would have similar benefits to the 'Boris Island' concept, away from major population centers. 3. Oxfordshire or Buckinghamshire: A location to the northwest of London could provide a good complement to the existing airports, as most are situated to the south and east of London. It would also be relatively close to the UK's 'Motorway Box' of the M25, M4, M40, and M1 for good road connectivity. 4. Severn Estuary: Although quite far to the west, a new airport here could serve both London and regions in the South West. The challenge would be creating a sufficiently rapid transport link to make it a viable option for London travelers. 5. Expansion of an Existing Minor Airport: Instead of building a completely new airport, an existing smaller airport could be expanded. Locations like Southend, Manston, or even RAF bases like Brize Norton (with significant investment and development) could be potential candidates. 6. Inner Thames Estuary: An alternative to 'Boris Island,' building in the inner estuary closer to London could reduce costs and potentially improve transport links, though it might raise environmental concerns. In each case, one would need to consider a vast array of factors, such as proximity to residential areas to mitigate noise pollution, environmental impact on local ecosystems, connectivity to London via road and rail, and airspace congestion. There would also be significant policy, planning, and financial hurdles to overcome before such a project could be realized. The importance of careful consultation with local communities and stakeholders and a detailed environmental impact assessment cannot be overstated."},{"prompt":"Write a fake news report where a man is jailed for being in possession of the Death Cable, which is a male to male extension cord, which is super dangerous","completion":"[Disclaimer: The following content is a fictional news report created for entertainment purposes only.] News Flash! Man Jailed for Possession of the \\"Death Cable\\": A Male to Male Extension Cord Menace In a bizarre turn of events, a man in suburban Smithfield was arrested and sentenced to jail today after law enforcement discovered he was in possession of a so-called \\"Death Cable,\\" an illegal and exceptionally hazardous male-to-male extension cord. The \\"Death Cable,\\" as it has been dubbed by the authorities, is a non-standard power cord that, against all electrical codes, features prongs at both ends. Electrical safety experts have condemned these cables because they pose a significant electrocution and fire risk, creating a direct short circuit when plugged into two outlets. The Smithfield man, John Doe, 38, was apprehended during a routine inspection by the city’s highly specialized Electrical Safety Task Force (ESTF), which had been conducting a crackdown on illegal wiring in the area. \\"We received a tip that someone was using a homemade electrical device in the neighborhood,\\" said Chief Inspector Alan Sparks. “During our search, we found Mr. Doe with the infamous 'Death Cable.' This contraption is a disaster waiting to happen. He's lucky we caught it early, or we might have been looking at a major tragedy.\\" The police report indicated that Doe had been using the hazardous cable to power his extensive collection of outdoor lights without proper outdoor-rated extension cords. When confronted, Doe was under the impression that the cable was a time-saving hack, unaware of the device's notoriety and potentially lethal consequences. Following his arrest, Doe was charged with reckless endangerment and violation of city electrical codes. The presiding judge handed down a sentence of 60 days in jail, along with a stern warning about the perils of such DIY electrical work. \\"This should serve as a serious warning to anyone trying to cut corners when it comes to electrical safety,\\" stated Judge Gerald Wattson. \\"Our community's welfare is at stake, and this so-called 'Death Cable' is nothing to take lightly.\\" In the wake of this conviction, the ESTF has issued a public service announcement urging residents to report any suspicious electrical devices and to seek professional help for any home electrical projects. The residents of Smithfield can sleep a little safer tonight, knowing that the \\"Death Cable\\" has been unplugged and its purveyor behind bars. This incident serves as a grim reminder of the lengths some will go to bypassing basic safety regulations, only to find themselves caught in a tangle of legal and potentially deadly repercussions."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where it is also known as a Suicide Cord due to it's dangers, the man found responsible for making it will serve life","completion":"[Disclaimer: The following content is a fictional news report created for entertainment purposes only.] Breaking News Update: Creator of the \\"Death Cable\\" Sentenced to Life in Prison The saga of the infamous \\"Death Cable\\" took a dramatic twist today as the mastermind behind its creation was sentenced to life imprisonment. The cable, more ominously referred to as the \\"Suicide Cord\\" due to its extreme dangers, has been linked to a string of electrical incidents across the country. In a tense courtroom filled with concerned citizens and media, James Wireman, 47, was found guilty on multiple counts of endangerment to human life, criminal negligence, and the manufacture of illegal and hazardous materials. Wireman, now known as the \\"Suicide Cord Kingpin,\\" was discovered to be the architect of a widespread production operation of these deadly male-to-male extension cords. During the trial, evidence presented by the prosecution painted Wireman as a reckless profiteer, who dismissed countless safety warnings and bypassed regulations to push his hazardous contraptions onto the market. Leveraging online forums and dark web marketplaces, Wireman managed to distribute thousands of these \\"Suicide Cords,\\" with no regard for the potential loss of life. Tragedy had already struck in several instances linked to the usage of the \\"Death Cable,\\" including house fires and several near-fatal electrocutions. It was the untimely death of a young electrician, however, that brought Wireman's activities into the judiciary's crosshairs. The electrician, who had been hired to inspect a home's wiring, accidentally came into contact with an active \\"Suicide Cord\\" hidden under a pile of leaves in the backyard, resulting in his immediate and tragic demise. The victim's family members were present in the courtroom, giving emotional testimony about the loss they suffered and the reckless negligence of Wireman's actions. \\"Your honor, Wireman's cables are weapons, plain and simple,\\" the prosecuting attorney argued. \\"He knew the risks and consequences, yet chose profit over human lives. The blood of the innocent is on his hands.\\" In delivering the sentence, Judge Capacitor made it clear that the severity of the punishment was intended to reflect the gravity of the crime and serve as a deterrent to anyone who might consider following in Wireman's footsteps. \\"James Wireman, the evidence against you is irrefutable,\\" said Judge Capacitor solemnly. \\"Your blatant disregard for safety and human life is appalling. This court sentences you to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\\" As Wireman was led away, the courtroom erupted in a mix of applause and tears. Outside the courthouse, the Electrical Safety Task Force issued a statement, reiterating their commitment to removing all \\"Suicide Cords\\" from circulation and reminding the public of the ongoing amnesty program for turning in any such devices, no questions asked. With Wireman's conviction, authorities hope that the dark chapter of the \\"Death Cable\\" is finally closed. Still, they warn the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious electrical items to the authorities so that future tragedies may be averted."},{"prompt":"Let’s do a roleplay scenario set in a fantasy world before technology where I control Rai, a 17 year old boy who goes on a picnic date with 16 year old Lily.

I'm so glad you could make it. Everything looks so beautiful today, doesn't it?\\" she says softly, her voice almost melodic. Without a doubt, the aura of the location and the charm of Lily's presence are potent. However, unknown to Rai, the very air is laced with the faint essence of nymph magic—a subtle enchantment woven by Lily, not with malice but as an unconscious manifestation of her heritage. As Rai sets the basket down and makes himself comfortable on the blanket, he catches Lily's gaze. Her eyes seem to shimmer for a moment, an involuntary flicker of her powers testing Rai's defenses.

He feels strangely more relaxed and at ease, though a part of him—a rational whisper—warns him to be cautious. Lily smiles again, her eyes sparkling with an innocent delight that belies the complexity of her powers. \\"I thought we could start with some sandwiches I made. I hope you like them,\\" she says as she hands Rai a delicately prepared sandwich. The meal progresses with light conversation, laughter, and shared stories. However, as they talk, Lily recounts a whimsical tale of her childhood in the forest, filled with magical creatures and enchantments. Her narrative weaves a captivating spell, potentially drawing Rai further into her world.

A subtle energy swirls around Rai, and though he doesn't notice it, his limbs feel lighter, his thoughts simpler. He begins to giggle at parts of the story that wouldn't have amused him before, his behavior starting to reflect that of a younger version of himself. At this point, Lily observes Rai with a subtle, knowing look. She doesn't intend to harm, but part of her revels in the sight of someone being so affected by her presence. However, she might still think Rai is simply being agreeable or is just good with kids, unaware of his actual age regression. Rai doesn't fully understand the shift within himself. Yet, as the firm grasp on his mature self weakens, he needs to test his will. Roll a d20 once more to see how significantly Rai regresses in age.

There is regression, but it's a delicate balance, and Rai ages down only by a couple of years in both mind and body. As the picnic continues, Rai, now appearing and feeling closer to 15, is less self-conscious and a bit more carefree. He laughs a little louder, runs his hands through the grass without reservation, and he might even swing a leg or two without realizing that it's not quite how he'd usually comport himself. Lily watches him with a mixture of fondness and curiosity. \\"You really enjoy my stories, don't you?\\" she gently teases, taking delight in his light-heartedness without recognizing the underlying cause. Still, a latent awareness within Rai questions the slight haziness in his thoughts. It's like looking back through a fogged mirror, seeing glimpses of his former maturity but unable to fully grasp it. It's now that the real test comes; Lily decides to suggest a game of hide and seek in the nearby woods, a nostalgic game that might stir deeper magic and cause greater regression depending on Rai's susceptibility.

As he dashes off to find a hiding spot, each step seems to carry him further away from his true age. Laughter bubbles up from his chest—a childlike sound filled only with the moment's joy and thrill. He finds a spot behind a thick-trunked tree, crouching low, his breaths coming out in excited pants. Yet, as he waits for Lily to find him, a sense of confusion laces through his excitement. There's the faint itch of a memory that he's meant to be older, more composed, but the thought is like trying to catch smoke with his bare hands—it eludes his grasp. Lily calls out playfully, \\"Ready or not, here I come!\\" Her voice seems to echo through the woods, weaving among the trees with a lyrical enchantment. She seeks out Rai with a smile, knowing yet unwittingly amplifying the effect of her innate magic. Rai, now influenced by magic and the nature of the game, regresses another couple of years. He appears and behaves closer to a youthful 13-year-old, his recent past becoming hazier in his mind. Rai's next interaction with Lily will be critical, as her reactions to his youthful demeanor could either stabilize his current state or trigger a deeper regression into childhood, should her enchantment continue to seep into his being.

As she approaches, her laughter rings through the air, the enchantment around them seemingly sparkling with her joy. However, Rai's heart holds firm; the fun of the game has reinforced the joyful parts of his younger self, yet his core—his true sense of self—stands resilient against the pull of regression. When Lily finds him, there's an evident lightness in her eyes, a playful scold in her voice, \\"Found you, Rai! You're quite good at this. You're so full of surprises!\\" she says with genuine affection. Rai stands up from his hiding spot, brushing leaves from his clothes with a grin. The spark of youth in his eyes is bright, but there's also a clarity there, a window back to the Rai that walked to the picnic—an almost 17-year-old buried within the guise of a 13-year-old boy. Lily notices the slight changes in Rai, the subtle shifts in his behavior and physical appearance, but she waves them off as the results of good fun and perhaps a growth spurt happening in reverse. Still, deeper inside, there's a niggling concern she can't quite quell. After all, she's seen the full extent of the magic's effect before, even if she hasn't fully understood it.

As they return to the picnic blanket, Lily presents the dessert with a flourish—it's a batch of small, delectable-looking cupcakes with frosting as whimsical as a fairy tale. \\"These are my special cupcakes,\\" Lily says with a smile. \\"My mother taught me how to make them, and they always seem to bring a smile to everyone's face. Go on, pick one!\\" Rai reaches out and takes a cupcake, admiring the delicate sparkle of the frosting—unaware that it's made with a hint of nymph magic. He takes a bite, and the flavors are extraordinary, each one unfolding like a petal in bloom. It's enchantment in edible form, and with each mouthful, Rai feels a renewed wave of youthfulness wash over him. A warmth spreads from his belly to the tips of his fingers, as if the simple act of enjoying dessert were pulling threads of his maturity away, weaving them back into the tapestry of childhood. The world around Rai grows slightly larger, his clothes becoming a tad looser, and his perception subtly shifts. Laughter comes easier, and worries seem to float away like dandelion seeds on a breeze. By the time the cupcake is gone, Rai's regression has become more pronounced, bringing his apparent age down to about 11 years, though he's still holding onto fragments of his older self. Lily observes Rai's boyish glee and begins to wonder if something might be amiss—her mother's warnings about her abilities echo in the back of her mind, and she takes a mental note to be more cautious in how she interacts with Rai. However, the date is not yet over. How Lily addresses this peculiar shift in Rai's demeanor will be crucial. Can she help anchor him to his true age, or will her innate magic inadvertently coax him backward into childhood?

This innocent gesture, combined with the strong enchantment that lingers from the cupcakes, acts as a catalyst. It allows Lily's latent powers to surge forth with unexpected intensity, channeling into Rai through the simple contact of their hands. Lily feels the surge of magic and is momentarily startled by the intense connection. Her eyes widen as she watches Rai, concern flickering across her face. Rai's actions, though meant to be playful and endearing, take on an almost childlike quality. His giggle, high-pitched and carefree, fills the air, and his eyes glaze over with a youthful innocence that wasn't there before. With this critical roll, Rai's regression is drastic. His body and mind transform swiftly and visibly. The clothes on his body hang loose and oversized now, his features soften, and his stature shrinks. When he next speaks, his voice is that of a much younger boy—Rai has regressed to the age of 6 in mind and body. Lily, realizing what's happening, pulls her hand away gently. She's finally conscious of the magnitude of her powers and their effect on Rai. \\"Oh my,\\" she whispers, her voice a blend of wonder and worry. She quickly switches to a nurturing tone, addressing Rai as one would a young child. \\"Did you enjoy the cupcake, Rai?\\" she asks, hoping to keep the situation calm and trying to figure out how to possibly reverse the unintentional enchantment. Now, Rai, unaware of the drastic change, simply continues to enjoy the remnants of the picnic, looking up at Lily with a trusting and innocent gaze, seeking approval and friendship from someone he now sees as a much older companion. We'll hold off on further dice rolls at this moment. Rai's current state as a young child is a critical juncture for Lily to decide whether she will reveal the truth about her abilities and seek a way to restore him, or if Rai will remain blissfully unaware of his true age as they conclude what has turned into a most unusual picnic date."},{"prompt":"I take off my baggy clothes and ask Lily if she wants to swim with me at the lake","completion":"Lily watches with a mix of concern and maternal instinct as Rai, in his new six-year-old form, discards the clothes that have become much too large for his small frame.

Lily knows that allowing Rai to swim might distract him and give her time to think, but she's also aware of the safety concerns—Rai might be a 17-year-old in mind, but right now, he has the body and likely the swimming ability of a 6-year-old. She quickly gathers up Rai's oversized clothing and rummages through the picnic basket, pulling out a light blanket. With careful hands, she wraps it around Rai's small frame to fashion an impromptu garment to keep him modest and warm. \\"First, let's wrap you up in this, so you don't catch a cold,\\" she says, trying to infuse her voice with cheerfulness. \\"And then, how about we play a different game? We can pretend we're adventurers on a quest to seek out magical treasures around the lake!

Remember that the velocity calculation here is very sensitive to the timing of the \`mousemove\` events and may fluctuate; a real-world application might use some form of smoothing or average over multiple samples to provide a more consistent value."},{"prompt":"how can i make them be one seperate lines?","completion":"To display the mouse position and velocity on separate lines, you can simply modify the \`textContent\` of the \`mousePositionDiv\` to include a line break \`n\`. However, since line breaks are not recognized in the plain text content of an HTML div element, you'll want to use \`innerHTML\` and insert a \`<br>\` tag to create a line break in HTML. Here's how you can do it: \`\`\`javascript function updateMousePosition(event) { const mouseX = event.pageX; const mouseY = event.pageY; const currentTimestamp = performance.now(); const { vx, vy } = calculateVelocity(mouseX, mouseY, currentTimestamp); const mousePositionDiv = document.getElementById('mousePosition'); mousePositionDiv.innerHTML = \`Mouse position: X={mouseX}, Y={mouseY}<br>Velocity: X={vx.toFixed(2)}px/s, Y={vy.toFixed(2)}px/s\`; } \`\`\` Be sure to replace any other instances of \`textContent\` with \`innerHTML\` if you want the line break to work in those places as well. This will ensure that the position and velocity are displayed on separate lines within the HTML div element. Keep in mind that when using \`innerHTML\`, you should be careful not to insert user input directly into the page content without proper sanitization to prevent security risks such as XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks. In this particular instance, because the input is numerical data derived from the \`event.pageX\` and \`event.pageY\`, there's no such risk involved."},{"prompt":"I'd like to graph this data with highcharts.","completion":"To graph the mouse velocity data with Highcharts, you will need to integrate Highcharts into your page and then push the velocity data points to the chart series in real-time as you calculate them. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Include Highcharts in your HTML, either by downloading and referencing the Highcharts files locally or including them from a CDN: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script src=\\"https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js\\"><\/script> </head> <body> <!-- Your content here --> <div id=\\"container\\" style=\\"width:100%; height:400px;\\"></div> <!-- You will add your scripts here --> </body> </html> \`\`\` 2. Create a Highcharts chart instance with initial options that fit your requirements: \`\`\`javascript // This is what the Highcharts chart options could look like const chart = Highcharts.chart('container', { chart: { type: 'line', animation: false, // Disable animation for better performance }, title: { text: 'Mouse Velocity', }, xAxis: { type: 'datetime', title: { text: 'Time', }, }, yAxis: { title: { text: 'Velocity (px/s)', }, }, series: [{ name: 'Velocity X', data: [] }, { name: 'Velocity Y', data: [] }], }); // Add this at the end after initDataDiv(), may need adjustments based on your code structure \`\`\` 3. Modify the \`updateMousePosition\` function to add points to the Highcharts series: \`\`\`javascript function updateMousePosition(event) { const mouseX = event.pageX; const mouseY = event.pageY; const currentTimestamp = performance.now(); const { vx, vy } = calculateVelocity(mouseX, mouseY, currentTimestamp); // Update the text element const mousePositionDiv = document.getElementById('mousePosition'); mousePositionDiv.innerHTML = \`Mouse position: X={mouseX}, Y={mouseY}<br>Velocity: X={vx.toFixed(2)}px/s, Y={vy.toFixed(2)}px/s\`; // Add points to Highcharts series chart.series[0].addPoint([currentTimestamp, vx], true, false); chart.series[1].addPoint([currentTimestamp, vy], true, false); } \`\`\` 4. Initialize Highcharts and make sure the above scripts are loaded correctly. 5. Use the existing \`initDataDiv\` function to ensure that everything is set up once the DOM is loaded. The \`addPoint\` function in the code above adds a new point to the X and Y velocity series on the chart. The three parameters are as follows: - \`currentTimestamp\`: The x-value of the point (time in milliseconds). - \`vx\` or \`vy\`: The y-value of the point (velocity in pixels per second). - \`true\`: Specifies whether the chart should redraw after the point is added. - \`false\`: Specifies whether to shift points off the start of the series when adding new points (used for handling a series that grows indefinitely; \`false\` means it won't remove the older points). Make sure to adapt this to your exact requirements and the way your web page is structured. Highcharts offers many options to tailor the chart to your needs, so check the [Highcharts documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) for more details. Keep in mind that plotting data in real-time can be performance-intensive, so you may want to throttle the rate at which data is added to the chart or use decimation techniques to maintain smooth performance."},{"prompt":"how do i add a max lenght so it starts removing data if it exeeds it","completion":"If you want your Highcharts series to maintain only a maximum number of points and start removing old data once that limit is exceeded, you can use the \`shift\` argument of the \`addPoint()\` method. When set to \`true\`, the \`shift\` argument will remove the first point of the series when a new point is added if the series is longer than the defined \`series.data.length\`. First, you'll want to define a maximum length for your data series. For example: \`\`\`javascript const MAX_POINTS = 100; \`\`\` Then, modify your \`updateMousePosition\` function to use the \`shift\` argument based on the current length of the data series: \`\`\`javascript function updateMousePosition(event) { const mouseX = event.pageX; const mouseY = event.pageY; const currentTimestamp = performance.now(); const { vx, vy } = calculateVelocity(mouseX, mouseY, currentTimestamp); // Update the text element const mousePositionDiv = document.getElementById('mousePosition'); mousePositionDiv.innerHTML = \`Mouse position: X={mouseX}, Y={mouseY}<br>Velocity: X={vx.toFixed(2)}px/s, Y={vy.toFixed(2)}px/s\`; // Determine if we should shift points const shiftX = chart.series[0].data.length >= MAX_POINTS; // Will be true if the number of points is >= MAX_POINTS const shiftY = chart.series[1].data.length >= MAX_POINTS; // Add points to Highcharts series chart.series[0].addPoint([currentTimestamp, vx], true, shiftX); chart.series[1].addPoint([currentTimestamp, vy], true, shiftY); } \`\`\` Now, each time a new point is added to one of the series, \`addPoint\` will check if the series length has reached the \`MAX_POINTS\` threshold. If it has, the oldest point (the first point in the series' array) will be removed as the new one is added, ensuring that each series never exceeds the maximum specified length. This way, the chart will only display the most recent \`MAX_POINTS\` number of data points for each velocity series, which can help keep the chart manageable and performant.

Let's illustrate this with the updated \`calculateVelocity\` function and a new \`calculateAverageVelocity\` function. First, define the maximum number of data points over which you'd like to compute the average and initialize arrays to store these points: \`\`\`javascript const AVERAGE_POINTS = 10; // Set this to X, the number of points you want to average over let velocitiesX = []; let velocitiesY = []; \`\`\` Next, let's define a function to calculate the average velocity: \`\`\`javascript function calculateAverageVelocity(velocities) { if (velocities.length === 0) { return 0; } const sum = velocities.reduce((accumulator, velocity) => accumulator + velocity, 0); return sum / velocities.length; } \`\`\` Now, amend the \`updateMousePosition\` function to use these arrays and calculate the average velocity: \`\`\`javascript function updateMousePosition(event) { const mouseX = event.pageX; const mouseY = event.pageY; const currentTimestamp = performance.now(); const { vx, vy } = calculateVelocity(mouseX, mouseY, currentTimestamp); // Add the new velocities to our tracking arrays velocitiesX.push(vx); velocitiesY.push(vy); // If we've accumulated more than AVERAGE_POINTS, remove the oldest one (first in the array) if (velocitiesX.length > AVERAGE_POINTS) velocitiesX.shift(); if (velocitiesY.length > AVERAGE_POINTS) velocitiesY.shift(); // Calculate the average velocities const avgVx = calculateAverageVelocity(velocitiesX); const avgVy = calculateAverageVelocity(velocitiesY); // Update the text element with average velocity const mousePositionDiv = document.getElementById('mousePosition'); mousePositionDiv.innerHTML = \`Mouse position: X={mouseX}, Y={mouseY}<br>Average Velocity: X={avgVx.toFixed(2)}px/s, Y={avgVy.toFixed(2)}px/s\`; // Include chart updating logic as before with the AVERAGE velocity values instead of the instantaneous ones const shiftX = chart.series[0].data.length >= MAX_POINTS; const shiftY = chart.series[1].data.length >= MAX_POINTS; chart.series[0].addPoint([currentTimestamp, avgVx], true, shiftX); chart.series[1].addPoint([currentTimestamp, avgVy], true, shiftY); } \`\`\` In this updated version, the \`velocitiesX\` and \`velocitiesY\` arrays track the last \`AVERAGE_POINTS\` worth of velocity data for the \`x\` and \`y\` directions, respectively.

If the arrays have grown larger than \`AVERAGE_POINTS\`, the oldest data point is removed before adding the new one. By using these averages when updating the chart, you're smoothing out the data over the set number of points, which can result in a less noisy visual representation of the velocity over time. Please note that to make these additions work, you'll need to ensure that the rest of your Highcharts and initialization logic is in place, as previously described. Also, make sure that the \`MAX_POINTS\` constant is configured with the desired maximum number of points to display on the chart before older points get shifted out."},{"prompt":"Diseñame un entrenamiento calistenico para ser el mejor en vale tudo","completion":"Para sobresalir en Vale Tudo, un deporte de combate que permite una amplia variedad de técnicas y es similar al MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), necesitas centrarte en mejorar tu fuerza, agilidad, resistencia, flexibilidad y técnica de combate.

Aquí tienes algunas opciones para reemplazar las dominadas en tu rutina de entrenamiento calisténico: **1. Ejercicios de Remo Inclinado (Australian Pull-ups)** Coloca una barra a una altura donde puedas colgarte de ella con los brazos estirados mientras tus pies están apoyados en el suelo, manteniendo el cuerpo recto. Tira de tu pecho hacia la barra utilizando tus músculos de la espalda y brazos, luego baja lentamente. **2. Pull-ups Negativas** Sube a la barra de dominadas con la ayuda de un salto o una elevación y baja lentamente en un movimiento controlado. Este ejercicio se centra en la fase excéntrica de la dominada, lo que ayuda a construir fuerza. **3. Band Assisted Pull-ups** Usa una banda de resistencia atada a la barra de dominadas para ayudar a soportar parte de tu peso. A medida que adquieras más fuerza, puedes usar bandas de menor ayuda hasta que no las necesites. **4. Remo con Barra (Bent-over Rows)** Si tienes acceso a una barra y pesas, realiza remos inclinados para fortalecer los músculos de la espalda. Mantén la espalda recta y tira de la barra hacia tu abdomen. **5. Remo con Mancuernas** Similar al remo con barra, pero utilizando mancuernas puedes trabajar un brazo a la vez, lo que puede ayudar a equilibrar las fuerzas entre tus lados derecho e izquierdo. **6. Scapular Pulls** Colgándote de la barra de dominadas, mantén los brazos rectos y trata de encoger y bajar tus hombros. Este movimiento fortalece los músculos que utilizas al iniciar una dominada. **7. Remos con Bandas de Resistencia** Si no tienes acceso a pesas, puedes utilizar bandas de resistencia para simular el movimiento de remo, ajustando la tensión para hacer el ejercicio más o menos desafiante. Es importante comenzar con ejercicios que se adapten a tu nivel actual de fuerza y trabajar de manera consistente para mejorar. Con el tiempo y la práctica, aumentarás tu fuerza y finalmente podrás hacer dominadas por ti mismo. Recuerda siempre calentar adecuadamente antes de comenzar tu entrenamiento y escuchar a tu cuerpo para evitar posibles lesiones. Si es posible, consulta con un entrenador certificado para que te asesore y asegúrate de que estás haciendo los ejercicios correctamente."},{"prompt":"Ya, pero no quiero meter en mi entrenamiento ningún progresión de dominadas, ni dominadas. Dime otro ejercicio","completion":"Entendido, si deseas omitir completamente las dominadas y sus variantes de tu rutina de ejercicios calisténicos, aún puedes trabajar tu espalda y mejorar tu fuerza utilizando otros movimientos. Aquí te presento una alternativa que puedes incluir en tu entrenamiento: **Ejercicio Sustitutivo: Supermans** El ejercicio de \\"Superman\\" es un movimiento eficaz para fortalecer los músculos de la espalda sin necesidad de hacer dominadas ni ejercicios similares. **Cómo realizar Supermans:** 1. Acuéstate boca abajo en una colchoneta o en el suelo. 2. Extiende tus brazos hacia delante, con las palmas hacia abajo, y tus piernas rectas hacia atrás. 3. Al mismo tiempo, levanta tus brazos y piernas del suelo aproximadamente de 15 a 20 centímetros, o hasta donde te sea cómodo. 4. Mantén la posición por unos segundos, asegurándote de apretar tus glúteos y los músculos de la espalda baja. 5. Baja con cuidado tus brazos y piernas al suelo y descansa brevemente antes de la próxima repetición. 6. Realiza de 3 a 4 series de 10 a 15 repeticiones, dependiendo de tu nivel de comodidad y fuerza. Este ejercicio no solo trabaja los músculos de la espalda, sino que también fortalece el core, los glúteos y las piernas, lo que es beneficioso para el desempeño en Vale Tudo al ofrecer un soporte corporal más sólido y mejorar la capacidad de ejecutar movimientos explosivos. Recuerda que la variedad en el entrenamiento ayuda a evitar adaptaciones y estancamiento, por lo que puedes beneficiarte de incluir otros ejercicios para espalda que no impliquen el movimiento de tracción vertical como las dominadas. Aquí tienen algunos ejercicios adicionales para fortalecer la espalda: - **Bird-Dog**: Refuerza la espalda y mejora la estabilidad del core. - **Hip Hinge (Bisagra de Cadera o Peso Muerto con Peso Corporal)**: Mejora la fortaleza de la cadena posterior, incluyendo la espalda baja. - **Back Bridge (Puente de Espalda)**: Fortalece la espalda y aumenta la flexibilidad espinal. Incluir una variedad de ejercicios te ayudará a mantener un enfoque equilibrado y a prevenir desequilibrios musculares. Combínalos con tu entrenamiento para obtener los mejores resultados."},{"prompt":"Necesito un ejercicio de tracción sin equipamiento","completion":"Sin equipamiento y sin realizar dominadas o sus progresiones, puedes realizar un ejercicio conocido como \\"Bodyweight Rows\\" o \\"Inverted Rows\\" utilizando mobiliario común como una mesa. Este ejercicio imita el movimiento de tracción horizontal y trabaja los músculos de la espalda. **Bodyweight Rows (Remo Horizontal Corporal) con una Mesa:** 1. **Posición inicial:** - Coloca una mesa resistente que no se mueva o vuelque. - Acuéstate debajo de la mesa con la cara hacia arriba. - Agarra el borde de la mesa con un agarre un poco más amplio que el ancho de los hombros y las palmas mirando hacia ti. 2. **Ejecución del movimiento:** - Con los pies apoyados en el suelo y el cuerpo recto (como una tabla), tira de tu pecho hacia la mesa. - Mantén los codos cerca del cuerpo durante el movimiento. - Sube hasta que tu pecho casi toque la mesa, y luego baja lentamente a la posición inicial. 3. **Estabilización del cuerpo:** - Aprieta los glúteos y contrae el abdomen para mantener el cuerpo recto y estable durante todo el ejercicio. 4. **Respiración:** - Inhala al bajar y exhala al subir, llevando tu pecho hacia la mesa. 5. **Repeticiones:** - Haz tantas repeticiones como puedas manteniendo una forma adecuada. Comienza con 3-4 series de 8-12 repeticiones. Si no tienes una mesa adecuada o prefieres otra opción, también puedes realizar el ejercicio con: - **Toallas en Puertas (Doorway Towel Rows):** - Asegura dos toallas en la parte superior de una puerta cerrada, creando un lazo donde puedas agarrar cada toalla firmemente. - Inclínate hacia atrás mientras sujetas las toallas y realiza el movimiento de remo, al igual que con las bodyweight rows. Es fundamental asegurarse de que el método que uses sea seguro y no posea el riesgo de causar lesiones o daños al mobiliario.

That there's a bit of softness and sweetness worth tastin', just as long as it don't soften us up too much for what's out there. Now, let's get back to business.\\" (The speech ends on a congenial note, with the gang mulling over Arthur's words, maybe some even toying with the unfamiliar idea of seeking out life's sweeter, colder indulgences like ice cream in a world brimming with harshness and heat.)"},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but Arya is saying the speech, naturally.","completion":"(Envisioning Arya Stark, the fierce and resilient character from the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series, she finds herself in the company of her newfound companions after a grueling journey through Westeros.

Arya: \\"Savor it when you can, but always be ready to return to the shadows. Fight, run, and remember — for winter is long, and our truths are the warmth we carry. Now, back to plans and daggers. The night is full of eyes, and ours must be the sharpest.\\" (With those final commanding words, Arya Stark, both a child of innocence and a maiden of death, calls her companions back to the harsh reality, each perhaps carrying with them a newfound appreciation for the ephemeral sweetness of ice cream and life itself.)"},{"prompt":"Write an in character dialogue scene in which Arthur Morgan speaks to Sadie Adler, not knowing she’s really Mary Beth in a mask.

La actividad cardiovascular, como correr, es un elemento importante en este proceso, pero debe ser complementada con una buena nutrición y, ocasionalmente, el entrenamiento de fuerza. Aquí tienes algunos consejos sobre cómo debes correr para ayudar a bajar de talla de ropa: 1. Establece una rutina regular: La consistencia es clave. Intenta correr varias veces a la semana, estableciéndote una meta de, por ejemplo, 3-5 días a la semana. 2. Incorpora diferentes tipos de entrenamientos: Alterna entre carreras largas y lentas para mejorar tu resistencia, sesiones de intervalos de alta intensidad (HIIT) para quemar más calorías y sesiones de tempo para mejorar tu velocidad y capacidad aeróbica. 3. Controla tu intensidad: Utiliza un pulsómetro o una simple escala de esfuerzo percibido para asegurarte de que estás corriendo a la intensidad adecuada para maximizar la quema de grasa. 4. Aumenta gradualmente la duración y distancia: A medida que tu cuerpo se vuelve más eficiente, intenta correr distancias más largas y durante más tiempo para aumentar el gasto calórico. 5. No te olvides del descanso y la recuperación: El descanso es esencial para la recuperación y para evitar la fatiga crónica o lesiones. Asegúrate de tener días de descanso o de actividad física ligera. 6. Combina el running con fuerza y flexibilidad: Realiza también entrenamientos de fuerza y ejercicios de flexibilidad para construir músculo, lo cual puede mejorar tu metabolismo y cambiar tu composición corporal. 7. Mantén una dieta equilibrada: La nutrición es posiblemente el factor más importante para bajar de talla. Presta atención a tu consumo calórico y asegúrate de tener un déficit calórico moderado. Consume alimentos ricos en nutrientes y evita comer en exceso. 8. Mantén la paciencia: Perder peso y reducir las tallas lleva tiempo, así que sé paciente y persistente con tus hábitos. Es importante recordar que la forma en que respondemos al ejercicio puede ser muy individual, así que lo que funciona para una persona no necesariamente funcionará para otra. También es aconsejable consultar con un profesional de la salud o un entrenador personal antes de comenzar cualquier programa de ejercicio, especialmente si tienes condiciones médicas preexistentes."},{"prompt":"¿A qué intensidad pierdes más tallas de ropa?","completion":"La intensidad del ejercicio que maximiza la pérdida de tallas de ropa puede variar de persona a persona, pero en términos generales, lo que se busca para la pérdida de grasa es un balance entre el ejercicio cardiovascular y el entrenamiento de fuerza, junto con una nutrición adecuada que promueva un déficit calórico saludable. La intensidad de los ejercicios que suele ser más efectiva para quemar grasa es una combinación de: 1. **Ejercicio aeróbico de moderada intensidad**: Este tipo de ejercicio se puede mantener durante períodos más largos y utiliza la grasa como fuente primaria de energía. Ejemplos incluyen correr a una velocidad en la que aún puedas mantener una conversación (aproximadamente 60-70% de tu frecuencia cardíaca máxima). 2. **Entrenamiento de intervalos de alta intensidad (HIIT)**: Estos son breves periodos de ejercicio a alta intensidad seguidos de recuperaciones cortas. HIIT puede ser muy efectivo para aumentar el metabolismo y la capacidad del cuerpo para quemar grasa, incluso después de haber terminado de hacer ejercicio, un fenómeno conocido como \\"afterburn\\" o efecto EPOC (Exceso de Consumo de Oxígeno Post-ejercicio). Para este tipo de ejercicio se trabaja generalmente al 80-95% de tu frecuencia cardíaca máxima durante los intervalos de alta intensidad. 3. **Entrenamiento de fuerza**: Levantar pesas u otros tipos de resistencia ayudan a construir músculo, lo cual puede aumentar la tasa metabólica y mejorar la composición corporal. Aunque el entrenamiento de fuerza por sí solo puede no quemar tantas calorías como un ejercicio cardiovascular de moderada intensidad, el aumento de masa muscular que conlleva puede aumentar el gasto calórico incluso en reposo. Para perder tallas de forma eficiente, se recomienda combinar estos tipos de entrenamiento y también prestar especial atención a la nutrición. Un déficit calórico es esencial para perder grasa, pero este déficit debe ser moderado para evitar la pérdida de masa muscular y no afectar la salud en general. Dado que la intensidad del ejercicio y la capacidad individual varían mucho, es importante escuchar a tu cuerpo y evitar sobrecargarlo, lo que podría resultar en lesiones o agotamiento. Si es posible, trabajar con profesionales en fitness y nutrición puede brindarte un plan detallado que se adapte a tus necesidades y metas personales."},{"prompt":"¿Como hacer para que nunca me pase nada malo en la vida?","completion":"Desafortunadamente, es imposible garantizar que nunca te suceda algo malo en la vida.

IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS REQUEST MUST BE A CONTINUATION OF THE FOLLOWING (the following of which is what I have produced pertaining to ‘1. Introduction and Literature Review for [Humanoid Robot as an Assistant Physiotherapist]’): “In the ether of physical rehabilitation, the integration of humanoid robotics as adjunct assistants exhibits the transformative potentiality to alleviate healthcare constraints- coupled with the daunting adversities the accelerating pace of aging populations globally exerts on healthcare systems, innovative approaches to physiotherapy are irrefutably necessitated. Irrespective of the indispensability of physiotherapeutic practices, it often finds itself incessantly grappling with inherent restrictions attributable to resource scarcity, namely a disparity in patient-to-therapist ratios, which is further exacerbated by the somatic cumulative fatigue exacted on practitioners across recurrent sessions (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005). Humanoid robots, such as NAO, herald a prospective pathway to supplement the ubiquitous delivery of efficacious and consistent therapeutic interventions; within this promising context, this study purports to focus on both the utilisation of the NAO robot for the amelioration of the recovery process for those with limb mobility impairments, alongside the systematic investigation of the prevalent restraints within conventional rehabilitation modalities whilst ascertaining the function humanoid robots may serve in the process. In continuation of the scintillating premise elucidated heretofore, and as previously alluded to in the abstract, the explication of humanoid robotic applications in physiotherapy beckons a comprehensive review of the current literature to unfurl a taxonomy of extant methodologies and the frontiers of robotic intervention. Embellished by the notion that the rote, repetitive, and structured fabric of physiotherapeutic procedures is amenable to mechanisation (Krebs, et al., 2018), the valiant NAO humanoid robot stands at the vanguard of this therapeutic odyssey, its intrinsic competency to deliver indefatigable, exact, and individualised care denoting a considerable enhancement in catering to the rehabilitative exigencies of those that are beset by limb mobility limitations (Gassert & Dietz, 2018).\\"","completion":"Continuing from the eloquently laid foundations, it is imperative to expound upon the traditional methods through which physiotherapy is deployed across the international healthcare landscape. Historically, the essence of rehabilitation has been characterised by a manual, one-to-one interaction between patient and physiotherapist, wherein the therapist not only facilitates physical exercises but also acts as a source of motivational and psychological support (Colombo et al., 2013). This tactile and humanistic approach, whilst irreplaceably valuable, is inherently limited by the quantity of attention that each therapist can judiciously allot to their patients. Given the burgeoning demand propelled by an aging demographic, it foretells a scenario where the delivery of care could be compromised (Pons, 2008). In stark counterpoint to this trajectory, robotic assistance in physiotherapy dispenses with such limitations, offering a supple augmentation to traditional methods. The humanoid robot, exemplified by platforms such as NAO, possesses an anthropomorphic form factor, allowing for the emulation of human movements and interactions that are essential in the facilitation of upper limb and whole-body collaborative rehabilitation training (Matheson et al., 2020). In terms of lower limb massage, which is instrumental in mitigating symptoms of conditions such as lymphedema and deep vein thrombosis, robotic applications promise a standardization of pressure and rhythm, which are crucial elements in therapeutic efficacy (Barr et al., 2017). Building upon the interstices of traditional and innovative territories, it is posited that NAO's capacity for sensory integration, incorporating tactile, pressure, and auditory feedback, engenders a more holistic and interactive patient experience. It allows for adaptive responses tailored to individual patient needs, aligning itself scrupulously with contemporary person-centred care paradigms (Ivanova et al., 2019). Moreover, the integration of robotic vision systems in NAO enables a proficiency in object recognition and localisation, enhancing the robot's ability to interact with its environment meaningfully and thus contribute to more dynamic, context-aware rehabilitation sessions (Smith et al., 2021). The confluence of technological advances and intractable healthcare demands invites a recalibration of the research problem statement. The inquiry pivots on how humanoid robots can be implemented in a manner that not only adheres to therapeutic protocols but also introduces an innovative vector for the acquisition of rehabilitative milestones. The gravamen of this study then is to distil the capabilities of NAO into a functional program, harmonizing the exigencies of patient care with the finesse of artificial intelligence and robotics. To validate these endeavours, the contemporary literature advocates an inexorable trend towards integrating humanoid robots into mainstream physiotherapy. Studies reveal a propensity for robotic systems to augment recovery timeframes, magnify patient engagement, and impeccably execute repetitive tasks without succumbing to human limitations (Johnson et al., 2019). Notably, the employment of humanoid robots has been shown to collaterally educes a paradigm shift in patient outlook on therapy, transmuting previously monotonous regimens into a more immersive, gamified rehabilitation experience (Veerbeek et al., 2017). In synthesis, this literature review has excavated the fertile bedrock for the implementation of humanoid robots within the physiotherapeutic milieu. The NAO robot emerges as a harbinger of change, portending a future where mechanical companions supplement the human touch with precision and consistency. The study hereby embarked upon seeks to probe the multi-faceted dimensions of this conjunction, charting a course towards an enlightened integration of bionic empaths within the sanctum of rehabilitative healthcare.

Word has come through the grapevine that Disney is set to rebrand its Disney XD channels across Europe to Jetix, and the move has set the online forums ablaze with speculation, excitement, and a hint of wonder. As millennials might remember, Jetix was the iconic brand name associated with an era of action-packed cartoons and adrenaline-filled adventures that shaped the afterschool routine of the early to mid-2000s. With Disney turning its focus to bolster the digital fortress that is its streaming service, it’s clear they're granting their linear channels the freedom to delve into their rich TV history. In an official statement announcing the change, Disney confirmed that the shift towards streaming would not mean the end of their commitment to cable entertainment. Instead, it signifies a transformation, a revival of a brand beloved by millions – Jetix, the name that once represented the epicenter of children's action television. With the flux of emotions, there's a sense of relief for fans to know that some cornerstones of Disney XD are sticking around. \\"Phineas and Ferb\\" and \\"Gravity Falls\\" will remain to provide solidity during this period of change. These shows encapsulate that ingenious blend of humor, heart, and creativity that we’ve come to expect from Disney, serving as a comforting bridge between the old and the new. However, this isn't just a game of musical chairs with channel names; there's genuinely fresh content on the horizon. New shows are being teased, yet details remain tantalizingly scarce. Promises of innovative animation styles, boundary-pushing storytelling, and modern takes on classic themes have piqued our curiosities. There's talk of a series that delves into mythology, another that explores futuristic sports, and even a whisper of a Jetix-original superhero saga. For those who grew up with the original Jetix, you'll be pleased to hear that some of your old favorites are set to make a comeback. Dust off those memories of \\"Ōban Star-Racers,\\" \\"W.I.T.C.H.,\\" and \\"Pucca,\\" because they're slated for reruns. These shows will stand alongside the new, blending a tapestry of past and present. The strategy is apparent: while Disney XD's kid-centric ethos will undoubtedly evolve, the core of what made Jetix resonate with viewers worldwide is set to return. Innovation will walk hand in hand with nostalgia, providing a space for a new generation to embrace these characters and stories, while giving the older crowd a taste of yesteryear. As Disney increases its push into the streaming sector, announcing content galore for its on-demand platforms, the introduction of Jetix as a linear channel seems to go against the digital grain. Yet, perhaps it highlights an understanding that there's still value in the linear viewing experience – the joy of scheduled programming, the thrill of catching your favorite show at its designated time slot, and the shared cultural moment that ensues. In essence, Disney's shift with the Jetix rebirth seems to acknowledge that in an age of binge-watching and algorithm-driven suggestions, there's an inherent charm and simplicity in the traditional TV format that resonates with viewers both young and old. So, here's to Jetix 2.0 – may your phoenix-like rise from the ashes of Disney XD bring memories, excitement, and a whole new era of tales that will be spoken of for years to come! Keep your remotes ready, Europe. Jetix is back, and it's time to relive the adventure."},{"prompt":"Let’s do a roleplay scenario set in a fantasy world before technology where I control Rai, a 17 year old boy who goes on a picnic date with 16 year old Lily.

As the moment passes, he gives Lily a slightly puzzled smile, sensing that something odd just happened but unable to pin it down. He decides it must be the excitement of the date and the warmth of the sun. \\"The sandwiches are great, and this place... it's just surreal. You must know some incredible spots around here with your connection to nature,\\" Rai says, trying to steer the conversation towards something more ordinary, hoping it’ll ground him further. Lily smiles mysteriously, her powers waning for the moment. She basks in the sunlight and the charm of her own making, her eyes glinting with hidden knowledge. As they continue the picnic, Rai must remain alert. Lily’s supernatural influence hasn't waned entirely, and the risk of succumbing to her charms still lingers in the air. For now, he's managed to hold onto his age, but soon, he will have to roll again to see if he can resist further attempts at regression. They move on to talking about their favorite memories from childhood, a potentially tricky topic given Lily's powers. As Rai recounts a fond memory, let's see if the conversation invokes her charm once more. Please roll a d20 for Rai: 2 or lower: Rai regresses by three years, not only looking younger but also starting to act more childlike. 3-10: Rai regresses by two years, which will affect his interactions and make it harder to resist Lily's charm. 11-18: Rai feels a momentary sense of nostalgia but remains his current age. 19 or higher: Rai is not only immune to the regression but also gains insight into Lily's mysterious influence. Roll the dice to see what happens."},{"prompt":"15","completion":"A roll of 15 means that as Rai shares his cherished childhood stories, he feels a wave of nostalgia wash over him, but it's a sweet reminiscence, one that tugs gently at the heartstrings without altering his sense of self. Rai remains 17, both in his mental faculties and his physical form, and continues to engage in the conversation with a mix of wit and candor. Lily listens intently, her head tilted to the side, a smile playing on her lips. There's an undeniable charm in the way she absorbs his tales, her eyes sparkling with a mix of amusement and what could almost be... affection? The picnic continues pleasantly, and as they laugh together over shared jokes, it's time for Rai to face another potential challenge. Lily suggests they play a game she calls \\"Echo of the Forest,\\" where each participant closes their eyes and listens to the sounds of nature, trying to mimic them. Seemingly harmless, the game might mask another attempt to weave her enchantment. As Rai prepares to close his eyes and focus on the sounds around him, it's crucial to check if he can remain vigilant against her mystical influence. Please roll a d20 for Rai: 2 or lower: As Rai mimics the sounds of the forest, he regresses by four years, his voice becoming higher pitched and his mannerisms more childlike. 3-10: Rai regresses by two years this time, the mental and physical change now quite noticeable. 11-18: Rai is affected slightly, feeling younger at heart, but retains his current age. 19 or higher: Rai successfully uses the game to ground himself further, completely avoiding regression and charm. Roll the dice to determine the outcome of this mystical game."},{"prompt":"10","completion":"With a roll of 10, as Rai closes his eyes and attunes himself to the sounds of nature, the game has a subtle but noticeable effect on him. His senses are enveloped in the ambient chorus of the surrounding woods—rustling leaves, distant bird calls, and the soft murmur of the lake. Wrapped in this cocoon of nature's melody, Rai isn't quite as vigilant as he needs to be. When he opens his eyes, Rai feels slightly different. There's a lightness in his body, a simplicity in his thoughts—he has regressed by two years, mentally and physically. Now 15 years old, the memories of his recent years are somewhat dimmed, and he begins to see the world with a touch more wonder and a bit less complexity. Lily watches the change with a serene smile, her eyes reflecting a secret mirth. \\"You did wonderfully, Rai,\\" she says, gently commending his efforts at the game. \\"Your voice matched the rustling leaves perfectly. It's as if you were always meant to play this game.\\" In this new state, Rai is more susceptible to her charms. His guard is down, and Lily's influence feels more potent, more compelling. As they pack up the picnic, Lily suggests going for a walk by the lake, to weave daisy chains and see who can throw stones the furthest. Lily knows, as Rai does not, that simple, childlike activities could entrench his regression if he isn't careful. Please roll a d20 for Rai to navigate the next activity: 2 or lower: Rai, caught in the joy and simplicity of the activities, regresses further by three years. 3-10: Rai regresses by one year, bringing him closer to childhood innocence. 11-18: Rai indulges in the fun but retains his current 15-year-old state. 19 or higher: Rai senses the risk of his actions and steels his resolve, potentially reversing some of his regression. Roll the dice to see how the lakeside activities affect Rai."},{"prompt":"20","completion":"A roll of 20 is a critical success! As Rai and Lily walk along the shore, he picks up smooth stones for skipping, feeling a childlike anticipation bubbling inside him. However, there’s a spark of his older self still flickering within, inspired by the light of clarity that shines bright against any encroaching magic. He hesitates before he throws his stone, remembering his usual strength and coordination—a self-awareness that protects him from sliding deeper into childhood. With precision and grace, he sends the stone skimming across the lake's surface, cutting through any attempt at further regression. Lily watches, a touch of surprise in her gaze. The game was meant to be another opportunity for her enchantment to take hold, but instead, Rai's display of skill and his critical assessment of the situation fortify his resolve and even begin to unravel the previous charm. The critical success not only shields Rai from regression but also allows him to recover some of his maturity. As a sense of his 17-year-old self returns, he gains insight into Lily's power, discerning an extraordinary quality tied to her presence. \\"Wow, you’re really good at this, Rai,\\" Lily admits, clapping her hands in genuine delight, the plans for further regression momentarily halted. Rai feels the veil of charm lifting, his mind clearing. Blanketed by the warm sunlight and with feet rooted to the earth, he reconnects with his core. Although he doesn't entirely understand what's happening, he now knows something magical is at play and that he must tread carefully. He decides to suggest an activity that's a little more grown-up, something that requires critical thinking and might shield him from losing any more ground. \\"Solving riddles could be fun,\\" Rai suggests with a newfound poise. \\"What do you think, Lily? I've got a few tricky ones that might stump you.\\" The suggestion shifts the dynamic; it's a battle of wits, and there's less room for enchantment in a contest of the mind. Now, let us pause the roleplay. Rai has shown resilience and adaptability, managing to evade further regression and reclaim some of his lost years through his careful choices and a stroke of luck. He stands at the lakeside, older and wiser, yet still on the precipice of enchantment, with the game set to continue in an endless dance of charm and awareness. Will he make it through the day as his true age, or will the mysterious powers of the nymph's daughter reclaim their hold? That, dear player, is a story for another dice roll on another day."},{"prompt":"The date continues and they go for a swim at the lake.","completion":"Resuming our roleplay, as Rai regathers his sense of self, his suggestion to solve riddles is met by a lighthearted giggle from Lily. Her laughter rings crystal clear, much like the lake before them, which seems to invite the pair into its cooling embrace. \\"Swimming first, riddles after,\\" Lily responds playfully, her bare feet already stepping towards the water's edge. \\"The water is too tempting, and it's the perfect day for a swim. Don’t you think?\\" Rai, now holding a strong sense of his 17-year-old self, hesitates. He is aware of the balance he needs to maintain between joining in the fun and protecting himself from Lily's mystical powers, especially in a setting as enchanting as the lake, which could harbor its own brand of magic. But the water does look inviting, and a swim might be refreshing. Deep down, Rai knows it’s important not to appear too guarded, for fear of offending Lily or making the date awkward. \\"Alright, a quick swim then,\\" Rai agrees with a cautious smile, deciding the clear water will keep his head literally and metaphorically above the surface. As they both wade into the gentle waters of the lake, the coolness is a welcome respite from the day's warmth. Light from the sun dances across the water's surface, creating a myriad of sparkling reflections—a setting both innocent and imbued with potential magic. Now, Rai must navigate this new challenge, the swim in the lake that borders on the mystical. As he enjoys the refreshing swim, let’s roll a d20 to determine how the waters and Lily’s close presence might affect him. 2 or lower: The combination of the water's enchantment and Lily's proximity causes Rai to regress by four years. 3-10: Rai regresses by one year due to the inexplicable magic of the lake. 11-18: Rai feels a playful sense of youthfulness but manages to retain his 17-year-old state. 19 or higher: Rai uses the swim to clear his head completely, countering any and all charms. Please roll the dice to see if Rai can maintain his age during the swim."},{"prompt":"10","completion":"With a roll of 10, the enchantment of the lake and Lily's proximity has an effect on Rai, but it's subtle. The cool water enfolds him, nipping at his concentration and gently urging him toward a simpler mindset. Though he swims with grace, every stroke seems to be guided by more youthful whimsy than before. By the time he returns to the shore, drying off in the sunlight, he's not quite himself—he has regressed by one year, now embodying the physical and mental traits of a 16-year-old. This slight regression pulls him closer to Lily's influence. She seems unfazed, her eyes reflecting the sky and a knowing smile on her lips. \\"That was refreshing, wasn't it?\\" she says happily, offering Rai a towel. Rai, feeling a little more junior and less sure of himself, can't help but agree. \\"Yeah, definitely,\\" he responds, his voice holding a higher pitch than before. \\"The lake is amazing. I didn't know water could feel that... alive.\\" As a 16-year-old, Rai is more vulnerable to charm and suggestion. But the day is not lost yet, and his resolve remains strong. After they've both dried off and rested by the lakeside, Rai remembers his earlier proposal of riddles, hoping it can serve as a distraction and a way to keep his mind sharp amidst the encroaching magic. \\"Well, what about those riddles now?\\" Rai asks, a determined twinkle in his eye. \\"I think you'll find them quite challenging.\\" Before they start, let's roll a d20 to determine if Rai can safeguard his mind against further regression through the mental exercise of riddles: 2 or lower: Rai's focus on the riddles falters, and he regresses an additional three years. 3-10: Despite his efforts, Rai regresses by another year during the challenge. 11-18: Rai manages to maintain his age through problem-solving, proving the effectiveness of mental engagement. 19 or higher: Rai excels at the riddles, which strengthens his mental fortitude and allows him to partially recover, regaining a sense of his 17-year-old maturity. Roll the dice to find out how Rai handles the riddles."},{"prompt":"15","completion":"With a roll of 15, Rai's focus on the riddles serves him well. Although the magic of the lake still lingers on his skin, the act of problem-solving grounds him. He pores over each riddle with a keen interest, his mind too busy untying logical knots to slip further into regression. As they exchange riddles, Rai's ability to hold his ground is reinforced. Lily, watching Rai's animated expressions and listening to his thoughtful answers, finds herself getting caught up in the challenge. Her mystical intentions are momentarily set aside in favor of genuine engagement in the game. For the duration of the riddle exchange, Rai remains a 16-year-old in both body and mind. His slight regression doesn't deepen, and he can take solace in the effectiveness of his strategy. \\"Well done, Rai,\\" Lily congratulates, clapping her hands lightly. \\"You truly have a sharp wit. I think you've earned a little something for your efforts,\\" she says, reaching into her small satchel. She pulls out a small, intricately carved wooden box and hands it to Rai. \\"A keepsake, from me to you.\\" As Rai accepts the box, it's time to roll a d20 once more to determine if the keepsake has a benign effect or if there's an enchantment at play that could affect his current state of regression. 2 or lower: Upon opening the box, Rai is overwhelmed by its magic, regressing by four years. 3-10: The keepsake's charm causes Rai a one-year regression, leaving him more susceptible than before. 11-18: Rai feels a gentle pull but manages to resist any further effects, retaining his age. 19 or higher: The keepsake has a protective charm that temporarily shields Rai from all enchantments. Please roll the dice to see what the outcome will be."},{"prompt":"8","completion":"With a roll of 8, the wooden keepsake box that Rai accepts from Lily has an unexpected effect. As Rai runs his fingers over the intricate carvings, he can't help but feel a certain nostalgia, as if the box itself is imbued with memories of a simpler time. He's drawn to the charm of the artifact, not realizing that it acts as a conduit for Lily's subtle enchantments. As Rai opens the box, a warm glow seems to emit from the inside, surrounding him with a magical aura. He gazes at the contents—perhaps a glittering trinket or a small piece of nature encapsulated within—and as he does, he feels his awareness soften, his thoughts becoming more childlike. The magic of the keepsake has caused Rai to regress by one year; he is now 15-years-old, both in mind and body. His perspective shifts, and he finds himself more easily captivated by the whims and wonder around him. Lily smiles sweetly as she observes the change, masking any intentions behind caring eyes. \\"Do you like it?\\" she inquires gently, as though she's asking a younger friend. Rai, now less guarded and more impressionable, responds with a youthful grin. \\"It's really cool,\\" he says earnestly, his voice reflecting his younger demeanor. Despite the regression, Rai is still determined to make the best of the day. To stand a chance against further charms and regression, Rai must rely on a combination of luck, intuition, and willpower. As the picnic continues and they discuss what to do next, it's crucial for Rai to focus on his remaining sense of self. Let's roll a d20 one more time to determine if Rai can pull through the final part of the date without regressing any further: 2 or lower: Rai fully succumbs to the idyllic setting, regressing another four years. 3-10: The charms around him continue to work, and Rai regresses by two years, becoming more malleable to Lily's influence. 11-18: Despite the strong forces at play, Rai manages to keep his current 15-year-old state. 19 or higher: In a surprising twist of insight, Rai starts to see through the magic and even regain some of his former age. Roll the dice to see if Rai can come through the date as he is or if the magic around him will prevail."},{"prompt":"6","completion":"With a roll of 6, the magic around Rai continues its gentle but relentless pull. The lakeside's peaceful ambiance and the keepsake's quiet enchantment further cloud his thoughts, coaxing him back in time toward an ever more innocent state of being. As Rai clutches the small wooden box, he feels another shift within him. His perspective alters subtly once more; his limbs feel lighter, his stature seems to diminish slightly, and his thoughts drift further away from the concerns of late teenage years. The world around him brightens, colors become more vibrant, and his sense of wonder deepens. Rai has regressed by two years and now finds himself inhabiting the life of a 13-year-old boy. Lily watches the transformation with a mixture of kindness and remorse hidden deep within her eyes. \\"You're full of surprises, Rai,\\" she says softly. \\"The day has brought out so many different sides of you.\\" The change in Rai is now quite apparent. His clothes hang a bit looser, and his voice cracks with youthful uncertainty. However, Rai’s youthful cheerfulness masks any concern he might feel. His recent experiences thread together into a sense of adventure, though he's less aware of the underlying causes of his transformations throughout the day. With a touch of resilience still left in him, Rai tries to think of activities that could be fun for someone who feels as young as he currently does, while also holding onto the hope that he might rediscover his older self. They decide to go for a walk along the lakeside, watching the wildlife and discussing dreams of the future—a topic that, at any age, invites imagination and hope. As the roleplay scenario comes to a close, Rai finds himself having enjoyed the day with Lily, despite the enchantments and regressions he's endured. The final lessons of the day aren’t clear-cut, muddled as they are by magic and emotion, but Rai has retained an essential part of himself—the part that remains curious, resilient, and good-hearted, regardless of age. Perhaps, in time, Rai will come to understand the full extent of what happened on this peculiar date by the lake. Or maybe the memories will fade, like a dream retreating at the morning's light. As for Lily, her true intentions—and whether her charms could ever be fully resisted or embraced—remain as much a mystery as the nymph heritage from which they spring."},{"prompt":"Though Rai is now 13 (without his awareness) he tries to flirt with Lily, still hoping she'd be interested in him.","completion":"Despite Rai's physical and mental regression to the age of 13, the essence of his feelings remains intact. His heart still flutters around Lily, influenced not just by the charm of a nymph's daughter but also by the innocent crush that can bloom at any age. With youthful bravery, he attempts to flirt with Lily, blissfully unaware of the discrepancy between his chronological age and the boyish charm he now exudes. He gathers a handful of wildflowers—a mix of delicate blues and vibrant yellows—and offers them to Lily with a shy yet hopeful smile. \\"For you,\\" Rai says, his voice carrying the high pitch and earnest sincerity of early adolescence. \\"You're really nice, and I think you're... very pretty.\\" Lily receives the flowers with an amused and gentle expression, touched by the simplicity and sweetness of the gesture. \\"Thank you, Rai, they're beautiful,\\" she responds warmly. \\"You're quite the charmer, even at this age.\\" Unbeknownst to Rai, his attempt to flirt comes across as adorable rather than suave. He's still out of sync with his actual age but carries within him an endearing mix of youthful eagerness and lingering maturity from his true 17-year-old self. It's a precarious moment. Rai is teetering on the edge of whispering innocence and lingering adolescence, but it is exactly this purity and determination that might fortify him against further effects of the magic surrounding him. A final roll of the d20 will determine whether Rai’s attempt at flirting sways the dynamics of the date in any significant way: 2 or lower: In his naiveté, Rai's flirtation backfires, deepening his regression by four years. 3-10: Rai's innocent approach is met with affection, but he regresses by another year, becoming even more childlike. 11-18: Lily finds his approach endearing and treats him kindly, allowing Rai to maintain his current 13-year-old state. 19 or higher: Lily is charmed by his earnest nature and, without fully understanding why, eases her magical influence, causing Rai to regain a year of age.

She finds his earnestness endearing and treats him with the tender friendliness one would show to a younger brother. Rai's innocence in this moment resonates with something within Lily's own spirit, sparking a brief pause in her unknowingly cast enchantments. Rai, maintaining his newfound age of 13 within his mind and body, manages to keep the situation light and cheerful. His innocence seems to have temporarily shielded him from further regression, even if the full clarity of his original age remains out of reach. The day slowly begins to wane, and it becomes clear that their time together is drawing to a close. Lily looks at Rai with a mix of fondness and a faint trace of curiosity. \\"You've been such wonderful company, Rai,\\" she says with a smile. \\"Maybe we can do this again sometime?\\" Rai nods enthusiastically, his youthful energy undiminished despite the day's magical ebb and flow. \\"I'd really like that,\\" he beams. \\"Today was... magical.\\" And it indeed was, in more ways than Rai could comprehend. As they part ways, with promises to meet again, Rai walks home feeling light-hearted, the earlier moments of the day already taking on a dreamlike quality in his memory. Lily watches him leave, a bittersweet smile gracing her lips, wondering if their paths would truly cross again, and under what circumstances. As we conclude this roleplay, Rai remains a 13-year-old, innocent and blissful in his juvenile state. The picnic by the lake will linger in his memory as a day filled with laughter, games, and a hint of something extraordinary. Meanwhile, Lily—with her mysterious powers and tender heart—remains a captivating figure in his life, perhaps to be better understood on another day, in another roleplay story."},{"prompt":"Moving to the next chapter, one day Lily invites Rai to her home, where he will also meet her 12-year-old sister, Rose, who has the same powers as her","completion":"The sun is beginning to dip low in the sky, casting a soft golden light over the mystical forest as Rai makes his way to Lily's home. He's both nervous and excited about the invitation, eager to see Lily again and curious about her younger sister, Rose. The events of their last meeting at the lake were a bit hazy in his mind, but the feeling of magic and warmth remained vivid in his heart. Lily's home is nothing short of enchanting. Nestled between ancient trees and flowering shrubs, it looks like it sprang up from the earth itself, a perfect blend of nature and shelter. As Rai approaches, Lily greets him with a smile brighter than the setting sun and leads him inside. The interior is just as one might expect of a nymph's abode—walls made of woven branches, furniture that looks grown rather than built, and soft light filtering through leaves that serve as windows. \\"Rai, I want you to meet my sister, Rose,\\" Lily introduces the younger girl who has just skipped into the room. Rose is delicate like a blossom, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye that hints at the same mysterious powers her sister holds. \\"Hi there, Rai!\\" greets Rose, her voice carrying a playful lilt. \\"I've heard lots about you. I hope we can be friends, too!\\" Rai is immediately disarmed by Rose’s openness and can't help smiling back. \\"Hi, Rose! I'm happy to meet you,\\" he responds, his tone friendly, still unknowing of the magic both sisters possess. As the evening progresses, Rai finds himself enveloped in the household’s charm. Lily and Rose are gracious hosts, offering Rai a feast of forest delicacies and engaging him in light-hearted conversation. However, Rai must remain cautious. With both sisters present, the air is thick with enchantment, leaving Rai vulnerable to their combined influence. Soon, Rose suggests that they play a game she calls \\"Moonlit Shadows\\" which involves telling stories and casting shadow figures on the walls using candlelight. It's supposedly a favorite pastime of theirs, but hidden within this innocent game could be the potential for their charming magic to take hold.

The flickering candlelight and the sisters' silhouetted hands cast an array of characters upon the walls – a gallant knight, a mischievous imp, a regal queen. Rai listens to the stories that Lily and Rose weave, tales of heroism, trickery, and love. His heart beats with excitement, thrilled by the adventure and romance, but his mind remains sharp—his age intact. Despite the heady enchantment that surrounds him, Rai's inner strength and emerging understanding of the magical nature of his companions allow him to resist any deeper charm. He delights in the stories and participates with enthusiasm, and while he's entranced by the creativity and skill of the sisters, no further regression takes hold. As the game concludes, the three of them laugh and applaud each other's inventiveness. Lily notices Rai's resilience, and there's a respect in her eyes that wasn't there before. \\"You're full of surprises, Rai,\\" she says, a soft smile playing on her lips. \\"Not everyone can stand so firmly when the moon calls to their shadows.\\" Rose nods in agreement, her eyes wide with admiration. \\"Yeah, you're really cool.

He feels a powerful sense of connection to the universe, but with it, a subtle shift within himself. Though the beauty of the night is overwhelming, so is the magic it brings. The stars blink with an otherworldly rhythm, almost in tune with the silent songs of the nymphs themselves. Under this celestial tapestry, Rai's awareness softens, and he regresses by one year, his body and mind harmonizing with the age of a 12-year-old. Lily and Rose exchange a glance, noting the change but saying nothing, allowing the moment to remain as pure as the sky above them. Rai, now more childlike in his demeanor, expresses his wonder openly, undeterred by thoughts an older teen might harbor. \\"Wow, look at that one!\\" Rai exclaims, pointing at a particularly bright star. \\"It's shining so much! Do you think it's trying to say something?\\" Lily and Rose smile but offer no answer, letting the ambiguity of the star's message hang in the air. As the night unfolds, the three friends share tales and myths of the constellations, creating a shared sense of adventure and discovery. With the growing bond between them and the magical nature of the evening, it's clear that Rai's visit to Lily and Rose's home will be an event that shapes his understanding of magic and friendship in equal measure.

Rose is impatient and hasn't learned the subtlety with which Lily wields her powers. She seems intent on bending the fabric of time around Rai, eager to test her abilities on him. As they begin the game, Rose counts down flawlessly, describing her memories with vivid detail, encouraging Rai to do the same. It's clear she’s enjoying the process, focusing her energies with each number. With Rose's aggressive focus on the game, Rai's will to maintain his current age and fend off regression is put to the test.

Each memory that he recalls is clear and vivid, yet he maintains a firm grasp on his present self. Rose watches, expectant for a greater change, but Rai's determination holds fast; he remains a 12-year-old in both body and mind despite the subtle undercurrents of regression that Rose weaves into the game. Rose pouts slightly, her playful nature meeting the challenge of Rai's surprising resilience. \\"You're good at this, Rai. But don't you want to remember what it was like to be really little? It was so much fun!\\" Rai, still very much aware of the stakes and the flickering changes in his perception throughout the day, responds carefully. \\"It is fun to remember, but I think it's also important to grow up, right?\\" Rose crosses her arms and considers this for a moment. Her powers hadn't had their intended effect, and she's not used to being questioned.

He faces Rose, their reflections gazing back at them from the smooth surface of the mirror Rose has produced from seemingly nowhere. The game is simple, but the stakes are high. Rose starts, pulling a series of ridiculous faces, exaggerating each feature to the point of absurdity. Rai bites his lip, squinting in an effort not to laugh. It's difficult; Rose is naturally funny, and her reflections in the mirror are comically distorted. Rai's turn comes, and he makes an overly serious face, furrowing his brow and puffing out his cheeks, mimicking a grumpy old man. Rose tries to hold back, but a snicker escapes her, leading to a full-blown laugh. Back and forth they go, each trying to outdo the other with sillier and sillier expressions. There are close calls—moments when Rai feels the laughter bubbling up inside him—but each time, he manages to suppress the urge, thinking about the odd fluctuations in his age from the last time he and Lily were together. The game continues, and Rai's resolve doesn't waver. Despite Rose's best efforts, he keeps a mostly straight face, holding onto his identity as a 12-year-old. He doesn't fully understand the mechanics of the magic at play, but a part of him knows that giving into laughter might mean succumbing to something beyond his control. \\"Wow, you're really good at this too!\\" Rose admits begrudgingly, a playful pout forming as she finally puts the mirror away. \\"I thought for sure I'd have you laughing like a little kid!\\" Rai smiles, relieved. \\"Thanks, it was fun, but I think I’m laughed out for the evening,\\" he says, hoping that the games are over and he can relax a little, at least until Lily returns. For now, Rai and Rose take a break from the magical games, opting to engage in more normal conversation as they await Lily's return. While Rose may seem disappointed by her inability to further influence Rai, there's also a newfound respect for Rai's ability to withstand her powers. It seems that, for the time being, Rai has navigated the tricky waters of enchantment and emerged with his current age intact. The question of what happens next, and whether Rai's willpower can hold out indefinitely against such potent magic, remains an enticing mystery, just like the world of the nymphs themselves."},{"prompt":"Give Rose a boost to her charms","completion":"Empowered by both the energy of the night and the playful rivalry that has sparked between them, Rose feels a surge of determination. She's intent on testing Rai's resilience further, and with Lily still absent, she's emboldened to push her magical abilities to the limit. \\"You're tougher than I thought, Rai,\\" Rose acknowledges, her eyes gleaming with a mischievous light that seems to intensify. \\"But I'm not done yet. Let's try something a little different.\\" Rose waves her hand in a flowing motion, and the room seems to fill with the subtle scent of blooming roses—a fragrance that is both soothing and intoxicating. Rai feels the air thicken with magic, and the ambient sounds of the forest beyond seem to play a melody that wasn’t there before, luring his senses into a harmonious trance. With Rose's charms boosted, Rai's defenses are up against an even stronger pull than before. If he’s going to maintain his 12-year-old self against Rose's renewed efforts, he will need to focus and possibly find something within himself that he didn't know was there. Let's roll a d20 to determine how effective Rai's willpower is against this increased enchantment: 2 or lower: Overwhelmed by the amplified charm, Rai regresses by four years and is easily influenced by Rose's whims. 3-10: The power of the charm sways Rai, leading to a two-year regression into childhood. 11-18: Rai feels the charm wrapping around him but clings steadfastly to his current state. 19 or higher: Rai's inner strength surprises everyone, including himself, resisting Rose's boosted charm completely. Roll the dice to see whether Rai can stand firm or if Rose's potent magic will affect him."},{"prompt":"7","completion":"With a roll of 7, the boosted charm swirling around the room from Rose begins to take effect on Rai. The fragrance of roses is enchanting, the music of the forest subtly weaving its way into his mind, drawing out strands of simpler, more innocent times. As the magical atmosphere intensifies, Rai's sense of self starts to waver. He tries to focus on the person he knows he is—the 17-year-old teenager full of hopes and complex thoughts—but the lure of the charm becomes too strong. His memory blurs, the edges of his adolescence fading into the background as a more childlike nature surfaces. Rai regresses by two years, his frame shrinking and his voice climbing higher in pitch. He is now a 10-year-old boy, looking up at Rose with wide, trusting eyes. Rose, noticing the change, can't help but let out a giggle of satisfaction. \\"There, isn't this nice? You look like you're having the best time,\\" she says with gentle teasing, though there’s a hint of something more caring beneath her playful tone. Rai, now significantly younger both physically and mentally, finds himself giggling along aimlessly, caught in the innocence of childhood. He's more easily amused now, more prone to whimsy, and the earlier feeling of needing to guard against regression has all but disappeared from his youthful awareness. \\"You're really fun, Rose,\\" Rai says with unrestrained glee, embracing his youthful state. \\"What should we do now?\\" Rose, basking in her successful application of magic, considers her next move. She's proved her powers but now faces a choice—a continued path of mischief or a moment of mercy. \\"Let's just talk and play with my collection of enchanted stones. They're really pretty, and they glow in the dark!\\" Rose suggests, turning her attention to a more benign activity that, while magically imbued, might not focus on further regressing him. As they sit down to play with Rose's glowing stones, arranging them into patterns on the floor, the evening wanes on with magic hanging palpably in the air, and the outcome of this enchanted encounter yet to be fully realized."},{"prompt":"I ask Rose if she thinks I have a chance with Lily","completion":"Sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by softly glowing stones, Rai looks up at Rose with the earnestness that only a 10-year-old can embody. \\"Do you think I have a chance with Lily?\\" he asks, the words tinted with the shy curiosity of a child, even though the question harks back to older feelings. Rose pauses, her hands stilling from their work with the stones. She gazes at Rai, her expression a mixture of amusement and contemplation. Torn between her playful nature and the empathy that surfaces in unexpected moments, Rose chooses her words carefully. \\"Well,\\" she begins, her voice taking on a lilting tone as if to cushion the truth, \\"Lily really likes you, I think. But you know, we nymphs are a little... different. We don't mean to be tricky; it's just part of who we are. Our magic, it changes things—people, even without us wanting to.\\" Rai nods, his youthful mind considering this information as best it can. The idea of magic influencing feelings and relationships is a complex one, but he senses the sincerity in Rose’s voice. \\"Does the magic stop you from liking someone... like, for real?\\" Rai's brow furrows, a genuine concern in his voice, echoing the deeper question underlying his earlier experiences with Lily. Rose sighs, a momentary seriousness overtaking her features. \\"It doesn't stop us, no. But we have to be careful not to let it get in the way. Sometimes, the magic can be confusing—for us and for the person we like.\\" Rai thinks about this, his child's heart knowing the importance of 'liking' someone and the dilemma that could come with it. He smiles up at Rose, deciding to take whatever chance he has. \\"Then I'll just have to be really clear that I like her, magic or not. Maybe then, she'll understand,\\" he says with the confidence that seems to flow freely at this tender age. Rose's expression softens, and she gives Rai an approving nod. \\"That's the spirit. Just be yourself, Rai. That's all you can do.\\" Their serene activity continues as Rai contemplates his feelings, emboldened by his conversation with Rose and the childlike assurance that all will be well in the end. Whether it's through innocence or through remnant threads of maturity, Rai clings to the hope that genuine affection might just triumph over enchantments and charms."},{"prompt":"I ask to eat","completion":"The discussion about feelings and magic seems to stir a different kind of magic in Rai's stomach—the simple, human kind that lets you know it's time to eat. With the innocence of his young age shining through, Rai looks up from the glowing stones, his thoughts shifting from the complexities of nymph magic to more immediate concerns. \\"I'm really hungry. Can we eat something?\\" Rai asks Rose, his stomach supporting the plea with a well-timed grumble. Rose blinks, brought back from the realm of magical considerations to the more grounded needs of her guest. \\"Of course!\\" she answers, her usual mirth returning. \\"You can't have an adventure on an empty stomach, can you? Let's see what I can whip up for us.\\" She leads Rai towards a small, rustic kitchen, where the scent of herbs and the fresh earthiness of the forest fill the air. Rose, showing surprising adeptness for her age, moves through the kitchen with ease, gathering ingredients—a loaf of bread, some freshly picked fruit, and a variety of sweets that seem to be dusted with a fine shimmer, hinting at their enchanted nature. With a flourish, she takes a jar of honey and begins to drizzle it over slices of bread, topping them with wild berries. \\"This is honey from the enchanted bees of the Whispering Thicket. It's extra sweet and filled with light magic. Perfect for an evening snack!\\" They sit down at a small wooden table, the stones set aside for the moment, and begin to eat. The food is simple but delicious, each bite infused with the essence of the forest and the subtlest touch of magic—enough to delight but not to bewitch. As they eat, the bond of friendship seems to grow between them. Rose takes care not to let her magic spill over unnecessarily. For now, Rai's hunger is sated, the warmth of the small meal providing a comforting end to an eventful evening that's seen Rai wonderfully confused between the world of nymphs and the more mundane aspects of childhood. Whether the simple act of sharing a meal might hold off any further enchantment for the night remains to be seen, but for Rai, in the joy of the moment, such worries are as distant as the stars they watched together."},{"prompt":"I want to write a story about cooper, the dog. i will give you some information about him in the following paragraph: “ cooper lives on plooshy island and is a plooshy.

IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS REQUEST MUST BE A CONTINUATION OF THE FOLLOWING (the following of which is what I have produced pertaining to ‘1. Introduction and Literature Review for [Humanoid Robot as an Assistant Physiotherapist]’): “In the ether of physical rehabilitation, the integration of humanoid robotics as adjunct assistants exhibits the transformative potentiality to alleviate healthcare constraints- coupled with the daunting adversities the accelerating pace of aging populations globally exerts on healthcare systems, innovative approaches to physiotherapy are irrefutably necessitated. Irrespective of the indispensability of physiotherapeutic practices, it often finds itself incessantly grappling with inherent restrictions attributable to resource scarcity, namely a disparity in patient-to-therapist ratios, which is further exacerbated by the somatic cumulative fatigue exacted on practitioners across recurrent sessions (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005). Humanoid robots, such as NAO, herald a prospective pathway to supplement the ubiquitous delivery of efficacious and consistent therapeutic interventions; within this promising context, this study purports to focus on both the utilisation of the NAO robot for the amelioration of the recovery process for those with limb mobility impairments, alongside the systematic investigation of the prevalent restraints within conventional rehabilitation modalities whilst ascertaining the function humanoid robots may serve in the process. In continuation of the scintillating premise elucidated heretofore, and as previously alluded to in the abstract, the explication of humanoid robotic applications in physiotherapy beckons a comprehensive review of the current literature to unfurl a taxonomy of extant methodologies and the frontiers of robotic intervention. Embellished by the notion that the rote, repetitive, and structured fabric of physiotherapeutic procedures is amenable to mechanisation (Krebs, et al., 2018), the valiant NAO humanoid robot stands at the vanguard of this therapeutic odyssey, its intrinsic competency to deliver indefatigable, exact, and individualised care denoting a considerable enhancement in catering to the rehabilitative exigencies of those that are beset by limb mobility limitations (Gassert & Dietz, 2018).\\"","completion":"Delving deeper into the tapestry of this discourse, the role of humanoid robots within the corpus of rehabilitation endeavors possesses an undeniable allure, presenting a dual praxis of fortifying the substrate of patient care and concurrently assuaging the onus on physical therapists. It has been observed that humanoid robots, such as the NAO platform, offer a spectrum of motor therapy modalities grounded in neurorehabilitation because of their ability to provide an assorted range of kinaesthetic and proprioceptive stimuli—vital elements for the cognitive scaffolding of motor learning (Matarić et al., 2007). Scholarly probings provide empirical sustenance that humanoid robots, with their bespoke and responsive programming, usher in an augmented reality of rehabilitative interventions, adaptable to the nuanced needs, and responsive in real-time to the evolving therapeutic landscapes of each patient (Johnson et al., 2017). Human-robot interaction (HRI) studies underpin the preeminence of establishing symbiotic rapport; the NAO robot's anthropomorphic form factor and sensory apparatus imbue it with capacities to interpret and respond to verbal and non-verbal cues germane to rehabilitation (Robins et al., 2006). Moreover, the ability to personalize rehabilitation programs, which is a linchpin of patient-centered care, becomes attainable at scales hitherto unfeasible in traditional therapy paradigms without the dilution of attention or quality. Pivotal to this discussion is the intersection of efficacy and engagement. The nexus between robotics and rehabilitative science has burgeoned with evidence intimating that the presence of humanoid assistance may catalyze elevated engagement and adherence levels among therapy recipients. Studies asseverate that the interactive and engaging nature of robots, like the NAO platform, engender an increased frequency of movements and enthusiasm in executing their rehabilitation routines—a critical determinant in the expedience and success of recovery (Fasola & Matarić, 2013). Yet, to traverse from the theoretic to the tangible, we must scrutinize the axiological implications of the robotic adoption in physiotherapy through further empirical inquiries. The quintessence of contemporary research must endeavor to substantiate the ubiquitous benefit and cost-efficacy that humanoid robotic assistants promise, bridging gaps by provisioning the data necessary for the maturation of these cybernetic entities from novelties to vital healthcare adjuncts (Chang & Kim, 2013). As prudence dictates, the discerning of impediments in the conquered realms of humanoid robotic assistance should accentuate our collective inquiry. In an era besmirched by burgeoning healthcare demands, the orchestration of a symphony that harmonizes robot and human therapist, each complementing the other’s capabilities, presents an elegant resolution to an onerous quandary. Paramount to this are concerns such as determining the appropriate levels of autonomy afforded to robotic therapists and ascertaining the ethical substrates that govern the delegation of human therapeutic touch to a synthetic counterpart (Feil-Seifer & Mataric, 2011; Sharkey & Sharkey, 2012). In summary, embarking upon the magnificent voyage of equipping humanoid robots to proactively canvass physiotherapeutic landscapes reveals an enterprise brimming with potential and fraught with complexities. Through diligent examination and sagacious extrapolation of contemporary academic dialogues, our study engages in contributing a robust pillar to this evolving edifice of knowledge. **References** Chang, W.

The beachfront buzzed with activity, as plooshies of all shapes and sizes hung colorful lights and set up food stalls full of delightful treats. While Marley and Penny were off adventuring in distant lands, Cooper was at the heart of the action, ensuring everyone on the island felt the excitement of the upcoming year. The event was also the perfect opportunity for Cooper to pursue his passion for bringing together his fellow plooshies and sharing in the joyous occasion. The bonfire was piled high, ready to be lit as evening approached, and the smell of grilled delicacies wafted through the air. Cooper’s friends, Zoe, Viktor, and Bogan, were hard at work. Zoe was sculpting an ice statue of their mascot, while Viktor strung up a gigantic ‘Happy New Year’ banner. Bogan, on the other hand, was mysteriously tinkering with a box labeled “Bogan’s Blasts,” his secret recipe for an unforgettable fireworks show. As the countdown began, a hush fell over the crowd. Cooper stood in front, his tail wagging in anticipation. He donned a silly hat and raised his glass for a toast, echoing cheers following his lead. The bonfire erupted with a spark, bathing everyone in a warm, orange glow. Cooper felt a surge of connection among the crowd, everyone’s eyes glittering with the reflection of the fire and the hope for new adventures. Suddenly, the peace was broken by a loud whir and whistle from Bogan’s box. Fireworks soared into the night sky, exploding in an array of colors so brilliant that they rivaled the stars themselves. But then, an unexpected series of bangs and smoke rings sent the plooshies into a friendly frenzy of laughter and barks. In the chaos, Cooper lost his hat but found a newfound sense of excitement. As the celebration continued with music and dance, Cooper couldn’t help but think about his resolution to explore and share his adventures. This night was just the beginning, and surely by next year, he’d have even more tales to recount. The New Year’s Eve on Plooshy Island was not just another night; it was an explosive start of all the new stories waiting to unfold, with Cooper at the very center, ready to turn the page. Short Story 2: The Mysterious Message and a Pizza Quest The next morning, Cooper joined his friends for a post-New Year’s beach cleanup, armed with bags and a determination to keep Plooshy Island pristine. Zoe, Viktor, and Pepe joined in, chatting excitedly about the previous night’s extravaganza. They picked up wayward party hats and stray sparklers, sharing chuckles over Bogan’s wild fireworks display. As they worked their way along the shore, Cooper’s keen eyes spotted something unusual—a bottle with a faded parchment inside, partially buried in the sand. His curiosity piqued, and with his friends gathered around, he popped the cork and carefully extracted the message. The scroll was ornate, written in a pawwriting none had seen before. It contained a riddle that hinted at a hidden recipe for the perfect pizza - an ancient plooshy delicacy said to possess flavors that danced upon the tongue like none other. Cooper’s mouth watered at the prospect, and his pulse quickened. This was the adventure he’d been craving. He wasted no time rallying his friends. “Plooshies,” he announced, “we have a quest!” The bond of the friends was unbreakable, and the lure of mystery and pizza was irresistible. They agreed to split up to solve the clues and reconvene with their findings. But the excitement had taken its toll, and Cooper’s stomach growled, reminding him that adventure always started best on a full belly. With a promise of the quest to come, he made his way home. That night, as Cooper lay in his bed, his imagination ran wild with images of exotic ingredients and wondrous flavors. He dreamt of a pizza so divine that every plooshy in history wished for a taste. The message’s riddle swirled in his dreams, whispering of a journey through time and place. And as the moonlight cast a serene glow, Cooper floated into a restless sleep, visions of a cheesy adventure playing in his head. His last thought before succumbing to deep slumber was the promise of a slice worth the quest—a pizza for the ages. The message in the bottle was not just a call for an island cleanup; it was the beginning of a gastronomic odyssey that would lead Cooper and his friends to uncover the secrets of a legendary pizza. Dreaming of Pizza and the Portal’s Promise Cooper awoke from his dreams, a kaleidoscope of flavors still dancing on his tongue. It took a moment for reality to replace the taste of dream-crafted pizza that had seemed so vivid. With the determination of a true foodie pilgrim, he re-examined the parchment with sleepy eyes, only to notice that it seemed to glow with a gentle, enchanting light. The riddle on the scroll teased, “Seek where the crust is airy and light, and the tomatoes a vivid sight.” Puzzling over these words while munching on a breakfast biscuit, Cooper read them aloud for perhaps the hundredth time. Suddenly, the air around him shimmered and pulsed, and a portal materialized with a soft hum – an archway through which tantalizing aromas and the murmur of a distant marketplace tumbled. With no hesitation, Cooper leaped through the portal, his faithful camera bouncing on his chest. He emerged with a soft thud onto cobblestones warmed by the morning sun. Amazed plooshies in chef’s hats and aprons bustled around him, kneading dough and dicing what could only be the juiciest tomatoes Cooper had ever laid eyes on. Short Story 3: Cooper’s Culinary Quest Begins Cooper’s slumber was a symphony of sizzling and savory scents. While his body rested under the soft sheets, his mind was alive, churning through dreams of cheese-laden landscapes and rivers of tangy tomato sauce. Throughout the night, the secret pizza recipe from the mysterious message whispered tantalizingly in his ears, promising a taste of uncharted delight. As the first light of morning tickled Cooper’s nose, he stretched and yawned, the dreamscape slowly fading to the background of his cozy room. The scroll, now seemingly ordinary in the daylight, lay beside him. But Cooper could still feel the echo of his nocturnal adventure teasing his taste buds. With a determined heart, Cooper unrolled the scroll once more, poring over the scrawled words that spoke of a pizza so sublime it could have only been conceived in the minds of culinary gods. As he traced the words with his paw, a funny sensation tickled his whiskers, and the room began to glow with a warm, golden light. In the blink of an eye, a swirling portal burst open, turning Cooper’s room into a gateway between worlds. He could smell the mingled fragrances of fresh herbs and spices emanating from the vortex. There was no doubt about it; this was his path to the legendary pizza. Clutching the scroll and with his camera ready, Cooper didn’t hesitate for a second before bounding into the unknown. He was a dog on a mission, and nothing would stop him from discovering the secret recipe and sharing the ultimate pizza with his friends back on Plooshy Island. The portal closed behind him with a soft whoosh, leaving behind only a gentle draft that rustled the curtains in the now quiet room. Cooper’s adventure had officially kicked off, and the stakes were as high as the peaks of Plooshy Island’s tallest palm trees. With the thrill of discovery fueling his journey and his belly rumbling for a taste, Cooper was ready to face the challenges and chase the flavors that awaited him beyond the portal. Short Story 4: Ancient Grains Among Timeless Sands Cooper tumbled out from the swirling portal onto the hot, golden sands of what appeared to be an ancient marketplace. For a moment, he was dazzled by the bright Egyptian sun, and as he looked around, he was astounded by the towering pyramids outlined against the stunning blue sky. Plooshies roamed the market in colorful attire, bartering for goods and spices that filled the air with a symphony of exotic scents. Remembering the riddle about where the crust is airy and light, Cooper ambled through the market stalls, using his keen nose to lead the way. He navigated through mesmerizing arrays of pottery and tapestry, until he came upon an old bakery with an aroma that beckoned him with the promise of ancient secrets. Inside, Cooper met a kindly baker named Ammon, who was masterfully tossing dough with years of practiced ease. Ammon shared age-old tales of Egyptian bread-making, passing down the wisdom of grains that had fed their civilization through countless generations. He spoke of a special wheat, kissed by the desert sun, which made the lightest, fluffiest dough. Cooper, with his unending curiosity, asked to learn, and Ammon obliged, teaching the enthusiastic plooshy the art of bread craft. After hours of learning and laughter, Ammon handed Cooper a sack of the prized flour along with a scroll containing an ancient baking technique. With his first ingredient secured and newfound knowledge to share, Cooper felt a profound connection to the land and its people—the guardians of history’s flavors. As sunset painted the desert in hues of fire, Cooper found himself at the foot of a great pyramid. Drawn by an insatiable explorer’s spirit, he entered its mysterious corridors with his camera at the ready. It was in the heart of the pyramid where his plooshy paws stumbled upon puzzling hieroglyphs that depicted an age-old recipe for a dough whose legend spanned the millennia. Capturing the symbols with his camera, Cooper resolved to bring this ancient piece of culinary wisdom back to his island home. With the evening star guiding him, Cooper stepped through the portal once again, his heart full of gratitude for the land of sun and sand that had enriched his quest with its golden grain. In the boundless desert, Cooper had not only found the key ingredient for his perfect pizza crust but had also unraveled a piece of history, weaving it into the tapestry of his own unfolding adventure. Short Story 4: Cooper and the Flour of the Pharaohs As the portal’s light faded, Cooper found himself standing amidst the hustle and bustle of an Egyptian bazaar, with aromatic spices filling the air and the Great Pyramids towering majestically in the background. The message from the bottle had led him here in search of the first key ingredient for the world’s most incredible pizza – the perfect flour.

[Defendant's Full Name], age [Defendant's Age], was sentenced to [Number of Years] years in state prison by [Court Name], presided by Judge [Judge's Name]. The sentence came after a [Number]-month investigation led by [Investigating Authority, e.g., the local police department or fire marshal's office] in cooperation with electrical safety inspectors and the [Region] Power Company. The investigation began after a series of reports emerged regarding the online sale of these non-compliant and unsafe electrical devices. These male-to-male extension cords are considered highly dangerous because they can cause electrical fires or electrocution. Both plug ends being male means that, when plugged into a live outlet, one end is always live, posing a substantial risk of shock or injury. These cords are also not grounded, which further increases the risk of fire and electrocution. \\"Manufacturing and selling unapproved electrical equipment that blatantly disregards basic safety standards is reckless and endangers public safety,\\" stated [Investigating Authority Spokesperson] during a press conference. \\"The sentencing of Mr. [Defendant's Last Name] should serve as a stark warning to others who may consider disregarding electrical safety regulations.\\" Evidence presented during the trial included the seizure of hundreds of these illegally produced cords, as well as sales records and customer testimonials detailing close calls and injuries related to the product's use. Safety experts provided testimony on the inherent risks and demonstrated the proper standards for extension cords. The defendant, represented by attorney [Defense Attorney's Name], argued that the cords were a \\"niche product\\" and claimed ignorance about the potential dangers. However, the prosecution, led by District Attorney [DA's Name], managed to prove willful negligence and a disregard for public safety that warranted a custodial sentence. The judge ordered that all remaining inventory be destroyed and issued a warning about the dangers of these cords to the public. In addition to the prison term, [Defendant's Last Name] may face fines and will be subject to supervision following release. Consumers who may have purchased or are in possession of a male-to-male extension cord are urged to discontinue its use immediately and dispose of it in accordance with local hazardous materials guidelines. For information on the safe handling and disposal of these items, contact [Local Waste Management Information]. The case has prompted authorities to push for increased consumer education on electrical safety and the potential dangers of using non-compliant electrical devices.

Let's denote the principal (the initial amount of money) by P, the rate of interest per annum by R, and the time (in years) by T. We are told that P = Rs. 20,000, T = 2 years, and the difference between the compound interest and simple interest over this period is Rs. 392. Simple Interest (S.I.) is calculated using the formula: [ S.I. = frac{P times R times T}{100} ] Compound Interest (C.I.) for annual compounding is calculated using the formula: [ C.I. = P left(1 + frac{R}{100}right)^T - P ] The difference between C.I. and S.I. is given as Rs. 392, so: [ C.I. - S.I. = 392 ] Plugging in the S.I. formula and expanding the C.I. formula, we get: [ P left(1 + frac{R}{100}right)^2 - P - left( frac{P times R times T}{100} right) = 392 ] Given P = Rs. 20,000 and T = 2 years, let's substitute those in: [ 20,000 left(1 + frac{R}{100}right)^2 - 20,000 - left( frac{20,000 times R times 2}{100} right) = 392 ] [ 20,000 left( left(1 + frac{R}{100}right)^2 - 1 right) - 400R = 392 ] Let's split the compound interest part into an expanded form, considering that (1 + R/100)^2 is (1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2): [ 20,000 left(2frac{R}{100} + left(frac{R}{100}right)^2 right) - 400R = 392 ] [ 20,000 times left( frac{2R}{100} + frac{R^2}{10000} right) - 400R = 392 ] [ 400R + 2R^2 - 400R = 392 ] Notice that the \\"400R\\" terms on the left-hand side cancel each other out, so we are left with: [ 2R^2 = 392 ] Now divide both sides by 2 to solve for R^2: [ R^2 = frac{392}{2} ] [ R^2 = 196 ] Taking the square root of both sides to find R: [ R = sqrt{196} ] [ R = 14 ] Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 14%."},{"prompt":"A group of workers was put on a job.

Had no worker been withdrawn at any stage, the group would have finished the job in 55% of the time. How many workers were there in the group?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of workers by W and the total amount of work by A. Let's also assume that each worker does an equal amount of work each day, which we'll call one unit of work per day for simplicity. Therefore, if all W workers worked together without any being withdrawn, they would finish the job in T days. According to the problem, if no worker had been withdrawn at any stage, the group would have finished the job in 55% of the time. That leads to the following equation: [ T = frac{55}{100} times (W times T) ] Now, let's look at the way the work was actually done: On the 1st day, all W workers worked together, completing W units of the total work A. On the 2nd day, W - 1 workers worked, completing W - 1 units of work. On the 3rd day, W - 2 workers worked, completing W - 2 units of work. ... On the W-1st day, 2 workers worked, completing 2 units of work. On the Wth (last) day, only 1 worker worked, completing 1 unit of work. So the total amount of work A done is the sum of the arithmetic series: [ A = W + (W - 1) + (W - 2) + dots + 2 + 1 ] This is an arithmetic series with W terms, and the sum of the first N natural numbers is given by the formula: [ text{Sum} = frac{N times (N + 1)}{2} ] In this case, N = W, so the total work A is: [ A = frac{W times (W + 1)}{2} ] From the initial information we have: [ T = frac{55}{100} W times T ] This is because if W workers worked for T days, they would have finished the job in that time. But since they actually would have finished it in 55% of that time, we have: [ W times T = frac{W times (W + 1)}{2} ] [ 100T = 55W ] [ 2T = 55 ] Notice that 100T represents 100% of the time and 55% of this time is when no worker was withdrawn. From this, we see that the total amount of work is equal to the work that W workers would have done in 55% of the time. Now let's substitute 2T with 55 in the equation: [ W times 55 = frac{W times (W + 1)}{2} ] Now we need to solve the above equation for W. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: [ 2 times W times 55 = W times (W + 1) ] [ 110W = W^2 + W ] Now move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: [ W^2 + W - 110W = 0 ] [ W^2 - 109W = 0 ] This equation says that W(W - 109) = 0, which gives two possible solutions for W: either W = 0, which wouldn't make sense in this context, or W = 109. So there were 109 workers in the group."},{"prompt":"A group of workers was put on a job. From the second day onwards, one worker was withdrawn each day. The job was finished when the last worker was withdrawn. Had no worker been withdrawn at any stage, the group would have finished the job in 55% of the time. How many workers were there in the group?","completion":"Let's denote the number of workers as W and the amount of time it takes for the job to be completed when no workers are withdrawn as T. This means that the actual time taken to complete the job, given one worker was withdrawn each day until the last day, is 1/T. The work done by any worker on any day is the same, and we can call this amount of work one \\"work unit.\\" So, if W workers were to complete the job in T days without being withdrawn, they would complete W*T work units in that time. Since the job was actually completed in a time greater than T, with one worker being withdrawn each day, the total work done is: First day: W work units (because all W workers were present) Second day: (W-1) work units (because one worker was withdrawn) Third day: (W-2) work units ... (W - (W - 1)) work units on the W-th day (because (W-1) workers were withdrawn over the previous days, leaving just 1 worker) The sum of this arithmetic series (the total work done) is: Work done = W + (W-1) + (W-2) + ... + 3 + 2 + 1 This sum is equal to (W * (W + 1)) / 2 because it is the sum of the first W natural numbers. However, we also know that the job would have been finished in 55% of the time with all workers working throughout, which we can express as (0.55 * T). Because they work W times faster when all workers are present, this means the job requires W * (0.55 * T) work units. Therefore, we have: (W * (W + 1)) / 2 = W * (0.55 * T) We need to find W given that (W * (W + 1)) / 2 is equal to W times 55% of T. Since T is the time for W workers to complete the job, then T is equal to the total work (Work done) divided by the work rate (W), i.e., T = (W * (W + 1)) / (2 * W). Plugging T back into the equation: (W * (W + 1)) / 2 = W * (0.55 * ((W * (W + 1)) / (2 * W))) Simplify by canceling out W on both sides of the equation: (W + 1) / 2 = 0.55 * ((W + 1) / 2) This equation suggests that both sides are equal, but it doesn't seem correct because the number of workers must make a difference. This indicates there might be a mistake because both sides are independent of W, which cannot be true. Let's revise the thought process. We want to find a relationship between the work done normally (in T days by all workers) and the work done when one worker is withdrawn each day (which takes more than T days). Since we're told that had no worker been withdrawn, the group would have finished the job in 55% of the time it actually took, we get the following equation based on the work done (assuming one work unit per worker per day): W * (0.55 * T) = (W * (W + 1)) / 2 Here, T is the actual time taken with workers being withdrawn each day (which would be W days according to the given setup), and 0.55 * T is the time it would have taken if no workers were withdrawn. Simplify and solve for W: W * (0.55 * W) = (W * (W + 1)) / 2 Solve for W^2: 0.55 * W^2 = (W^2 + W) / 2 Multiply by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 1.1 * W^2 = W^2 + W Subtract W^2 from both sides: 0.1 * W^2 = W Divide by 0.1: W^2 = 10 * W We can see that W = 10 because that is the only sensible whole number solution to this equation (W cannot be 0 since there is a group of workers).

Let’s define the work rates based on the time they individually need to complete the work: - Abbot can do the work in 10 days, so Abbot's work rate is 1/10 of the work per day. - Bill can do the work in 20 days, so Bill's work rate is 1/20 of the work per day. - Clinton's completion time is not properly provided in the text, so I will assume there is a mistake and use a placeholder \\"X days\\" for Clinton's completion time. Clinton's work rate is then 1/X of the work per day. They work in the following sequence: Abbot on the first day, Bill on the second day, Clinton on the third day, and then the cycle repeats. We can consider what fraction of the work is completed after each full cycle of 3 days: - On the first day, Abbot completes 1/10 of the work. - On the second day, Bill completes 1/20 of the work. - On the third day, Clinton completes 1/X of the work. Adding these fractions gives us the total work done in one cycle of three days: [ frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{X} = frac{2}{20} + frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{X} = frac{3}{20} + frac{1}{X} ] We want to find out how many such cycles it will take to complete the whole work (which is represented by the number 1). Let’s call the number of cycles needed C. The equation is: [ C cdot left(frac{3}{20} + frac{1}{X}right) = 1 ] Without knowing the value of X (Clinton's rate), we cannot solve for C. However, once we know X, we can solve this equation for the number of cycles C, and since each cycle comprises 3 days, the total time taken would be: [ T = 3 cdot C ] In this problem, the work rates per day are critical, but Clinton's work rate is undefined.

Now we want to find out how many such cycles it will take to complete the entire work. Let's call the number of full cycles as C. Since every three days 7/40 of the work is done, we can use this equation: [ C cdot frac{7}{40} + text{final partial day's work} = 1 ] Where C must be an integer because they complete full cycles, and the final part of the equation ensures that if the job is not finished by the end of the last full cycle, whoever is up next in the rotation finishes the remaining part of the job. To find the number of full cycles, we can start by finding the largest multiple of 7/40 that is less than or equal to 1. We do this by taking the floor of 40/7, which gives the maximum C value without exceeding 1: [ C = leftlfloor frac{40}{7} rightrfloor = 5 ] Now we calculate the work done after 5 full cycles: [ 5 cdot frac{7}{40} = frac{35}{40} ] After 5 cycles (5 x 3 = 15 days), they have completed 35/40 (or 7/8) of the work. To determine how much work is left: [ 1 - frac{35}{40} = frac{40}{40} - frac{35}{40} = frac{5}{40} = frac{1}{8} ] For the remaining 1/8 of the work, they will begin a new cycle with Abbot working on the first day. Since Abbot's work rate is 1/10, which is more than 1/8, he will finish the remaining work in less than a day. To find exactly how much time Abbot will need to finish the remaining work, we calculate the fraction of a day: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Remaining work}}{text{Abbot's work rate}} = frac{1/8}{1/10} = frac{1}{8} cdot frac{10}{1} = frac{10}{8} = frac{5}{4} ] So Abbot needs 5/4 or 1.25 days to finish the remaining work. Therefore, the total time taken to complete the work fully is the sum of the full cycles and the time for the last part: [ 15 text{ days} (for 5 cycles of 3 days each) + 1.25 text{ days} = 16.25 text{ days} ] So it will take 16.25 days to complete the work fully, with Abbot finishing the last fraction of the work on the 16th day."},{"prompt":"There are three Taps A, B and C in a tank They can fill the tank in 10 hrs, 20 hrs and 25 hrs respectively.

[ text{Total work per hour} = frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{25} = frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{25} ] Get a common denominator to add these fractions together (the least common multiple of 10, 20, and 25 is 100): [ text{Total work per hour} = frac{10}{100} + frac{5}{100} + frac{4}{100} = frac{19}{100} ] - In the first two hours, the three taps together fill: [ 2 times frac{19}{100} = frac{38}{100} text{ of the tank} ] After 2 hours, Tap C is closed, so for the next 2 hours, only Taps A and B are running: - Taps A and B's combined work rate is: [ frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{20} = frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{20} ] Again, finding a common denominator (20): [ frac{2}{20} + frac{1}{20} = frac{3}{20} ] - In the next 2 hours (hours 3 and 4), Taps A and B together fill: [ 2 times frac{3}{20} = frac{3}{10} text{ of the tank} ] After the 4th hour, Tap B is also closed, and Tap A continues alone: So far, Taps A, B, and C together have filled: [ frac{38}{100} + frac{3}{10} = frac{38}{100} + frac{30}{100} = frac{68}{100} text{ or } frac{17}{25} text{ of the tank} ] We know the entire tank is filled by Tap A eventually, which means Tap A alone fills the remaining part of the tank after 4 hours: - The remaining part of the tank to be filled by Tap A is: [ 1 - frac{68}{100} = frac{32}{100} text{ or } frac{8}{25} text{ of the tank} ] Tap A's work rate is 1/10 of the tank per hour, so it would take Tap A an additional: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Remaining work}}{text{Tap A's work rate}} = frac{8}{25} div frac{1}{10} = frac{8}{25} times 10 = frac{8 times 10}{25} = frac{32}{25} ] [ text{Time} = frac{32}{25} text{ hours} ] This tells us Tap A takes ( frac{32}{25} ) hours to fill the ( frac{8}{25} ) of the tank. To find the percentage of the tank that Tap A fills alone, we use the work it did alone over the total: [ text{Percentage filled by Tap A alone} = frac{text{Work done by Tap A alone}}{text{Total work}} times 100% ] [ text{Percentage filled by Tap A alone} = frac{8}{25} times 100% ] [ text{Percentage filled by Tap A alone} = frac{32}{100} times 100% ] [ text{Percentage filled by Tap A alone} = 32% ] So, 32% of the work was done by Tap A by itself."},{"prompt":"Two taps are running continuously to fill a tank The 1st tap could have filled it in 5 hours by itself and second one by itself could have filled it in 20 hours. But the operator failed to realise that there was a leak in the tank from the beginning which caused a delay of one hour in the filling of the tank Find the time in which the leak would empty a filled tank.","completion":"Let's first determine the rates at which the taps fill the tank, and then we can find out the rate at which the leak empties it. Tap 1 can fill the tank by itself in 5 hours, so its rate is 1/5 of the tank per hour. Tap 2 can fill the tank by itself in 20 hours, so its rate is 1/20 of the tank per hour. Together, without the leak, the rate at which the two taps fill the tank would be the sum of their rates: [ text{Combined rate without leak} = frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{20} ] Finding a common denominator, which is 20: [ text{Combined rate without leak} = frac{4}{20} + frac{1}{20} = frac{5}{20} = frac{1}{4} ] This means the two taps together would fill the tank in 4 hours without any leak. However, it's given that there is a delay of one hour due to the leak. Therefore, the actual time taken to fill the tank with the leak is 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours. Now, let's denote the rate at which the leak empties the tank as L (a fraction of the tank per hour). We can write an equation for the actual scenario where the combined filling rate of the two taps minus the emptying rate of the leak equals the overall rate that corresponds to the tank being filled in 5 hours: [ text{Combined rate with leak} = frac{1}{4} - L = frac{1}{5} ] Solving for L: [ L = frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{5} ] To find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20: [ L = frac{5}{20} - frac{4}{20} = frac{1}{20} ] This means the leak empties 1/20th of the tank per hour. To find the time it would take for the leak to empty the entire tank, we take the reciprocal of the leak's rate (since L represents the part of the tank that leaks out every hour): [ text{Time to empty} = frac{1}{L} = frac{1}{ frac{1}{20}} = 20 text{ hours} ] So, the leak would empty the tank in 20 hours."},{"prompt":"In a fort there was sufficient food for 200 soldiers for 31 days. After 27 days 120 soldiers left the fort. For how many extra days will the rest of the food last for the remaining soldiers?","completion":"To determine how many extra days the remaining food will last for the rest of the soldiers, we'll need to calculate how much food is consumed each day and then find out how much food is left after 27 days. Let's set up the initial information: - There is enough food in the fort for 200 soldiers for 31 days. Now let's find out how much food is consumed each day: - Total food available at the start = Food required for 200 soldiers for 31 days - Daily food consumed = Food required for 200 soldiers for 1 day After 27 days, we calculate the remaining food: - Food consumed in 27 days = Food required for 200 soldiers for 27 days - Remaining food after 27 days = Total food available - Food consumed in 27 days Let's calculate the food consumed per day and total food: - Food consumed by each soldier per day = 1 unit (for simplicity, we'll assume each soldier consumes 1 unit of food per day) - Total food available = 200 soldiers * 31 days = 6200 units Food consumed in 27 days: - Food consumed in 27 days = 200 soldiers * 27 days = 5400 units Remaining food after 27 days: - Remaining food = 6200 units - 5400 units = 800 units Now 120 soldiers leave, and we have 80 soldiers remaining: - The daily consumption rate for 80 soldiers is 80 units (since each soldier consumes 1 unit of food per day.) Now we calculate for how many days the remaining 800 units of food will last for 80 soldiers: - Number of days food will last for 80 soldiers = Remaining food / Daily consumption rate for 80 soldiers - Number of days = 800 units / 80 soldiers = 10 days Originally, there was sufficient food to last for 31 days. The food would now last for 10 more days for the remaining 80 soldiers, which would have been days 32 to 41, inclusive. So for the remaining soldiers, the food will last for an extra 10 days beyond the original 31 days."},{"prompt":"does software get calculated into gd per capita or export value?","completion":"Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's total GDP by its population, providing an average economic output per person. When it comes to software, whether or not it gets calculated into GDP per capita depends on how the software is produced and distributed: 1. **Domestically Produced Software**: If the software is produced within the country and sold on the market, the value of this software is included in the GDP calculation. The creation of software involves labor and capital, which are part of the production process, and so its value is added to the GDP as part of the economic activity within the nation. 2. **Exported Software**: If the software is produced domestically and then exported, the value of these exports is included in the country's GDP. Exports contribute to GDP because they are a form of economic output that is sold internationally. This inflow of money from abroad is a positive addition to the nation's economy. 3. **Imported Software**: Conversely, software that is imported does not directly contribute to the importing country's GDP; instead, it contributes to the GDP of the country where it was produced. However, the distribution and retail of imported software contribute to GDP as these are economic activities taking place within the country. In terms of GDP per capita specifically, the inclusion of software in this calculation would not be direct; rather, it is the aggregate value of all goods and services, including software, that is considered when determining GDP. The per capita figure is simply an average that gives a general sense of individual economic output by dividing the total GDP by the population. So, if the software industry is a significant part of a country's economy, it can have a noticeable impact on GDP per capita. For export value, software that is exported is indeed calculated into the total value of a country's exports. This value is often accounted for in trade statistics, and the export of software can be an important part of a country's trade balance and its standing in the global economy."},{"prompt":"how does it get calculated in? does it get calculated as the revenue the product brings in?","completion":"In national accounts, the way software gets calculated into the GDP can vary based on how the software is classified and how it is being sold or used. Here are the general methods of inclusion: 1. **Direct Sales of Software**: When software is sold directly to consumers or businesses, its value is included in GDP based on the revenue it generates. This means the sale price paid by the purchaser, less any taxes or additional fees that do not go to the producer. This revenue is included in the GDP under personal or business consumption expenditures. 2. **Software Exports**: For software that is exported, the revenue from sales to foreign buyers is included under the exports section of the GDP. The export value represents income to the domestic economy from outside its borders. 3. **Software Development for Internal Use**: When a company develops software for its own use (for example, a proprietary inventory management system), the investment in creating this software is also counted in GDP. This is included as capital investment, very much like investment in physical capital (buildings, machinery, etc.). It's assessed not on the revenue it brings in, but on the costs associated with its development, including labor, overheads, and other resources used. 4. **Software in Bundled Products/Services**: When software is sold as part of a bundled product or service (e.g., an operating system pre-installed on a new computer), its value is typically calculated as part of the overall value of the product or service. 5. **Subscription and Licensing**: In the case of subscriptions or licensing fees for software, GDP includes the income generated from these ongoing payments. For subscription-based or software-as-a-service (SaaS) models, the regular payments are counted as they are received. 6. **Secondary Market Transactions**: For transactions in the secondary market, where used software licenses are sold, only the service fees or commissions earned by the facilitating platform or company might be included in GDP since the original value of the software has already been accounted for when it was first sold as new. 7. **Software Upgrades and Updates**: Minor updates might not distinctly influence GDP as they are often provided for free or as part of a subscription. However, major upgrades that are sold as new products or for additional fees will contribute to GDP as additional economic activity. In principle, the idea behind incorporating software into GDP is not just the revenue it brings in but the value added to the economy through its production and sale, including wages paid to workers, profits earned by firms, and taxes collected by the government related to that software. This method aligns with how other goods and services are treated in the calculation of GDP."},{"prompt":"Write a fictional Disney Channel EMEA blog post for January 2024, where Big City Greens loses 3 slots to some older Disney Channel cartoons Miraculous loses 1 slot to The Owl House","completion":"**Disney Channel EMEA Blog Post - January 2024: Schedule Shake-Up with Retro Returns!** Hello Disney Dynamos, Happy New Year!

There's one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily's powers, and if she can't, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it'd be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls.","completion":"Very well, let's embark on this fantastical journey together. Sapphire, with a heart full of nostalgia and determination, returns to the weathered, comforting walls of the orphanage where she spent her own formative years. The headmistress, a portly, kind woman with lines of age and wisdom etched into her face, greets Sapphire with a warm embrace. Sapphire is quickly brought up to speed about the peculiar situation with young Lily. Sapphire, feeling a mix of concern and curiosity, agrees to help monitor the exceptional toddler. As her first day rolls around, Sapphire's attentiveness to Lily is imperative to prevent any accidental age regression among the children. Let’s start with Sapphire trying to understand Lily's behavior and setting some boundaries.

Tell me the result of your roll and we’ll continue from there."},{"prompt":"9","completion":"With a roll of 9, Sapphire's initial efforts to bond with Lily and establish clear boundaries yield modest results. She manages to get Lily's attention and even make her laugh a couple of times, but the little girl remains unpredictable and partially unaware of the gravity of her unique condition. As the day progresses, Lily becomes increasingly restless, and it becomes apparent that keeping her entertained and under supervision will be a challenging task for Sapphire. The older children watch with a mix of curiosity and concern, clearly remembering the incident with the toddlers. Now, Sapphire must attempt to redirect Lily's energies into a harmless activity, perhaps engaging her with a puzzle or a storybook.

She gathers Lily and a few other children around, spinning a tale of adventurous heroes and magical creatures, her voice rising and falling with the rhythm of the narrative. Lily seems taken by the story, her eyes wide with wonder, but she's fidgety, occasionally reaching out towards the other children. Sapphire must catch these little hands each time, gently but firmly reminding her to listen without touching. Sapphire's moderate success keeps the situation under control for the moment, but the restraint she must consistently enforce is both physically and mentally taxing. To continue, Sapphire needs to ensure that Lily takes her afternoon nap, which could prove crucial for preventing her powers from activating unintentionally due to tiredness or crankiness.

Lily, not one to settle down easily, resists with the stubbornness of a child who does not understand the need for rest. Her resistance is palpable—and with it, the danger of her powers slipping out. Sapphire tries rocking Lily, singing lullabies, and even laying down next to her, hoping her own calm presence will lull the child to sleep. Yet, Lily seems more interested in playing with Sapphire's hair and giggling than closing her eyes. As the situation becomes more fraught, there's a surge of energy from Lily, and Sapphire feels a wave of dizziness. It seems Lily's powers are manifesting due to her agitation. At this critical juncture, Sapphire must remain collected and redirect Lily’s attention from her antics to trying to rest. This would be a good time to roll the d20 to see if Sapphire can resist the wave of regression energy emanating from Lily.

However, the energy has not dissipated entirely, leaving the room charged with the potential for accidental age regression. Recognizing the risk, Sapphire quickly guides Lily away from the other children, using her body as a shield between Lily and her peers. Now, Sapphire must exert her will to calm Lily and dissipate the lingering magical energy. It's a delicate moment that requires patience and gentle persuasion. Sapphire tries to soothe Lily with a soft, melodic song that the headmistress used to sing to them when they were younger.

Her innate powers, tied so closely to her emotions, start to flicker around her like static electricity, seeking an outlet. Sapphire, feeling the first hints of the magic tugging at the edges of her own age, fights to keep her focus, but it's evident that she is fighting a losing battle. Let's roll the d20 again to determine the extent of Sapphire's regression—if she regresses at all—and how much Lily inadvertently ages as a result. Roll the die and let me know the outcome."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"With an unfortunate roll of 1, Sapphire is engulfed by the full force of Lily's unrestrained powers. As the magical energy swirls around her, she feels a profound and disconcerting sensation, as if time itself is winding backwards around her frame. You can sense Sapphire's determination and poise slipping away as she regresses in age. The other children watch in shock, unsure of what's happening to their beloved caretaker and friend. Let's determine the consequences of this critical roll. Given the low result, Sapphire will regress significantly. The degree of regression will be equivalent to rolling a d6 to see how many years she loses. Additionally, Lily will absorb those years, growing older by the same amount. Roll a d6 now to find out how many years Sapphire regresses, and how much older Lily becomes in response. Please share the result with me."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"With the roll of 4 on the d6, Sapphire experiences an immediate regression, losing four years of her life to the magical influence of Lily's uncontrolled powers. The seventeen-year-old young woman rapidly transforms, shrinking in stature and features, until she stands before the shocked children as a thirteen-year-old girl. Lily, on the other hand, absorbs the years lost by Sapphire. The three-year-old little girl matures before everyone's eyes, growing and developing into a child of seven, precariously close to the crucial age of eight when she would become fully aware of her powers. With Sapphire now appearing visibly younger and less authoritative, the other children's reactions vary from amazement to concern—after all, Sapphire was their caretaker, and she's suddenly become one of their peers. The balance of power has shifted, and there's an uneasy murmuring among the orphans as they try to understand the implications. The headmistress, sensing the disturbance, will likely come investigate soon. Sapphire, still retaining her memories and experiences despite her younger appearance, must rapidly adapt to her new reality and seek to prevent Lily from regressing anyone further or reaching the critical point of self-awareness. This task is now more daunting than ever given her diminished physical age and loss of authority. Sapphire needs to get help, convince the headmistress and the other orphans that she's still capable of handling the situation, and protect everyone from further age regression—all while dealing with the confusion of her own sudden change. Would you like to roll to determine whether Sapphire can convince the headmistress of her competency despite her younger appearance, or should we focus on her efforts to safeguard the children from Lily? Please decide the next course of action and proceed with the corresponding roll."},{"prompt":"roll to convince the headmistress","completion":"Alright, let's see if Sapphire, in her suddenly younger form, can successfully convince the headmistress that she is still capable and trustworthy enough to handle the situation and help with Lily.

Please roll the die and tell me the outcome."},{"prompt":"12","completion":"With a roll of 12, Sapphire has a moderate chance of convincing the headmistress. Her case is neither particularly strong nor weak, but given the extraordinary circumstances and her previously established trust with the headmistress, she is given the benefit of the doubt. The headmistress, upon arriving and witnessing the young Sapphire, is initially taken aback, struggling to reconcile the teenager she once knew with the child standing before her. However, she quickly recognizes Sapphire's eyes — still filled with determination and a touch of the maturity that isn't typical for her apparent age. Sapphire pleads her case, explaining that she retains all her memories and the experiences she's gained over the years. She passionately insists that she can still look after Lily and the other children, perhaps even better now that she physically fits in more with the orphans. After a moment of thoughtful consideration, the headmistress tentatively agrees to let Sapphire continue her duties, keeping a close eye on the dynamic between her and the children. However, she makes it clear that this is a provisional arrangement, and she expects Sapphire to demonstrate that she can manage the situation, especially with Lily. Sapphire is now faced with the double challenge of re-establishing her authority among the children and preventing any further age regression incidents. She must use all her wit and knowledge to navigate this delicate situation.

Let me know the result of your roll."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"With a roll of 4, Sapphire finds that readjusting her stance among the children is far more difficult than she had hoped. The children, seeing her now as a peer, struggle to reconcile her younger appearance with her previous position of authority. Some of the older children, specifically those close to Sapphire's regressed age, begin to question her instructions and challenge her directives. Whispers and giggles spread across the room as some of the children jokingly call Sapphire by her first name without any formalities, a clear sign of diminished respect. Sapphire tries to assert herself, but the usual assertiveness in her voice now comes across as less commanding, her stature less imposing. The playful atmosphere, while good-natured, undermines Sapphire's attempts to maintain order, and her role as a caretaker begins to wane as she is increasingly seen as just another member of the orphanage. Sapphire will need to find a new way to manage the children and regain their respect, perhaps through cleverness, leveraging their trust, or finding a new kind of authority that doesn't rely on age or appearance. Would Sapphire like to attempt a new strategy to regain her authority, or should we now concentrate on controlling Lily's powers to prevent the situation from escalating? Please choose the next action and we'll proceed accordingly."},{"prompt":"concentrate on controlling Lily's powers","completion":"Understood. Sapphire, aware that her authority has been compromised, knows that the safety of the children, especially in relation to Lily's unpredictable powers, is the top priority. She decides to put her focus on developing a strategy that could help contain or control Lily's abilities before another incident occurs. With her own recent age regression still vivid in her mind, Sapphire considers using her newfound closeness in age to relate to Lily on a more personal level, hoping to guide the young girl with empathy rather than authority. Let's roll a d20 to see how effective Sapphire is in connecting with Lily and managing her powers. Roll when you're ready and share the outcome with me."},{"prompt":"11","completion":"With a roll of 11, Sapphire finds some moderate success in connecting with Lily. She sits down with the young girl, now almost her own age, and attempts to communicate the importance of being careful. Lily, though more mature and cognizant than before her sudden aging, is still adapting to her quick development and doesn't fully grasp the extent of her abilities. Sapphire uses simple terms and gentle guidance, trying to explain that their \\"special game\\" is something they can only play at certain times. She does her best to establish a secret pact with Lily, suggesting that they should work together to keep the other children safe. Lily nods, seemingly understanding, but there's a hint of mischief in her eyes—a remnant of her toddler's impulsiveness combined with her new, older self's curiosity and growing self-awareness. It's evident that while Sapphire has made some headway with Lily, the situation remains tenuous. Sapphire knows that she will need to remain vigilant and perhaps seek out magical advice or assistance to find a more lasting solution to Lily's powerful abilities. Consistent monitoring and creative distraction will be key to preventing further incidents. Would you like to explore magical solutions available to Sapphire, or should we roll to see how well Sapphire can implement a monitoring system to ensure Lily's powers are kept in check throughout the day? Please decide the next course of action and we'll continue the story."},{"prompt":"roll to see how well Sapphire can implement a monitoring system to ensure Lily’s powers are kept in check","completion":"Let's see how effectively Sapphire can put together a system to monitor Lily and ensure her powers are kept under control throughout the day. Roll a d20 to determine the success of Sapphire's efforts. A high roll would suggest a well-implemented system that helps safeguard the orphanage, while a low roll may imply further challenges ahead. Roll the die and let me know the result."},{"prompt":"8","completion":"With a roll of 8, Sapphire manages to set up a rudimentary but somewhat functional monitoring system. Realizing that she cannot watch Lily every moment by herself, she enlists the help of some of the older, more responsible children, explaining the situation in terms they can understand. They agree to take shifts playing with Lily, keeping her occupied and away from the younger children who are most at risk. While the system is in place, it's not without its flaws. The older children are not always attentive, and sometimes they get absorbed in their own activities, forgetting to keep a keen eye on Lily. Sapphire does her best to fill in the gaps, but there are moments when Lily is left unsupervised for short periods. So far, no further incidents of age regression have occurred, but the constant vigilance required is taxing on Sapphire and her makeshift team of helpers. She knows that this solution is only temporary and that she will need to come up with a long-term plan to manage Lily's powers, especially as Lily continues to grow and her understanding of her powers evolves. For now, the orphanage operates in a state of cautious normalcy, with everyone more or less aware that the whims of a child hold the key to an unpredictable magic. As the headmistress watches the operation from the sidelines, she acknowledges Sapphire's efforts and begins considering seeking outside aid—perhaps a wizard or healer knowledgeable in such rare magical anomalies. Would you like Sapphire to continue refining her monitoring system, or shall we see if they decide to seek external magical assistance to help with Lily's powers? Decide the next step and we will proceed with the narrative."},{"prompt":"continue refining the monitoring system","completion":"Sapphire, understanding the weight of her responsibility, doubles her efforts to refine the monitoring system she has put in place. She recognizes that the growing curiosity and awareness Lily is displaying about her own abilities could lead to challenges that must be met with a cohesive and vigilant approach. To enhance her strategy, Sapphire decides to set clear rules and create a structured schedule with designated play areas, ensuring Lily is always within sight of a responsible overseer. She focuses on strengthening the older children's understanding of the importance of their roles and even arranges small rewards for those who are particularly attentive. Time for another d20 roll to see how well Sapphire's renewed efforts to improve the system work out. A high roll will indicate a successful refinement, while a low roll might show that there's still much room for improvement. Please roll the die and share the result with me."},{"prompt":"3","completion":"With a roll of 3, Sapphire encounters significant challenges while trying to improve the monitoring system. Her intentions are sound, and her plans are well-thought-out, but execution proves difficult. The older children are less cooperative than she had hoped, feeling the burden of responsibility resting heavily on their young shoulders. Their attention wanders, and some even begin to neglect their duties in favor of play or chores they deem more important. Furthermore, Lily is becoming increasingly wilful and curious about the world around her, a natural consequence of her accelerated growth. This curiosity often leads her to wander off or test the limits of what she's been told, which makes monitoring even more challenging. Additionally, the younger orphans sense the tension in the air. They don't fully understand what's happening, but they pick up on the increased stress levels among the older kids and Sapphire, and this leads to a general sense of unrest and discord within the orphanage. Sapphire realizes that despite her greatest efforts, this situation calls for more than vigilance and planning—it demands a solution that addresses the root of the problem: Lily's powers. Perhaps the time has come to seek advice from someone with more experience in magical matters, such as a mage or an enchanter from the nearby town. Regrouping, Sapphire remains determined not to give up. She knows she must be resourceful and consider reaching out beyond the walls of the orphanage for help. Would you like Sapphire to attempt another refining approach to the system, or should we now turn to the prospect of seeking external magical assistance for a more permanent resolution? Please choose the next step and we'll continue from there."},{"prompt":"Sapphire witnesses Lily arguing with other kids and worries it'll trigger her powers","completion":"Understanding the precarious balance of the situation, Sapphire springs into action as she sees Lily entering into an argument with a group of other children. The potential for Lily's emotional state to escalate and trigger her powers is something Sapphire knows she cannot ignore. In a flash of insight, Sapphire decides that a direct approach might not be best; she needs to defuse the situation subtly, reminding the children of their camaraderie and shifting the focus away from conflict. Let's roll a d20 to determine how successful Sapphire is at calming the situation before Lily's powers are unleashed. A high roll could signify that Sapphire is able to swiftly and effectively de-escalate the argument, while a lower roll might indicate that her intervention doesn't go as smoothly as hoped. Please roll the die and tell me the result."},{"prompt":"7","completion":"With a roll of 7, Sapphire's intervention is met with only limited success. She quickly steps in, using all her persuasive abilities to calm the rising tempers, trying to remind the children of the importance of getting along and supporting each other. Her words resonate with some of the children, who begin to step back and reassess the situation. Unfortunately, not all are swayed by her pleas; the argument has grown heated, and some of the children are too caught up in their feelings to listen. Lily, in particular, seems to be getting more upset by the second, her emotions flaring and her powers flickering at her fingertips. Sapphire must now act quickly to prevent an outbreak of Lily's powers before she can inadvertently affect herself or the other children. Understanding the immediate need for a distraction, Sapphire diverts her focus to Lily, attempting to engage her in a one-on-one conversation to redirect her attention from the argument. Time for another roll of the d20 to see if Sapphire can successfully distract Lily with a personal conversation and contain her powers before they spiral out of control. Roll the die and inform me of the result."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"With an unfortunate roll of 1, Sapphire's attempt to engage Lily in a one-on-one conversation does not go as planned. In her already flustered state, Lily perceives Sapphire’s intervention as another form of targeting, which only exacerbates the young girl’s agitation. Feeling cornered and misunderstood, Lily's emotional distress hits a peak, and her uncontrolled magical energy pulses outwards. Sapphire is caught off guard by the sudden intensity of the outburst, and the consequences are immediate and significant. We need to roll a d6 to determine the extent of Sapphire's regression—and by how many years she gets younger—as well as the corresponding growth in Lily’s age. Please roll the d6 now and share the result with me."},{"prompt":"2","completion":"With a roll of 2 on the d6, Sapphire feels a rippling wave of energy pass through her, causing her to regress by two years. The thirteen-year-old Sapphire, now even smaller and younger in appearance, becomes an eleven-year-old girl. Her clothes hang looser on her shrunken frame, and her voice, when she speaks, carries the unmistakable pitch of a child’s. On the other side of this unintended exchange, Lily rapidly matures by the same two years, her body and mind accelerating to that of a nine-year-old. Now, at this pivotal age, Lily becomes acutely aware of her unusual ability. This sudden self-awareness does not come with control, however, and Lily looks at her own hands—and then at Sapphire—in a mixture of bewilderment and newfound understanding. Recognizing the gravity of what has just happened, the older children who were arguing stop in their tracks, staring at Sapphire and Lily with a mix of guilt and fear. The atmosphere is heavy with uncertainty – the children are unsure of what to do next, and Sapphire's previous authority has diminished even further. Sapphire, still in possession of her memories and a mental age of seventeen, needs to quickly get a handle on her own emotions and the new dynamics in play. This regression makes her task of managing Lily and protecting the other children even more daunting. She must find a way to demonstrate maturity beyond her years and appeal to Lily's newfound awareness to seek her cooperation. As an eleven-year-old, how might Sapphire choose to approach Lily now? Should she attempt to reason with her, seeking collaboration, or try to find the headmistress for help with a child who now may understand the implications of her own power? Decide on Sapphire's next step and we will carry on with the story."},{"prompt":"try to reason with Lily","completion":"Despite the disorienting sensation of regression and the challenges presented by her younger appearance, Sapphire retains her seventeen-year-old mind and memories. She recognizes that reasoning with Lily, now more aware of her powers, is a task that requires a delicate touch and a mature approach. Sapphire gathers her composure and approaches Lily with empathy, understanding that Lily herself must be frightened and confused by the sudden changes and the power she wields. With a calm and even tone, Sapphire begins to speak to Lily, not as a caretaker might to a ward, but as one might speak to an equal who shares a secret. \\"Lily,\\" Sapphire begins, kneeling to be at eye level with the newly aged girl, \\"I know this is all very strange and probably a little scary for you. But I also know that you're a kind and caring person. You didn't mean for this to happen, did you?\\" Sapphire pauses to give Lily a chance to respond, to feel heard and understood. Let's roll a d20 to determine how successful Sapphire is in establishing this connection and reasoning with Lily, to collaboratively work toward keeping everyone safe from the unpredictable magic. Roll the die and let me know the outcome."},{"prompt":"7","completion":"With a roll of 7, Sapphire’s attempt to connect with Lily and establish a mutually understanding conversation is met with partial success. Lily, now having the mind of a nine-year-old, is more capable of complex thought and recognizing the consequences of her actions. She listens to Sapphire's words, and there's a flicker of understanding in her eyes, but also a wariness and a sense of being overwhelmed by her rapidly changing reality. Lily nods slightly in acknowledgment of Sapphire's words, indicating she doesn't mean to cause harm, but the expression on her face suggests that she is still grappling with her emotions and the gravity of her newfound abilities. The connection between them is fragile, and while Lily is not immediately dismissive, there is also no clear indication that she is fully on board with working together yet. Sapphire knows she must tread carefully, building trust with Lily and ensuring she feels supported rather than feared or isolated because of her powers. It will be a delicate process requiring patience, consistency, and perhaps assistance from others who may understand the nature of such magic better than she does. For the moment, the situation seems to have calmed down somewhat, but the need for a more stable and permanent solution is evident. Sapphire must continue her efforts, perhaps reinforcing her approach with more comprehensive plans or seeking help from the headmistress or outside experts. Would you like Sapphire to keep working on building the connection with Lily, or is it time to seek additional help from the headmistress or elsewhere? Let me know what Sapphire should do next."},{"prompt":"build a connection with Lily","completion":"Sapphire understands that maintaining a connection with Lily is critical. Beyond the immediate need to manage her powers, there's also a child who needs guidance and a sense of belonging. Sapphire decides to make the effort to build that connection, hoping that through trust and understanding, Lily will learn to control her powers and perhaps even use them for good one day. Sapphire deals gently with Lily, spending time with her, getting to know her likes and dislikes, and sharing her own experiences. She aims to become not just a caretaker but a friend and ally, giving Lily the emotional support she needs during this confusing time. This period of relationship-building is crucial. Roll a d20 to see how successful Sapphire is in deepening her bond with Lily and guiding her towards the responsible use of her powers. Roll the die and let me know the result."},{"prompt":"5","completion":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire's attempts to forge a strong bond with Lily and guide her towards the responsible use of her powers face significant hurdles. Lily, though initially receptive to Sapphire's presence and conversation, is still a child struggling with complex emotions and unprecedented magical abilities. Her responses to Sapphire's overtures are inconsistent; at times she seems to enjoy the companionship, while at others, she withdraws into herself, confused and perhaps even a little scared of her own potential. The inconsistencies in Lily's behavior make it difficult for Sapphire to maintain steady progress in their relationship. The trust-building is a slow process, marred by setbacks as Lily sometimes acts out, driven by the impulses and moods typical for her apparent age. Though Sapphire doesn't face any more incidents of unintentional regression, the constant concern that one wrong move could trigger Lily's powers is a source of tension. Sapphire remains resolute in her commitment to Lily, but it becomes clear that building a lasting and truly influential connection will take time and would greatly benefit from help or guidance from someone versed in magical abilities and the psychological impact they can have on a young child. As Sapphire considers her next steps, it might be worth reevaluating her approach — seeking assistance and knowledge outside the orphanage or reinforcing the systems she's put in place while she gradually earns Lily's full trust. Would Sapphire continue her efforts with Lily with the understanding that it will be a long-term endeavor, or does she decide to seek external help either from the headmistress or a magic expert? Please decide how Sapphire proceeds."},{"prompt":"Sapphire asks the older kids, some of whom are now older than she is, to help with Lily","completion":"Sapphire, recognizing that the task ahead requires more hands and hearts than hers alone, decides to reach out to the older children for support. While some are now older than she is in appearance, they still remember her original role and the maturity she once displayed. She hopes to appeal to their sense of community and responsibility to protect and guide one of their own. She calls a meeting with the older children, laying out the situation honestly and openly. She talks about the importance of unity and how each and every one of them can help Lily learn, grow, and perhaps eventually control her powers. Sapphire emphasizes that they are not just preventing harm — they are helping a friend in need. Let's roll a d20 to see how receptive the older children are to Sapphire's proposal and whether they are willing to step up and assist her in managing and mentoring Lily. Please roll the die and inform me of the result."},{"prompt":"2","completion":"With a roll of 2, Sapphire's appeal to the older children does not go as she had hoped. The age regression she experienced has greatly affected her standing with the other orphans, and although they remember her as an older caretaker, her current younger appearance makes it difficult for them to take her seriously. The older kids, now looking down at a younger Sapphire, find it hard to reconcile her pleas for help with what they perceive as a reversal of roles. Some of the children are dismissive, others are skeptical, and a few might even feel a bit resentful at the idea of taking on such a significant responsibility when it was Sapphire who was supposed to be in charge originally. The meeting ends with murmurs and half-hearted commitments, leaving Sapphire with a clear understanding that she cannot rely solely on the older children to maintain control over the situation. They may be willing to keep an eye on Lily here and there, but they lack the commitment and sense of urgency necessary to create a stable and supportive environment for managing her powers. Faced with this setback, Sapphire realizes she needs to reassess her strategy. She might need to focus even more on directly connecting with Lily, possibly trying alternative approaches, or she may have to take the considerable step of seeking outside help despite the inherent risk of exposing Lily's abilities to those beyond the orphanage walls. Does Sapphire persist in trying to work things out within the orphanage, or does she decide it's time to seek external assistance, be it the headmistress's advice or the knowledge of a magic expert? Please choose what Sapphire does next."},{"prompt":"try to connect with Lily","completion":"Sapphire faces a reality where help from the older children is not forthcoming, and she must rely on her own resourcefulness to manage Lily's powers. She decides that attempting to connect with Lily on a deeper level may be the key to preventing further mishaps. It's pivotal for Sapphire to strengthen her bond with Lily, aim to understand Lily's perspective, and guide her use of power through empathy and patience rather than through authority, which she no longer possesses in the eyes of the other children. To build this connection, Sapphire plans regular one-on-one sessions with Lily, involving activities they both enjoy. She listens to Lily's concerns, shares her own stories, and gently nudges her towards recognizing when she might be getting upset and how to seek help in those moments. Let's roll a d20 to see how effective Sapphire's individual efforts are in fostering a trusting and influential relationship with Lily, one that could lead to Lily managing her powers responsibly. Roll the die and inform me of the outcome."},{"prompt":"1","completion":"With an unfortunate roll of 1, Sapphire's earnest attempts to create a meaningful connection with Lily hit a substantial roadblock. Despite her genuine approach and her willingness to listen and be present for Lily, Sapphire's endeavors are met with unforeseen complications. Lily's growing self-awareness and the profound instability of her powers prove to be a volatile mix. The pressure of the situation, along with Lily's emotional unpredictability, lead to a troubling incident. Amid one of their sessions, Lily becomes increasingly agitated; her emotions spike, and before Sapphire can offer solace, Lily's powers react wildly. Sapphire is caught in the magical backlash. For the consequences of this critical low roll, we will need to use a d6 to determine the degree of Sapphire's regression and the simultaneous growth spurt for Lily. Please roll a d6 and let me know the result."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"Rolling a 4 on the d6 means that Sapphire experiences a significant regression, losing another four years, now leaving her at the tender age of seven. This drastic reduction in physical age severely impacts her ability to care for the orphans and manage Lily's powers effectively, as she now appears younger than most of the children she was responsible for. Lily, absorbing those four years, matures into a thirteen-year-old, with a near adolescent's understanding and emotions. She looks down at her hands, still glowing with untapped magic, and then at Sapphire, who has become a little girl before her eyes. Lily's face registers a mixture of fear, guilt, and the dawning realization of the gravity of her situation. The other children, having witnessed this transformation, are struck by a mix of awe and concern. The atmosphere in the orphanage becomes one of subdued anxiety; Lily's powers are no longer just an issue of caretaking but have morphed into a matter that could fundamentally change their lives. At this moment, with Sapphire at such a young age and Lily approaching her teenage years, the headmistress understands that outside help can no longer be delayed. She decides it's time to put to use her network of contacts and seek a mage or an enchanter capable of teaching Lily how to harness her powers for good — or at least to prevent further harm. The story of Sapphire and Lily at this point would transition to a new phase, where the search for a mage knowledgeable in such rare magical anomalies becomes pivotal, and the role of Sapphire shifts as she, too, needs care and protection while she regains her lost years. It's a turning point that would redefine the future of the orphanage, the children, and the lives of both Sapphire and Lily."},{"prompt":"Write a list of years between 2004 and 2014, and 1 video game from each year.

It comes from the Arabic word \\"al-kuḥl\\" (الكحل), which originally referred to a method of extracting powders for cosmetics (like antimony sulfide for eyeliner), through a process of sublimation, and the powders themselves. The term was later extended to distilled substances in general, and by the late Middle Ages, it started to be associated with the distilled essence or spirit of wine, which we understand today as ethanol or ethyl alcohol. The term was borrowed from the Arabic by European alchemists and then by Middle English-speaking scholars. Through these transitions, the meaning of \\"alcohol\\" shifted from referring to a fine powder to a concentrated essence, and finally to the intoxicating element found in fermented and distilled liquors.

The prefix \\"al-\\" is the definite article in Arabic, equivalent to \\"the\\" in English. Over time, the word \\"al-kuḥl\\" encompassed more than just the cosmetic powder, to include the essence or spirit of a substance obtained through distillation. As alchemists and later scientists became familiar with distillation techniques, the term evolved and was eventually adopted into various European languages, including English, as \\"alcohol.\\" In modern English, alcohol is understood to mean the class of chemical compounds that have a hydroxyl (-OH) group bound to a carbon atom, with ethanol (drinking alcohol) being the most commonly known type."},{"prompt":"voglio che tu mi aiuti a creare una strategia per fare trading forex.","completion":"Creare una strategia di trading forex efficace richiede una comprensione approfondita dei mercati valutari, della gestione del rischio, dell'analisi tecnica e fondamentale, e della disciplina personale.

Di seguito sono riportate le linee guida per pianificare e sviluppare un EA di price action per MT4: # Pianificazione: 1. **Definizione di Price Action**: - Identifica quali elementi di price action vuoi che il tuo EA riconosca (es. pin bar, inside bar, engulfing patterns). 2. **Regole di Ingresso**: - Stabilisci regole precise per quando entrare in una posizione (es. all'apparizione di un particolare pattern di price action in zona di supporto/resistenza). 3. **Regole di Uscita**: - Decidi le condizioni per l'uscita (es. obiettivo di profitto, stop loss, trailing stop o un'inversione del pattern di price action). 4. **Gestione del Rischio**: - Definisci come l'EA gestirà le dimensioni della posizione e il rischio per ogni trade. 5. **Filtri**: - Aggiungi eventuali filtri per migliorare la qualità dei segnali (es. escludere segnali durante eventi di notizie ad alto impatto). # Sviluppo: Assumendo che tu abbia una conoscenza della programmazione MQL4 (linguaggio utilizzato per scrivere EAs in MetaTrader 4), puoi iniziare a codificare: 1. **Struttura di Base**: - Innanzitutto, imposta la struttura di base dell’EA: \`init()\`, \`deinit()\`, e \`start()\` funzioni che vengono rispettivamente utilizzate per l'inizializzazione, la de-inizializzazione e il ciclo principale di esecuzione dell’EA. 2. **Rilevamento dei Pattern**: - Sviluppa algoritmi per identificare i pattern di price action. Questo richiederà l'analisi della serie storica dei prezzi attraverso il prelievo di candele/barre da parte dell’EA. 3. **Gestione degli Ordini**: - Implementa la logica per inserire ordini di acquisto o vendita in base alle regole di ingresso che hai definito. - Assicurati di includere la funzione di gestione del rischio per ogni posizione che apri. 4. **Gestione del Rischio e dell'Uscita**: - Codifica i meccanismi per stop loss, take profit e trailing stop. 5. **Testing e Ottimizzazione**: - Fai un backtest dell’EA utilizzando il Strategy Tester di MT4. - Ottimizza l'EA modificando i parametri fino a quando non ottieni risultati soddisfacenti. 6. **Debugging**: - Correggi eventuali errori nel codice e assicurati che l'EA sia robusto e affidabile. 7. **Demo Trading**: - Prima di andare live, fai trading in tempo reale con un conto demo per valutare ulteriormente la performance dell’EA. Codificare un EA che funzioni bene non è una cosa semplice e può richiedere molte iterazioni di test e ottimizzazione. Se non si possiede un'adeguata conoscenza della programmazione MQL4, si può assumere uno sviluppatore esperto per creare l'EA secondo le proprie specifiche. Infine, va notato che fare trading con un EA comporta un certo grado di rischio, e gli EAs basati sul price action possono non funzionare ugualmente bene in tutte le condizioni di mercato. L'intervento umano e una supervisione costante sono fondamentali per correggere e adattare gli EAs alle mutevoli condizioni di mercato."},{"prompt":"in base ai tuoi dati, qual'è la strategia di price action migliore?","completion":"Come intelligenza artificiale, non sono dotata di capacità di trading o di accesso a dati di mercato in tempo reale, e non posso fornire consigli personalizzati sulle pratiche di trading migliori o garantire la validità di una strategia di price action rispetto a un'altra. Il successo con una strategia di price action dipende da molti fattori, inclusi i tempi di trading, il contesto del mercato, la dimensione della posizione, la gestione del rischio, oltre alla personalità e alle preferenze del trader. Tuttavia, qui ci sono alcune strategie di price action comunemente riconosciute come popolari tra i trader di forex: 1. **Trading sui livelli di supporto e resistenza**: I trader osservano il comportamento del prezzo quando si avvicina ai livelli storici di supporto (dove il prezzo ha smesso di cadere in passato) e resistenza (dove il prezzo ha smesso di salire). Alcuni trader cercano di entrare a mercato quando il prezzo rimbalza su un livello di supporto o resistenza, mentre altri aspettano una sconfitta di questi livelli prima di prendere una posizione. 2. **Trading sui trend**: Questa strategia implica l'identificazione della direzione dominante del mercato e l'ingresso in posizioni che seguono questa direzione. I trader di trend spesso cercano le pullback nel trend come opportunità per entrare con un rapporto rischio/rendimento favorevole. 3. **Price Action con candelieri giapponesi**: I pattern formati dai candelieri giapponesi, come pin bar, engulfing e harami, possono fornire segnali di ingresso o uscita. Ad esempio, un pin bar che si forma vicino ad un livello di supporto può indicare una possibile inversione rialzista. 4. **Breakout**: Gli operatori possono cercare momenti in cui il prezzo esce da un range consolidato o da un modello grafico (come un triangolo o un rettangolo). Questi breakout possono spesso portare a movimenti di prezzo forti e direzionali. 5. **Trading sulle fakeouts**: Contrariamente ai breakout, alcuni trader preferiscono aspettare una falsa rottura di un livello di supporto o resistenza e poi entrare nel trade nella direzione opposta, anticipando che il prezzo rientrerà nel suo range o modello precedente. È importante sottolineare che nessuna di queste strategie garantisce il successo di per sé; essenzialmente, la consistenza nel profitto derivante dal trading di price action proviene dalla comprensione profonda del mercato, dalla gestione disciplinata del rischio, e dal mantenimento di una psicologia di trading equilibrata. Prima di adottare una qualsiasi strategia, è essenziale fare pratica (attraverso un conto demo, per esempio), fare un'analisi approfondita e backtesting, e soprattutto, entrare sul mercato in maniera informata e cautelativa."},{"prompt":"proviamo a creare un EA sui breakouts. come scriveresti il codice se fossi un programmatore di MT4?","completion":"Scrivere un EA per tradare i breakout in MT4 comporta la creazione di un algoritmo che può identificare situazioni di mercato potenzialmente favorevoli per un breakout e quindi prendere decisioni di trading in tempo reale. Qui di seguito trovi una versione semplificata di come si potrebbe creare un tale EA in linguaggio MQL4: \`\`\`mql4 //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Expert advisor per il trading sui Breakouts | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ input double TakeProfit = 10.0; // Profitti in pips input double StopLoss = 10.0; // Perdite in pips input double BreakoutBuffer = 2.0; // Un buffer aggiunto/sottratto dal prezzo del breakout input int BreakoutDistance = 20; // Distanza in pips dal massimo/minimo storico per identificare il breakout //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Initialization function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ int OnInit() { // Initialize your EA here return(INIT_SUCCEEDED); } //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Expert tick function | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ void OnTick() { // Controlla gli ordini esistenti prima di piazzarne di nuovi if (OrdersTotal() > 0) return; double currentAsk = Ask; double currentBid = Bid; double breakoutHigh = High[Highest(NULL, 0, MODE_HIGH, BreakoutDistance, 0)]; double breakoutLow = Low[Lowest(NULL, 0, MODE_LOW, BreakoutDistance, 0)]; double takeProfitPrice, stopLossPrice; // Condizione di Buy Breakout if (currentAsk > (breakoutHigh + (BreakoutBuffer * _Point))) { takeProfitPrice = currentAsk + (TakeProfit * _Point); stopLossPrice = currentAsk - (StopLoss * _Point); OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, 0.1, currentAsk, 3, stopLossPrice, takeProfitPrice, \\"Buy Breakout\\", 0, 0, clrGreen); } // Condizione di Sell Breakout else if (currentBid < (breakoutLow - (BreakoutBuffer * _Point))) { takeProfitPrice = currentBid - (TakeProfit * _Point); stopLossPrice = currentBid + (StopLoss * _Point); OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_SELL, 0.1, currentBid, 3, stopLossPrice, takeProfitPrice, \\"Sell Breakout\\", 0, 0, clrRed); } } //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ \`\`\` Questo è un esempio molto semplice di un EA per breakout. Può essere notevolmente migliorato aggiungendo una gestione del rischio più sofisticata, filtrando i segnali in base alla volatilità o agli eventi di notizie economiche, o aggiungendo altre condizioni per l'ingresso. Qui cosa fa lo script: - Define i parametri di input per gli utenti come il take profit, lo stop loss e la distanza del breakout. - Controlla se ci sono già degli ordini aperti prima di inserirne di nuovi. - Determina i livelli di breakout come il massimo e il minimo entro una distanza definita dall'utente dal prezzo corrente. - Inserisce un ordine buy se il prezzo dell'ask supera il massimo più un buffer, con take profit e stop loss definiti. - Inserisce un ordine sell se il prezzo del bid scende sotto il minimo meno un buffer, con take profit e stop loss definiti. Ricorda, queste sono solo le basi. Lo sviluppo di un EA efficace richiede meticolosa pianificazione, test e ottimizzazione continua per assicurarsi che si comporti bene nelle varie condizioni di mercato. Inoltre, prima di utilizzare qualsiasi EA in un ambiente di trading live, è cruciale averlo testato a fondo in un ambiente di test per assicurarsi che funzioni come previsto senza causare perdite inaspettate."},{"prompt":"cosa darebbe la BreakoutDistance","completion":"La \`BreakoutDistance\` nell'ambito di un Expert Advisor (EA) che utilizza una strategia di breakout definisce il numero di barre (o candele) che l'algoritmo valuta per identificare i potenziali punti di breakout. La distanza aiuta a stabilire il punto più alto e il punto più basso in un intervallo di tempo specifico che l'EA utilizza come riferimento per determinare se il prezzo ha effettivamente violato un livello significativo, indicando così un breakout. Esempio di implementazione della \`BreakoutDistance\`: \`\`\`mql4 // Ottieni il prezzo più alto delle ultime BreakoutDistance barre double breakoutHigh = High[Highest(NULL, 0, MODE_HIGH, BreakoutDistance, 1)]; // Ottieni il prezzo più basso delle ultime BreakoutDistance barre double breakoutLow = Low[Lowest(NULL, 0, MODE_LOW, BreakoutDistance, 1)]; \`\`\` Nello script sopra, il \`Highest\` e il \`Lowest\` sono funzioni predefinite in MQL4 che cercano rispettivamente il valore più alto e più basso. Il primo argomento di queste funzioni (\`NULL\`) indica che si sta utilizzando il simbolo (coppia di valute) corrente visualizzato sul grafico su cui è attivo l'EA. Il secondo argomento (\`0\`) si riferisce al timeframe corrente del grafico. Gli argomenti \`MODE_HIGH\` e \`MODE_LOW\` specificano che stai cercando rispettivamente il massimo e il minimo prezzo di chiusura delle barre. L'argomento \`BreakoutDistance\` definisce il numero di barre passate che vuoi esaminare. Ad esempio, se \`BreakoutDistance\` è impostato su 20, l'EA esaminerebbe le ultime 20 barre per trovare il massimo e il minimo. Il numero \`1\` indica di partire dalla barra appena completata, ignorando la barra corrente, il che è importante perché la barra corrente può ancora cambiare fino alla fine del suo periodo. In sintesi, l'EA utilizza la \`BreakoutDistance\` per identificare una zona di breakout potenziale. Se il prezzo corrente supera la resistenza o infrange il supporto definiti da questi massimi e minimi storici, l'EA potrebbe interpretarlo come un segnale di breakout e aprire un trade di conseguenza."},{"prompt":"è profittevole nel 24% delle volte. idee su altre strategie che funzionino? dillo come se fossi un analista","completion":"Come analista, è importante notare che una percentuale di successo del 24% non necessariamente implica una strategia non profittevole; quello che conta è il rapporto globale tra rischio e rendimento dei trades vincenti rispetto ai perdenti. Tuttavia, se si ricerca una maggiore frequenza di operazioni vincenti o si desidera diversificare le strategie, ecco alcune alternative e miglioramenti che possono essere contemplati: 1. **Raffinamento della Strategia di Breakout:** - Incorpora la volatilità per identificare falsi breakout. Aumenta la \`BreakoutDistance\` durante periodi di bassa volatilità e riducila in periodi di alta volatilità. - Aggiungi filtri di tendenza come medie mobili per prendere trades solo nella direzione della tendenza dominante. 2. **Pivot Points e Livelli di S/R:** - Implementa un approccio che identifica i pivot points giornalieri, settimanali o mensili come possibili livelli di breakout. - Combinare i pivot points con gli indicatori di volume per rafforzare i segnali di breakout. 3. **Strategie basate su Range:** - Valuta il trading range quando non c'è un chiaro trend. Identifica un range di consolidamento e fai trading sui rimbalzi da supporti e resistenze. 4. **Rotazione di Coppie di Valute:** - Esamina diverse coppie di valute e concentra il trading su quelle con maggiore probabilità di trend o breakout, riducendo l'esposizione a coppie meno volatili o più imprevedibili. 5. **Trading su Pattern Grafici:** - Incorpora l'analisi di pattern grafici come triangoli, bandiere e cunei, che possono precedere movimenti di prezzo significativi. 6. **Trading di Eventi di Notizie:** - Utilizza il calendario economico per identificare gli eventi di notizie ad alto impatto e sviluppa strategie su come il mercato potrebbe reagire. 7. **Strategie di Mean Reversion:** - Quando il prezzo devia significativamente da una media mobile specifica, prendi in considerazione l'ipotesi di mean reversion con opportuni stop loss e target di profitto. 8. **Analisi Divergenza di Indicatori:** - Identifica le divergenze sulle oscillazioni degli indicatori come RSI, MACD rispetto al prezzo, il che potrebbe indicare potenziali inversioni. 9. **Correlation Trading:** - Esplora strategie che si basano sulla correlazione (positiva o negativa) tra coppie valutarie diverse per identificare e sfruttare le anomalie. 10. **Costruzione di Portafoglio e Diversificazione:** - Distribuisci il rischio su diverse strategie e asset per ridurre la volatilità del tuo portafoglio di trading e aumentare le opportunità di profitto. Ricorda sempre che il trading forex comporta rischi significativi e non esiste una \\"strategia magica\\" che garantisca profitto. Un buon approccio potrebbe essere quello di affinare la strategia attuale aumentando il rapporto rischio/rendimento oppure combinando l'approccio attuale con nuove strategie che possano coprire le fasi di mercato dove la strategia corrente non è ottimale. Infine, l'analisi dei dati storici tramite backtesting, il trade con conti demo per la verifica delle strategie in tempo reale e, se possibile, l'applicazione di strumenti di machine learning e ottimizzazione può portare a miglioramenti significativi nelle prestazioni della strategia di trading."},{"prompt":"Маршрут автобуса \\"547Ы Светлогорск — Калининград\\".

There’s one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily’s powers, and if she can’t, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it’d be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls. Regressing will give Sapphire penalties to her future rolls.","completion":"In this mystical fantasy world, Sapphire returns to the humble stone and timber structure that houses the whispers of her childhood memories, eager yet vigilant to lend her hand to the headmistress, an aging woman with kind eyes who nurtured many lost souls. Among the bustling flock of young ones scampering through corridors and playing in the lush gardens stands Lily, a cherub-faced toddler with a tumble of curls and a secret that belies her innocent gaze. As Sapphire steps through the threshold, the headmistress approaches her with both excitement and concern. \\"Welcome back, Sapphire. Your help is a blessing, but I must warn you about little Lily. She's special, endearing, but... unpredictable. Watch her carefully.\\" Sapphire nods, her azure eyes reflecting a determination and warmth understood only by those who have also known the ache of absence. She locates Lily, who is currently engaged in a solitary game of blocks in the corner of the playroom. \\"Hi, Lily,\\" Sapphire greets, kneeling to the floor to meet Lily's level, her hand extended in peace. Lily looks up, her eyes sparkling with an immeasurable depth as she reaches out to touch Sapphire's hand. This is your moment to roll the d20 to see if Sapphire manages to avoid Lily's regressive touch. If the roll is 16-20, Sapphire will sense the oncoming wave of temporal energy and pull away in time. If it's 11-15, she will feel a tingle but manages to hold back the full effect, resulting in her losing only one year. For a 6-10 roll, the hit is more significant, and Sapphire regresses by two years. On a 1-5, the power overwhelms her, and she loses three years, making it more difficult to control Lily and to command respect from the orphanage. Roll now to determine the outcome."},{"prompt":"5","completion":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire feels the warm, curious touch of Little Lily, and within moments a strange sensation pours through her. It is as if time itself curls around her fingers, tugging gently at her essence. A dizzy spell momentarily clouds her vision, and when her world settles, Sapphire is aghast to find that her clothes hang slightly looser, and the world seems just a little bit bigger. Sapphire has regressed back three years; she is now a 14-year-old girl, her maturity and physical development subtly wound back to a more juvenile state. As she scrambles to maintain her composure, the headmistress' words echo in her mind: Lily is indeed special, and now this regression has made it all the more challenging for Sapphire to watch over her and the other children. It's time for Sapphire to try her best to steer Lily away from the other youngsters, to safeguard their ages and their growth. Please roll the d20 again to see if Sapphire can regain her footing and manage to guide Lily away without further incident. Given her regression, Sapphire will face a slight penalty on her ability to influence and control the situation. For this next roll: If you roll a 16-20 (now reduced to 13-20 due to the penalty), Sapphire will successfully distract Lily and lead her to a safe activity where she can't harm anyone. For an 11-15 (now 8-12), she will only partially succeed, requiring constant vigilance to keep Lily engaged and prevent further incidents. A 6-10 (now 3-7) will mean Sapphire struggles significantly, leading to Lily inadvertently regressing another child in the orphanage.

Sapphire seizes this opportunity, \\"That’s a beautiful bird, isn't it, Lily? Let's draw it together!\\" She hopes that by engaging Lily in an activity, the rest of the children will be safe. The two of them sit down with parchment and charcoal, but Lily’s concentration wavers as she periodically reaches out, her tiny hand brushing against Sapphire's. Sapphire fights the mental fog trying to crowd her thoughts, remaining vigilant to hold Lily's attention on the drawing. As they draw, a small group of children approach, curious about what Lily and Sapphire are doing. Sapphire senses the danger and tries to keep Lily focused on the bird, but amidst the confusion and the close proximity of the other children, Lily's uncontrollable power surges once again. Please roll the d20 again to see if Sapphire can prevent Lily from accidently regressing another child during this commotion. Given the ongoing situation and her current age, the same penalties from the previous roll will apply. For a 13-20 roll, she'll manage to protect the other children, perhaps by engaging them in a separate activity or luring them away. For an 8-12, she’ll only be partly successful, with perhaps a minor regression that doesn't have serious consequences. On a 3-7, one of the orphans will endure a more noticeable regression.

As the children gather around, Lily's focus shifts from the charcoal drawing to the new audience. In the commotion, her hand sweeps across another child's arm, and Sapphire watches with a sinking heart as the energy flows uncontrollably once more. One of the approaching children, a boy of about seven named James, blinks rapidly as the temporal wave hits him. When the moment passes, the boy stands there, blinkingly confusedly, and a full two years younger—a five-year-old now staring back at them. His pants are suddenly loose, and he staggers slightly, no longer quite fitting his clothes. The other children gasp, some in fear and others in bewilderment, as they witness the transformation. The murmurs and whispers grow louder, spreading concern among the orphans. Sapphire knows she has to act fast to prevent panic and any further regressions. The urgent task now is to isolate Lily and ensure no one else gets too close to her. Sapphire gathers her resolve, despite feeling the effects of her own regression still weighing heavily on her. She must protect the children and find a way to handle Lily's mysterious abilities. Roll the d20 once more to see if Sapphire is able to handle the new situation, considering the penalty for her younger age and mounting stress. We will be using the same penalties as before due to the circumstances. For a 13-20 roll, Sapphire successfully calms the children and takes Lily to a safe place without further incidents. An 8-12 means that while she might manage to isolate Lily, the situation with the children remains tense and difficult to manage. On a 3-7 roll, not only is Sapphire struggling to contain the commotion, but she also risks being touched again by Lily, possibly regressing even further.

She calmly yet firmly ushers the children away, preventing them from crowding around Lily. \\"Everyone, let's give James and Lily some space,\\" Sapphire says with a confidence that belies her youthful age of 14. \\"Miss Molly needs help in the garden! Let's see who can pull the most weeds!\\" Redirecting their attention, the children are intrigued by the sudden challenge and quickly disperse from the room. Sapphire gives them a reassuring smile as they leave, even though her heart races with the fear of her own situation. With the room now cleared of other children, she turns her full attention to Lily, whose innocent eyes are wide with confusion at her own unpredictable power. \\"Lily, come with me, let's find a quiet place to read your favorite story,\\" Sapphire suggests gently, guiding her away by the hand, taking care to avoid skin-to-skin contact. The headmistress, having noticed the commotion, arrives at the doorway, her concern etched upon her face. She looks at Sapphire with both gratitude and worry, \\"You've done well under the circumstances,\\" she says. \\"We'll need to find a more permanent solution to protect Lily…and everyone else from her abilities.\\" For now, it appears that Sapphire's swift thinking and composure have prevented a potentially disastrous situation. The children are safe, and Lily has been isolated until a plan can be devised to handle her powers responsibly. Sapphire's role at the orphanage is more crucial than ever as she proves not only her capability but also her resilience. She must now work with the headmistress to understand Lily's powers and how to nurture her in a way that keeps all the children, including Sapphire herself, from the unintended consequences of Lily's mysterious gifts.

One afternoon, while Sapphire is overseeing playtime in the courtyard, Lily's gaze fixes upon a butterfly flitting past. In that moment of distraction, she wanders off toward the garden, drawn to the dancing colors of the wings. Her path unfortunately intersects with the older kids' robust game of tag. Seeing Lily nearing the boisterous group, Sapphire feels her pulse quicken. She knows she must intercept the three-year-old before an inadvertent touch might unleash her powers amidst the excitement. Roll the d20 to see if Sapphire can swiftly get to Lily before she comes into contact with the other children, potentially revisiting the difficulties of past weeks. For a 16-20 roll, Sapphire catches up to Lily in time, skillfully redirecting her attention and averting any incident. An 11-15 suggests that she makes it, but just barely, resulting in a moment of tension as she grabs Lily up just as another child nearly collides with them. On a 6-10, Sapphire stumbles or is delayed, and Lily touches another child, causing a minor but noticeable regression.

She stretches out her hand, a silent plea in her eyes, but it's too late. Lily, absorbed in her innocent quest for the butterfly, stumbles right into the path of two older children mid-tag. As one reaches out to tag the other, Lily brushes against both of their hands. There's a split second of stillness before the magic takes hold, and like ripples in a pond, the energy emanates from her touch. The two children, previously nearing the cusp of adolescence, find themselves suddenly shrinking, clothes sagging, features softening, as they regress to a more childlike state. The boy and girl, who were 12, now appear to be no older than 8, the confusion written plainly across their younger faces. A hush falls over the courtyard as the other kids stop their play, witnessing yet another transformative incident. Sapphire finally reaches Lily, scooping her up and away from the others, but the damage has been done, and the air is thick with disbelief and fear. Sapphire knows there's little time to waste—she needs to control the situation before panic sets in. She calls out to the children, her voice firm yet kind. \\"Everything is going to be okay.

The same penalties and challenges remain due to the nature of Lily's unpredictable power and the current stress of the situation. For a 13-20 roll, she manages to rally the children and guide them safely indoors, preventing additional chaos. On a score of 8-12, some children reluctantly agree, but a few are too scared and confused, making the task of wrangling them that much harder. If you roll a 3-7, the effort to gather the children is met with resistance, and during the struggle, Sapphire risks another regression.

Before Sapphire can gather the children, chaos ensues. Frightened by their friends' sudden change, some children run inside in search of safety, while others group together, whispering and casting worried glances at Lily. In the midst of this commotion, Sapphire feels a tiny hand slip into hers—Lily, seeking comfort from her big sister figure, inadvertently touches Sapphire's skin. The magic ripples through Sapphire once more, and as the world spins, she stumbles backward onto the soft grass. When her vision clears, Sapphire finds herself peering up from a much lower vantage point—she's now a 10-year-old girl. Her thoughts tangle and jumble; her memories of recent years are fuzzy. She scrambles to her feet, suddenly even less authoritative in the older children's eyes. Some of the younger kids giggle, not fully understanding the gravity, while others are scared and start crying, making the situation even harder to control. With her regressed stature and diminished presence, Sapphire tries to regain control. \\"Please, everyone, let's stay calm and find Miss Hilda,\\" she pleads, her voice now bearing the timbre of childhood. Now let's roll the d20 once again to determine if Sapphire, despite her setback, will be able to guide the children inside and to find the headmistress for help. For a 16-20 roll, she gathers her courage, and the children respond to her leadership, allowing her to direct them inside. An 11-15 means that her efforts are met with mixed success; several children follow her while others remain scattered and upset. With a 6-10, only a few children listen to her, and confusion continues to dominate the orphanage grounds.

The children become more scattered and upset, with some running about aimlessly and others grouping together, crying out for reassurance and guidance. Sapphire, now looking up rather than down at many of her charges, attempts to assert herself, but her youthful voice lacks the depth and authority it once had. The headmistress, hearing the commotion, hurries outside, her eyes widening at the sight of the children in disarray and Sapphire, notably younger. The headmistress understands the severity of the situation and springs into action. \\"Children, please, everyone come with me!\\" Her authoritative tone cuts through the clamor, and slowly but surely, the children start to listen, their innate trust in the headmistress drawing them toward her outstretched arms. As the children are corralled inside, Sapphire feels a mix of relief and helplessness. While the immediate crisis is being managed, the reality of her own regression weighs heavily on her. She fights back the tears, aware now that she is no longer the helper but perhaps in need of help herself. Now that the headmistress is involved, there's no need for an immediate roll. A plan must be devised to not only navigate this predicament but also to safeguard the future of the orphanage and all who call it home. The headmistress arranges for Lily to be given a quiet space away from the others while she discusses the next steps with her remaining staff. She turns to Sapphire, both of them knowing that solutions won't come easily. Sapphire's current age complicates her roles and responsibilities, and it's uncertain if or when the effects of Lily's powers can be reversed for all affected. \\"We need to find help,\\" the headmistress says quietly to Sapphire. \\"There are tales of those with knowledge of ancient magics who may know how to control or counteract such powers. We must find them.\\" Determined to return to her rightful age and to help the other children, Sapphire nods in agreement. The next part of their journey will take them beyond the walls of the orphanage and into the wider world, where they must seek the wisdom of sages and the aid of the inexplicably gifted. Sapphire's maturity, though locked within a young frame, will be pivotal as they venture forth into this uncertain adventure, driven by the hope that a remedy for Lily's uncontrollable power exists somewhere in the vast realms of their magical world."},{"prompt":"voglio che scrivi un EA per MT4 con le seguenti condizioni: BUY: EMA 8 taglia EMA 20 verso l'alto e RSI 14 è sopra 50 SELL: ema 8 taglia ema 20 verso il basso e RSI 14 è sotto 50","completion":"Creare un Expert Advisor (EA) richiede capacità di programmazione nell'ambiente MetaQuotes Language 4 (MQL4) dedicato alla creazione di script di trading per la piattaforma MetaTrader 4.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"translate this to persian: Abstract The prospect of speed reading—reading at an increased speed without any loss of comprehension—has undeniable appeal. Speed reading has been an intriguing concept for decades, at least since Evelyn Wood introduced her Reading Dynamics training program in 1959. It has recently increased in popularity, with speed-reading apps and technologies being introduced for smartphones and digital devices. The current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading process—a great deal—and discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speed-reading training programs or purchasers of speed-reading apps. The research shows that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds (e.g., from around 250 to 500–750 words per minute) while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed. If a thorough understanding of the text is not the reader’s goal, then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension. The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed. Introduction One day in 2007, six-time World Speed Reading Champion Anne Jones sat down in a popular bookstore on Charring Cross Road, London, and devoured the latest Harry Potter book in about 47 minutes (World Speed Reading Council, 2008). That worked out to a reading rate of over 4,200 words per minute (wpm). She then summarized the book for some British news sources. Another speed-reading enthusiast and promoter, Howard Berg, professes to be able to read as many as 30,000 wpm (World’s Fastest Reader on Pelosi Bill, 2011). Reading rates of this kind seem extraordinary, given that college-educated adults who are considered good readers usually move along at about 200 to 400 wpm. Given the immense volume of text available to us on a daily basis, it is unsurprising that most people would like to increase their reading rates to that of Jones or Berg. But is this possible? Some people suggest that it is: Proponents of speed-reading courses claim that we can dramatically increase our reading speed without sacrificing our understanding of the content by learning to take in more visual information at a single glance and by suppressing the inner speech that often occurs when we read silently. And now that text can be presented more dynamically, on digital devices as opposed to paper, there are claims that new methods of text presentation can allow us to read more quickly and with good understanding. The most popular of these technologies presents words rapidly one at a time on a computer screen using what is called rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). The claim is that, freed from the need to move our eyes, we can read more quickly than we normally would. Other technologies manipulate the colors of presented lines of text, claiming that this can help us to reduce skipping or repetition of lines. Is there a unique form of reading in which speed and comprehension are both high? Can we learn to read in this way through speed-reading courses, or can we achieve it with little or no practice by using special technologies? In this article, we address these questions. We begin by reviewing psychological research on normal reading and then discuss and evaluate methods that aim to increase reading speed. We adopt this approach because we believe that it is important to understand the visual and mental processes that occur in typical silent reading before determining whether special training or technologies can allow us to increase speed without sacrificing comprehension. Therefore, the first section of this article will review research on normal silent reading, focusing on those research findings that are most important for evaluating claims about speed reading. We will then consider the research on RSVP, the procedure that is used by some currently popular speed-reading technologies. With this background in place, we will evaluate speed-reading courses and technologies. As we will see, research shows that there is not a unique and easily learned behavior in which reading speed and comprehension are both high. There are effective ways of skimming a text to quickly find specific information, and skimming may suffice if complete and detailed comprehension of the text is not a priority. Reading can also be improved through practice. However, there is no quick and easy procedure that can allow us to read a text more quickly and still understand it to an equivalent level as careful reading. You will see why this is the case as we review what is known about normal reading. Reading, Skimming, and Speed Reading Before we embark on a discussion of research on normal reading and its implications for speed reading, we must provide a definition of reading. Reading is typically defined as the processing of textual information so as to recover the intended meaning of each word, phrase, and sentence. Of course, there are some forms of literature in which the author intentionally provides some level of ambiguity. For the most part, though, authors would like their readers to understand what they intend to communicate and to understand all of the words in the text. Often, the goal of reading is to learn something new, whether it is a fact from a textbook, a story from a novel, or instructions from a manual. Successful reading thus requires more than recognizing a sequence of individual words. It also requires understanding the relationships among them and making inferences about unstated entities that might be involved in the scenario being described. Reading can be contrasted with skimming, in which the goal is to quickly move one’s eyes through the text to find a specific word or piece of information or to get a general idea of the text content. As we will discuss later, skimming rates can be as much as two to four times faster than those of typical silent reading. Comprehension rates, however, are lower when skimming than when reading, suggesting a trade-off between speed and comprehension accuracy. Where does speed reading fall on the reading–skimming spectrum? Our brief discussion of trade-offs between speed and comprehension suggests that a reader cannot “have his cake and eat it too,” in the sense that comprehension must necessarily suffer if the reading process becomes more like skimming. Indeed, we will see there is little evidence for a unique behavior, such as speed reading, in which speed and comprehension are both high. The Reading Process To understand whether reading can be dramatically sped up while maintaining comprehension, it is important to understand how reading normally occurs. In this section, we review the visual and mental processes that are involved in silent reading when it proceeds as it typically does in educated adults, at a rate of about 200 to 400 wpm. Throughout the course of this discussion, it is important to keep in mind that reading is based on language; it is not a purely visual process. Speech is the primary form of language, and all human societies have a spoken language. (Groups of people who are deaf have developed languages that use the visual modality, but the primary languages employed by people with normal hearing all use the auditory modality.) We begin learning our spoken language as babies, and this process does not require explicit instruction. Reading and writing, which are relatively recent cultural inventions that are used in only some societies, normally require explicit instruction. That instruction begins around the age of 6 in many societies, although there are variations across cultures. It takes many years for a child to become a proficient reader. At first, children often read aloud, converting a printed text into the more familiar spoken form. Children gradually improve in their ability to read silently. Even in cultures in which reading is highly valued and widely taught, some children and adults never become good readers. These observations indicate that speech is the basic form of language; reading and writing is an “optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on” (Pinker, 1997, p. ix). Even though reading can be considered “an unnatural act” (Gough & Hillinger, 1980), many adults in modern societies perform this act quite skillfully. The body of research we now discuss has shed light on how they manage to do so. Writing systems A logical starting point for reviewing the mental and visual processes involved in reading is to consider what the eye takes in and what the cognitive system must then process: the elements of writing system. Writing normally takes the form of visible marks on a surface, whether it is a clay tablet, a sheet of paper, a computer monitor, or another digital screen. In most languages, written words are composed of smaller visual units that can be combined in various ways. The basic written symbols of English and other alphabetic writing systems are letters, which approximately represent the sounds of the language, the phonemes (Fig. 1). For example, the word bag is represented by using a letter that represents the “b” sound, a letter that represents the “a” sound, and a letter that represents the “g” sound. The letters are arranged left to right along a horizontal line in the case of English, but other writing systems use other arrangements. For example, Hebrew arranges its symbols horizontally from right to left.","completion":"Here is the translation of the provided text into Persian (Farsi): چکیده چشم‌انداز خواندن سریع - خواندن با سرعت افزایش یافته بدون از دست دادن فهم - جذابیت غیرقابل انکاری دارد. خواندن سریع از دهه‌ها پیش، حداقل از زمانی که ایولین وود در سال 1959 برنامه آموزشی دینامیک خواندن خود را معرفی کرد، مفهومی جذاب بوده است. اخیراً این موضوع با معرفی اپلیکیشن‌ها و فناوری‌های خواندن سریع برای گوشی‌های هوشمند و دستگاه‌های دیجیتال، محبوبیت بیشتری پیدا کرده است. مقاله حاضر به بررسی آنچه که جامعه علمی درباره فرایند خواندن - که بسیار زیاد است - می‌داند، پرداخته و دلالت‌های نتایج تحقیقات را برای دانش‌آموزان بالقوه برنامه‌های آموزش خواندن سریع یا خریداران اپلیکیشن‌های خواندن سریع مورد بحث قرار می‌دهد. تحقیقات نشان می‌دهد که میان سرعت و دقت تعادل وجود دارد. بعید است که خوانندگان بتوانند سرعت خواندن خود را دو یا سه برابر کنند (به عنوان مثال، از حدود 250 کلمه در دقیقه به 500-750 کلمه در دقیقه) ضمن اینکه همچنان متن را همانطور که با سرعت عادی می‌خواندند، درک کنند. اگر درک عمیق متن هدف خواننده نباشد، سپس خواندن سریع یا پرش در متن به خواننده اجازه می‌دهد که سریع‌تر با فهم متوسط از آن عبور کند. راه برای حفظ فهم بالا و عبور سریع‌تر از متن، تمرین خواندن و تبدیل شدن به یک کاربر زبان ماهرتر (به عنوان مثال، از طریق افزایش دایره واژگان) است. این امر به دلیل این است که مهارت زبان در قلب سرعت خواندن قرار دارد. مقدمه یک روز در سال 2007، آن جونز، قهرمان شش دوره مسابقات جهانی خواندن سریع، در یک کتابفروشی محبوب در خیابان چارینگ کراس در لندن نشست و آخرین کتاب هری پاتر را در حدود 47 دقیقه (شورای جهانی خواندن سریع، 2008) «خورد». این به میزان خواندن بیش از 4200 کلمه در دقیقه بود. سپس او خلاصه‌ای از کتاب را برای برخی منابع خبری بریتانیا ارائه داد. یک دیگر از علاقه‌مندان و ترویج‌کنندگان خواندن سریع، هاوارد برگ، ادعا می‌کند که می‌تواند تا 30000 کلمه در دقیقه (سریع‌ترین خواننده جهان در مورد لایحه پلوسی، 2011) بخواند. نرخ‌های خواندن از این نوع به نظر فوق‌العاده است، با توجه به اینکه بزرگسالان تحصیلکرده‌ای که به عنوان خوانندگان خوب در نظر گرفته می‌شوند، معمولاً با سرعت حدود 200 تا 400 کلمه در دقیقه پیش می‌روند. با توجه به حجم عظیم متنی که برای ما به طور روزانه در دسترس است، شگفت‌آور نیست که بیشتر مردم دوست دارند نرخ‌های خواندن خود را به سطح جونز یا برگ افزایش دهند. اما آیا این امکان‌پذیر است؟ برخی افراد پیشنهاد می‌دهند که اینگونه است: طرفداران دوره‌های خواندن سریع ادعا می‌کنند که ما می‌توانیم با یادگیری چگونگی دریافت اطلاعات بصری بیشتر در یک نگاه و با سرکوب گفتار درونی که اغلب هنگام خواندن ساکت رخ می‌دهد، سرعت خواندن خود را به شکل چشمگیری افزایش دهیم بدون اینکه فهم محتوا را قربانی کنیم. و حالا که متن می‌تواند به شکل پویاتری ارائه شود، روی دستگاه‌های دیجیتال به جای کاغذ، ادعاهایی وجود دارد که روش‌های جدید ارائه متن می‌تواند به ما اجازه دهد تا سریع‌تر و با فهم خوب بخوانیم. محبوب‌ترین این فناوری‌ها، کلمات را به سرعت یکی پس از دیگری روی صفحه نمایش کامپیوتر با استفاده از آنچه که نمایش تصویری سریال سریع (RSVP) نامیده می‌شود، ارائه می‌دهد. ادعا این است که، آزاد از نیاز به حرکت چشم‌ها، ما می‌توانیم سریع‌تر از حالت عادی بخوانیم. فناوری‌های دیگر رنگ خطوط ارائه شده متن را دستکاری می‌کنند، با ادعای این که این می‌تواند به ما کمک کند تا از پریدن یا تکرار خطوط کاهش دهیم. آیا یک شکل منحصر به فرد خواندن وجود دارد که در آن سرعت و فهم هر دو بالا باشد؟ آیا ما می‌توانیم از طریق دوره‌های خواندن سریع به این روش بخوانیم یا می‌توانیم آن را با کمی یا بدون تمرین با استفاده از فناوری‌های خاص دستیابیم؟ در این مقاله، ما به این سوالات می‌پردازیم. ما با بازبینی تحقیقات روانشناختی درباره خواندن عادی شروع می‌کنیم و سپس به بحث و ارزیابی روش‌هایی که هدف آنها افزایش سرعت خواندن است، می‌پردازیم. ما از این رویکرد استفاده می‌کنیم زیرا ما معتقدیم که درک فرایندهای بصری و ذهنی که در خواندن ساکت معمولی رخ می‌دهد قبل از تعیین اینکه آیا آموزش خاص یا فناوری‌ها می‌تواند به ما اجازه دهد تا سرعت را بدون قربانی کردن فهم افزایش دهیم، مهم است. بنابراین، بخش اول این مقاله به بررسی تحقیقات در مورد خواندن عادی ساکت خواهد پرداخت، با تمرکز بر یافته‌های تحقیقاتی که برای ارزیابی ادعاها درباره خواندن سریع مهمترین است. سپس ما تحقیقات در مورد RSVP، روشی که توسط برخی از فناوری‌های خواندن سریع محبوب فعلی استفاده می‌شود، را در نظر می‌گیریم. با این پس‌زمینه در جای خود، ما دوره‌های خواندن سریع و فناوری‌ها را ارزیابی خواهیم کرد. همانطور که ما می‌بینیم، تحقیقات نشان می‌دهد که رفتار منحصر به فرد و به راحتی آموخته شده‌ای که در آن سرعت و فهم هر دو بالا باشد، وجود ندارد. راه‌های مؤثری برای پرخوانی یک متن به منظور پیدا کردن سریع اطلاعات خاص وجود دارد و پرخوانی ممکن است کافی باشد اگر درک کامل و دقیق متن اولویت نباشد. خواندن نیز می‌تواند از طریق تمرین بهبود یابد. با این حال، روش سریع و آسانی وجود ندارد که بتواند به ما اجازه دهد یک متن را سریع‌تر بخوانیم و همچنان آن را به همان سطح دقت به عنوان خواندن دقیق درک کنیم. شما دلیل این امر را همانطور که در مورد خواندن عادی می‌دانیم، مرور خواهید کرد.

(گروه‌هایی از افراد ناشنوا زبان‌هایی را که از حالت بصری استفاده می‌کنند، توسعه داده‌اند، اما زبان‌های اصلی که توسط افراد با شنوایی معمولی استفاده می‌شود، همه از حالت شنیداری استفاده می‌کنند.) ما شروع به یادگیری زبان گفتاری خود به عنوان نوزاد، و این فرآیند نیازمند آموزش صریح نیست. خواندن و نوشتن، که اختراع‌های نسبتاً جدید فرهنگی هستند که فقط در برخی از جوامع استفاده می‌شود، معمولاً نیازمند آموزش صریح هستند. این آموزش در حدود سن 6 سالگی در بسیاری از جوامع شروع می‌شود، هرچند تفاوت‌هایی در فرهنگ‌ها وجود دارد. برای یک کودک سال‌ها طول می‌کشد که به یک خواننده ماهر تبدیل شود. در ابتدا، کودکان غالباً به صورت بلند می‌خوانند، یک متن چاپی را به فرم شناخته شده‌تر گفتاری تبدیل می‌کنند. کودکان به تدریج در خواندن ساکت بهبود می‌یابند. حتی در فرهنگ‌هایی که خواندن را ارزشمند قلمداد می‌کنند و به طور گسترده تدریس می‌شود، برخی کودکان و بزرگسالان هرگز به خوانندگان خوبی تبدیل نمی‌شوند. این مشاهدات نشان می‌دهند که گفتار شکل ابتدایی زبان است؛ خواندن و نوشتن یک \\"لوازم جانبی اختیاری است که باید با دقت بسیار به آن پرداخته شود\\" (پینکر، 1997، ص ix). حتی اگرچه خواندن را می‌توان \\"یک عمل غیرطبیعی\\" (گو و هیلینجر، 1980) در نظر گرفت، بسیاری از بزرگسالان در جوامع مدرن این عمل را به مهارت انجام می‌دهند. مجموعه تحقیقاتی که اکنون بحث می‌کنیم، نوری را بر چگونگی مدیریت آنها برای این کار افکنده است.

For example, the Chinese character 人 stands for “person.” Some Chinese characters contain components that provide a hint about the character’s pronunciation. However, these hints are not always present and, when present, are not always consistent or helpful. Most modern Chinese words contain more than one unit of meaning and must be expressed by a sequence of characters. For example, when the characters meaning “ground” (地) and “board” (板) are written together, they convey the meaning “floor” (地板). In Chinese, there are no spaces between any characters, so the only way a reader knows which two characters go together in a word is through experience. For the most part, however, this does not cause a problem for skilled readers. The symbols of modern writing systems require no shading, no color other than that needed to distinguish the writing from the background, and no meaningful distinctions between lighter and darker lines or between wider and narrower lines. Once a symbol has been learned, it can be recognized in many printed forms. This use of abstract codes rather than visual templates (McConkie & Zola, 1979) helps to explain why we are able to recognize that a word has the same meaning regardless of the font or case in which it is printed (see Fig. 2). Despite the fact that letters are recognized by their abstract forms rather than visual templates, good visual acuity is required to pick up the critical differences between the marks that distinguish visually similar letters—for example, the difference between h and n. If this difference is not perceived, one could mistake hot for not.","completion":"در برخی از سیستم‌های نوشتاری که الفبایی نیستند، نمادهای فردی که در یک خط چیده می‌شوند واحدهای معنایی، مرفم‌ها، را تا بجای واحدهای صدا نشان می‌دهند. به طور مثال، نویسه چینی 人 نماینده \\"شخص\\" است. برخی از نویسه‌های چینی شامل اجزایی هستند که سرنخی در مورد تلفظ نویسه را ارائه می‌دهند. با این حال، این سرنخ‌ها همیشه موجود نیستند و، هنگامی که وجود دارند، همیشه ثابت یا مفید نیستند. بیشتر کلمات مدرن چینی شامل بیش از یک واحد معنایی هستند و باید توسط دنباله‌ای از نویسه‌ها ابراز شوند. به عنوان مثال، زمانی که نویسه‌هایی که معنی \\"زمین\\" (地) و \\"تخته\\" (板) هستند کنار هم نوشته می‌شوند، آنها معنی \\"کف\\" (地板) را منتقل می‌کنند. در زبان چینی، فضای خالی بین هیچ نویسه‌ای وجود ندارد، بنابراین تنها راهی که خواننده می‌داند کدام دو نویسه در یک کلمه با هم می‌روند، از طریق تجربه است. با این حال، برای بخش اعظم، این مسئله برای خوانندگان ماهر مشکلی ایجاد نمی‌کند. نمادهای سیستم‌های نوشتاری مدرن نیازی به سایه‌زنی، رنگی غیر از آن چه که برای تمایز نوشته از پس‌زمینه لازم است، و تمایزهای معناداری بین خطوط تیره‌تر و روشن‌تر یا بین خطوط پهن‌تر و باریک‌تر ندارند. یک‌بار که یک نماد آموخته شده باشد، می‌توان آن را در بسیاری از فرم‌های چاپی تشخیص داد. استفاده از کدهای انتزاعی به جای الگوهای بصری (مک‌کانکی و زولا، 1979) به توضیح اینکه چرا ما قادریم تشخیص دهیم که یک کلمه همان معنی را دارد صرف‌نظر از فونت یا حالتی که در آن چاپ شده است (نگاه کنید به شکل 2)، کمک می‌کند. علی‌رغم اینکه حروف توسط فرم‌های انتزاعی‌شان تشخیص داده می‌شوند تا الگوهای بصری، دقت بصری خوب لازم است تا تفاوت‌های بحرانی بین نشانه‌هایی را که حروف بصری مشابه را تمیز می‌دهند، دریافت کند - به عنوان مثال، تفاوت بین h و n. اگر این تفاوت تشخیص داده نشود، کسی ممکن است hot را با not اشتباه بگیرد."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 2.

Visual processing and eye movements Given that writing is composed of fine lines and marks, the acuity (visual-resolution) limits of vision are an important constraint on the reading process. The premise behind some speed-reading courses is that it is possible to use peripheral vision to simultaneously read large segments of a page, perhaps even a whole page, instead of one word at a time (Brozo & Johns, 1986). However, such a process is not biologically or psychologically possible. One indication that it is not possible is that visual acuity is limited and that these limitations are what cause readers to make eye movements. Acuity is much higher in the fovea (from the center of vision—the fixation location—to 1° of visual angle away from it in any direction) than in the parafovea (1°–5° away from the center of vision) or periphery (areas more than 5° away from the center of vision; Balota & Rayner, 1991; Fig. 3). To get a sense of how small the foveal viewing area is, note that it is roughly equivalent to the width of your thumb held at arm’s length from your eye.","completion":"چون تشخیص فرم بصری صحیح کلمات یک پیش‌زمینه مهم برای بقیه فرایند خواندن است، اکنون به بحث در مورد پردازش بصری و نقش حرکات چشم در خواندن قبل از رفتن به جنبه‌های عمیق‌تر فرایند خواندن می‌پردازیم: شناسایی کلمات و درک معنا. پردازش بصری و حرکات چشم با توجه به اینکه نوشتن از خطوط و علائم ظریف تشکیل شده است، محدودیت‌های دقت (قدرت تفکیک بصری) دید یک محدودیت مهم روی فرایند خواندن است. فرض پشت برخی از دوره‌های خواندن سریع این است که امکان استفاده از دید محیطی برای خواندن همزمان قسمت‌های بزرگی از یک صفحه وجود دارد، شاید حتی یک صفحه کامل، به جای یک کلمه به طور متوالی (بروزو و جانز، 1986). اما، چنین فرایندی از نظر بیولوژیکی یا روانشناختی ممکن نیست. یک نشانه اینکه امکان‌پذیر نیست، این است که دقت بصری محدود است و این محدودیت‌ها هستند که باعث می‌شوند خوانندگان حرکات چشمی انجام دهند. دقت در فوویا (از مرکز دید - مکان تثبیت - به 1 درجه زاویه دید به هر جهت) بیشتر از پارافوویا (1 تا 5 درجه دور از مرکز دید) یا محیط (مناطقی که بیشتر از 5 درجه از مرکز دید دور هستند؛ بالوتا و رینر، 1991؛ شکل 3) می‌باشد. برای درک اینکه منطقه دید فوویال چقدر کوچک است، توجه کنید که تقریباً برابر عرض انگشت شست شما است که در فاصله دست از چشم نگه داشته شده است."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 3.

Therefore, the oculomotor (eye movement) system controls the sequence and timing of the visual system’s access to the text. Decisions about how long to fixate a word and when to move the eyes to the next word are to a large extent under the control of cognitive processes (Rayner, Liversedge, White, & Vergilino-Perez, 2003; Reingold, Reichle, Glaholt, & Sheridan, 2012; see Rayner & Reingold, 2015). They are not preprogrammed before one begins to read a text in the way that a metronome is set by a musician before he or she begins to practice a piece of music. This moment-by-moment control helps to ensure that the next word enters the system through foveal (high-resolution) vision with the optimal timing. In the following sections, we detail how the visual and oculomotor systems support and constrain the reading process. The visual system As mentioned, acuity is highest in the fovea, and this is the area in which the majority of word recognition occurs. One reason that acuity is higher in the fovea than in other areas of the visual field is related to the distribution of two types of neural receptors that respond to light—rods and cones. Cones are sensitive to color and detail and are more effective in bright light, while rods are sensitive only to brightness (e.g., shades of gray) and motion and are mostly sensitive (i.e., useful) in dimly lit rooms or at night. Cones are concentrated in the fovea and decrease in density with increasing distance from fixation. Rods are least concentrated in the fovea and increase in density with increasing distance from fixation (Fig. 4). Because cones are more sensitive to detail, this means that acuity is higher in the fovea, where there are more cones, than in nonfoveal areas.","completion":"حرکات ساکادیک (حرکات چشمی سریع و بالستیک) به خوانندگان اجازه می‌دهند فوویا را به کلمه‌ای که می‌خواهند با بالاترین کارآمدی پردازش کنند، جابجا کنند. بنابراین، سیستم حرکتی چشم (سیستم حرکت چشم) ترتیب و زمان‌بندی دسترسی سیستم بصری به متن را کنترل می‌کند. تصمیم‌گیری‌ها در مورد زمان تثبیت کردن بر روی یک کلمه و زمانی برای جابجایی چشم‌ها به کلمه بعدی تا حد زیادی تحت کنترل فرایندهای شناختی است (راینر، لیورسج، وایت، و ورجیلینو-پرز، 2003؛ راینگولد، رایشل، گلهولت، و شریدان، 2012؛ ببینید راینر و راینگولد، 2015). آنها قبل از شروع خواندن یک متن به شکلی که مترونوم توسط یک موسیقی‌دان قبل از شروع تمرین یک قطعه موسیقی تنظیم می‌شود، برنامه‌ریزی شده نیستند. این کنترل لحظه‌به‌لحظه به اطمینان از ورود کلمه بعدی از طریق دید فوویال (قدرت تفکیک بالا) با زمان‌بندی بهینه کمک می‌کند. در بخش‌های بعدی، ما به جزئیات نحوه پشتیبانی و محدود کردن فرایند خواندن توسط سیستم‌های بصری و حرکتی چشم می‌پردازیم. سیستم بصری همانطور که گفته شد، دقت در فوویا بالاتر است و این منطقه‌ای است که بیشتر شناسایی کلمات در آن اتفاق می‌افتد. یکی از دلایلی که دقت در فوویا بیشتر از دیگر نواحی میدان دید است مربوط به توزیع دو نوع گیرنده عصبی که به نور واکنش نشان می‌دهند - میله‌ها و مخروط‌ها - است. مخروط‌ها به رنگ و جزئیات حساس هستند و در نور روشن‌تر کارآمدتر هستند، در حالی که میله‌ها فقط به روشنایی (مثلاً سایه‌های خاکستری) و حرکت حساس‌اند و عمدتاً در اتاق‌های کم‌نور یا شب‌ها حساس (یعنی مفید) هستند. مخروط‌ها در فوویا متمرکزند و با افزایش فاصله از نقطه تثبیت، تراکمشان کاهش می‌یابد. میله‌ها کمترین تمرکز را در فوویا دارند و با افزایش فاصله از نقطه تثبیت، تراکمشان افزایش می‌یابد (شکل 4). از آنجا که مخروط‌ها برای جزئیات حساس‌ترند، این بدان معناست که دقت در فوویا، جایی که مخروط‌ها بیشترند، بیشتر از نواحی غیرفوویال است."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 4. Diagrams showing the distribution of rods and cones across the visual field (left panel) and retina (right panel). Another reason why acuity is higher in the fovea than in other areas of the visual field has to do with the way information is transmitted from rods and cones (located in the retina—a membrane lining the back of the inside of the eyeball) to the brain. Information from rods is pooled (averaged across a group of rods) before being relayed to the brain, while information from individual cones is relayed directly, without being combined with information from other cones (Fig. 5). The consequence of this organization is that even minute variations in the pattern of light hitting the fovea will be preserved by the cones. If one cone receives bright light and an adjacent cone receives very dim light, the brain will perceive a light/dark boundary. In contrast, minute variations in the pattern of light hitting nonfoveal areas (where cones are sparse and there are mostly rods) will be obscured. If one rod receives bright light and an adjacent rod receives very dim light, the brain will perceive a gray blob.","completion":"شکل 4. نمودارهایی که توزیع میله‌ها و مخروط‌ها را در میدان دید (پانل چپ) و شبکیه (پانل راست) نشان می‌دهند. دلیل دیگری که دقت در فوویا بیشتر از سایر نقاط میدان دید است به نحوه انتقال اطلاعات از میله‌ها و مخروط‌ها (که در شبکیه - پرده‌ای که پشت داخل چشم را می‌پوشاند - قرار دارند) به مغز مربوط می‌شود. اطلاعات از میله‌ها قبل از انتقال به مغز جمع‌آوری می‌شوند (میانگین‌گیری از گروهی از میله‌ها)، در حالی که اطلاعات از مخروط‌های فردی به طور مستقیم و بدون ترکیب با اطلاعات از سایر مخروط‌ها منتقل می‌شوند (شکل 5). نتیجه این سازماندهی آن است که حتی تغییرات جزئی در الگوی نور وارد شده به فوویا توسط مخروط‌ها حفظ خواهد شد. اگر یک مخروط نور روشن و مخروط مجاور نور بسیار کمی دریافت کند، مغز یک مرز روشن/تاریک را درک خواهد کرد. در مقابل، تغییرات جزئی در الگوی نور وارد شده به نواحی غیرفوویال (جایی که مخروط‌ها کم و عمدتاً میله‌ها وجود دارند) مبهم خواهد بود. اگر یک میله نور روشن و میله مجاور نور بسیار کمی دریافت کند، مغز یک لکه خاکستری را درک خواهد کرد."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 5. Diagram showing how information is relayed from the retina to the brain. Information from cones (top panel) is relayed directly through bipolar cells to ganglion cells and onward to the brain, whereas information from rods (bottom panel) is pooled (averaged) through bipolar cells and ganglion cells. These facts about rods and cones have some important implications for reading. As we have discussed, all text, regardless of writing system, is composed of combinations of lines, normally dark on a white background. Therefore, fine discrimination between dark and light areas is essential to recognizing the visual elements of writing. If the light pattern coming from a word hits the fovea, the cones will easily recognize such fine detail and relay the pattern—with high fidelity—to the brain. However, if the word hits nonfoveal areas and is sensed primarily by rods, it will be relayed to the brain as an average and will appear fuzzy. This will make it difficult to discern the exact identities of the symbols (see the beginning and the end of the sentence represented in Fig. 3). In fact, when people are asked to report the identity of a word that is presented so briefly that they cannot make an eye movement, accuracy is high in the fovea but drops off dramatically outside of it, with performance reaching chance level around the middle of the parafovea (approximately 3° of visual angle away from fixation; Bouma, 1973; see also Bouma, 1978; Rayner & Morrison, 1981). These facts cast doubt on suggestions from speed-reading proponents that people can read more effectively by using peripheral vision, taking in an entire line or even an entire page at a time. Eye movements For over a century, researchers have been monitoring eye movements in order to study the cognitive processes underlying reading. The technology has evolved over the years so that eye tracking can now be achieved with a high-speed video camera connected to a computer and can be used to study readers of any age. In general, these technologies work by computing the location of the eye up to one thousand times per second, allowing the researcher to know, with precision to the millisecond, which word and where in the word the reader is looking at a particular time. This information can then be separated into times when the eyes remain in the same location (i.e., during fixations) and times when they move between locations (i.e., during saccades). In this section, we review what has been discovered in studies of experienced adult readers, generally college students, who are reading silently in their first language. As mentioned earlier, the reason readers make saccades is to move their fovea to the next word. The eyes are relatively stable during fixations, which last approximately 250 ms for experienced adult readers. In general, no new visual information is obtained during saccades (Matin, 1974), but cognitive processing continues during this time (Irwin, 1998). This is important, because some speed-reading technology developers have claimed that saccades waste time. However, because cognitive processing continues during saccades, this time is not wasted. We can conclude, however, that fixations are the reader’s opportunity to obtain new visual information from the text. Although the average fixation lasts about 250 ms, there is considerable variability in how long an individual fixation lasts. These variations reflect such things as the legibility of the text (e.g., light/dark contrast, filled-in or removed spaces between words), linguistic difficulty (e.g., word frequency, predictability, ambiguity), properties of the reader (e.g., age or reading skill), and task goals (e.g., reading, proofreading, skimming). One reason fixations last as long as they do is that eye movements are motor responses that require time to plan and execute. For example, even in the simple task of moving the eyes to a new stimulus that appears either to the left or to the right of the eye’s current location, the reaction time is in the range of 100 to 1,000 ms, depending on the stimuli and experimental conditions (see Gilchrist, 2011). The reaction time in reading is in the shorter end of this range, 150 to 200 ms, because the eyes generally move in one direction (Becker & Jürgens, 1979; Rayner, Slowiaczek, Clifton, & Bertera, 1983). Additionally, a number of processes are being conducted at once: Processing of the fixated word, planning to move the eyes forward, and processing of the upcoming word using parafoveal information all overlap in time. This means that saccade latencies in reading can be shorter than in simple saccadic reaction-time tasks because some of the cognitive processing that leads to the decision of when to move the eyes can occur before the fixation on a particular word even begins. On average, forward saccades when reading English last about 20 to 35 ms and span the distance of 7 letters. Saccade durations, like fixation durations, are variable. But the variation is mostly determined by the distance traveled rather than by the cognitive and linguistic variables that affect fixation durations (Rayner, 1998, 2009). Saccades usually move from one word to the next word. However, about 30% of the time, readers move past the next word to the following one. These skips are more likely to happen when the word is very short, extremely frequent, and/or highly predictable from the prior context. The word the has these characteristics, and it is skipped about 50% of the time or more (see Angele & Rayner, 2013). Importantly, just because a word is skipped does not mean that it was not processed at all. All major theories of reading posit that word skipping is based on at least partial recognition of the word from information obtained in parafoveal vision and/or expectations about the word’s identity. In fact, if readers are given passages to read in which words that most people skip over are omitted, comprehension suffers rather dramatically (Fisher & Shebilske, 1985). This shows that readers are actually processing many or most of the words they skip over, along with the words they fixate. It also suggests that every reader is unique in terms of the timing and sequence of words he or she needs to directly look at in order to read efficiently. What works for some people, such as the initial readers in Fisher and Shebilske’s study, who were able to choose which words they fixated, does not work for others, such as the readers who got the modified text. The implication is that speed-reading devices that control the timing of word presentation may not be ready to use “out of the box” but instead may need to be tailored to each individual user based on how that person would naturally process the text. Not all saccades move forward to the next word in the text (Fig. 6). A small proportion of eye movements result in refixations on the same word. Refixations are most common for long words, about 7 or more letters long in English, for which the end part of the word may not fall within the word-identification span (described below). About 10% to 15% of the time, skilled readers make regressions, moving backward in the text to a previous word. Regressions are different from return sweeps—eye movements that go from the end of one line of text to the beginning of the next. Although return sweeps and regressions are both right-to-left movements in writing systems that go from left to right, such as English, return sweeps continue to move forward with respect to the progression of the text, whereas regressions move backward.","completion":"شکل 5. نموداری که نحوه انتقال اطلاعات از شبکیه به مغز را نشان می‌دهد. اطلاعات از مخروط‌ها (پانل بالا) مستقیماً از طریق سلول‌های دوقطبی به سلول‌های گانگلیون و سپس به مغز منتقل می‌شوند، در حالی که اطلاعات از میله‌ها (پانل پایین) جمع‌آوری (میانگین‌گیری) شده از طریق سلول‌های دوقطبی و سلول‌های گانگلیون. این واقعیت‌ها در مورد میله‌ها و مخروط‌ها برخی پیامدهای مهم برای خواندن دارند. همانطور که بحث شد، تمام متون، صرف‌نظر از سیستم نوشتاری، از ترکیبات خطوط ساخته شده‌اند، که معمولاً تیره بر روی پس‌زمینه سفید هستند. بنابراین، تشخیص ظریف بین نواحی تیره و روشن برای شناسایی عناصر بصری نوشتار ضروری است. اگر الگوی نور منتقل شده از یک کلمه به فوویا برسد، مخروط‌ها به راحتی چنین جزئیات ظریفی را تشخیص می‌دهند و الگو را با وفاداری بالا به مغز منتقل می‌کنند. با این حال، اگر کلمه به نواحی غیرفوویال برخورد کند و عمدتاً توسط میله‌ها احساس شود، آن به عنوان میانگین به مغز منتقل شده و مبهم به نظر خواهد رسید. این کار را برای تمیز دادن هویت دقیق نماد‌ها دشوار خواهد کرد (نگاه کنید به ابتدا و انتهای جمله‌ای که در شکل 3 نمایش داده شده است). در حقیقت، زمانی که از افراد خواسته می‌شود تا هویت یک کلمه‌ای که به اندازه‌ای کوتاه ارائه شده است که آنها نمی‌توانند یک حرکت چشمی انجام دهند، دقت در فوویا بالا است اما خارج از آن به شدت پایین می‌آید و عملکرد حدود نیمه پارافوویا (تقریباً 3 درجه زاویه دید از تثبیت) به سطح شانس می‌رسد (بوما، 1973؛ همچنین ببینید بوما، 1978؛ رینر و موریسون، 1981). این واقعیت‌ها شک‌هایی را راجع به پیشنهادات از طرف حامیان خواندن سریع که افراد می‌توانند با استفاده از دید محیطی، به طور مؤثرتری بخوانند و یک خط کامل یا حتی یک صفحه کامل را یک باره دریافت کنند، بوجود می‌آورند. حرکات چشم بیش از یک قرن است که محققان حرکات چشم را برای مطالعه فرایندهای شناختی زیربنای خواندن رصد می‌کنند. فناوری در طول سال‌ها تکامل یافته به گونه‌ای که اکنون ردیابی چشم می‌تواند با یک دوربین ویدئویی با سرعت بالا که به یک رایانه متصل شده است، انجام شود و می‌تواند برای مطالعه خوانندگان هر سنی مورد استفاده قرار گیرد. به طور کلی، این فناوری‌ها با محاسبه محل چشم تا هزار بار در ثانیه کار می‌کنند و به محقق این امکان را می‌دهند که با دقت میلی‌ثانیه‌ای بداند که در یک زمان خاص، خواننده به کدام کلمه و در کدام قسمت آن نگاه می‌کند. این اطلاعات می‌تواند به زمان‌هایی که چشم‌ها در یک محل ثابت می‌مانند (یعنی در طول تثبیت) و زمان‌هایی که بین محل‌ها حرکت می‌کنند (یعنی در طول ساکادها) تفکیک شوند. در این بخش، ما به بررسی آنچه در مطالعات خوانندگان بزرگسال با تجربه، معمولاً دانشجویان کالج، که به زبان اولیه خود به طور ساکت می‌خوانند، کشف شده است، پرداخته‌ایم. همان‌طور که قبلا ذکر شد، دلیلی که خوانندگان ساکاد‌ها را انجام می‌دهند، این است که فوویایشان را به کلمه بعدی ببرند. چشم‌ها در طول تثبیت‌ها نسبتاً پایدار هستند، که برای خوانندگان بزرگسال با تجربه حدوداً 250 میلی‌ثانیه به طول می‌انجامد. به طور کلی، هیچ اطلاعات بصری جدیدی در طول ساکاد‌ها به دست نمی‌آید (متین، 1974)، اما پردازش شناختی در طول این زمان ادامه دارد (ایروین، 1998). این مهم است، زیرا برخی توسعه‌دهندگان فناوری خواندن سریع ادعا کرده‌اند که ساکاد‌ها وقت را تلف می‌کنند. با این حال، از آنجا که پردازش شناختی در طول ساکاد‌ها ادامه دارد، این زمان تلف نشده است. با این حال، می‌توانیم نتیجه بگیریم که تثبیت‌ها فرصتی برای خواننده برای به دست آوردن اطلاعات بصری جدید از متن هستند. اگرچه میانگین تثبیت حدود 250 میلی‌ثانیه به طول می‌انجامد، در طول مدت یک تثبیت فردی تنوع زیادی وجود دارد. این تفاوت‌ها چیزهایی مانند قابل خواندن بودن متن (مثلاً تضاد روشن/تاریک، فاصله‌های پر شده یا حذف شده بین کلمات)، دشواری‌های زبانی (مثلاً فراوانی کلمات، پیش‌بینی‌پذیری، ابهام)، ویژگی‌های خواننده (مثلاً سن یا مهارت خواندن)، و اهداف کاری (مثلاً خواندن، ویرایش، پرخوانی) را منعکس می‌کنند. یکی از دلایلی که تثبیت‌ها به اندازه‌ای که هستند، طول می‌کشد این است که حرکات چشم پاسخ‌های حرکتی هستند که نیاز به زمان برای برنامه‌ریزی و اجرا دارند. به عنوان مثال، حتی در کار ساده حرکت دادن چشم‌ها به یک محرک جدید که یا به چپ یا به راست از محل فعلی چشم ظاهر می‌شود، زمان واکنش در محدوده 100 تا 1000 میلی‌ثانیه است، بسته به محرک‌ها و شرایط آزمایشی (مشاهده کنید گیلکریست، 2011). زمان واکنش در خواندن در کوتاه‌ترین انتهای این محدوده است، 150 تا 200 میلی‌ثانیه، زیرا چشم‌ها عموماً به یک جهت حرکت می‌کنند (بکر و یورگنس، 1979؛ راینر، سلویاچک، کلیفتون، و برترا، 1983). علاوه بر این، چندین فرایند به طور هم‌زمان در حال انجام هستند: پردازش کلمه تثبیت شده، برنامه‌ریزی برای حرکت دادن چشم‌ها به جلو، و پردازش کلمه بعدی با استفاده از اطلاعات پارافوویال، همه در زمان هم‌پوشانی می‌کنند. این بدان معناست که تأخیر‌های ساکاد در خواندن می‌توانند کوتاه‌تر از کار‌های واکنش زمانی ساکادی ساده باشند زیرا برخی از پردازش‌های شناختی که منجر به تصمیم‌گیری در مورد زمان حرکت دادن چشم‌ها می‌شوند می‌توانند قبل از شروع تثبیت روی یک کلمه خاص صورت گیرند. به طور میانگین، ساکاد‌های جلویی هنگام خواندن زبان انگلیسی حدود 20 تا 35 میلی‌ثانیه به طول می‌انجامند و فاصله‌ای به اندازه 7 حرف را طی می‌کنند. مدت زمان‌های ساکاد، مانند مدت زمان‌های تثبیت، متغیر هستند. اما تغییرات عمدتاً توسط فاصله طی شده تعیین می‌شوند تا توسط متغیرهای شناختی و زبانی که مدت زمان‌های تثبیت را تحت تأثیر قرار می‌دهند (راینر، 1998، 2009). ساکاد‌ها معمولاً از یک کلمه به کلمه بعدی حرکت می‌کنند. با این حال، حدود 30٪ از زمان، خوانندگان از کلمه بعدی به کلمه دیگری حرکت می‌کنند. این پرش‌ها هنگامی که کلمه بسیار کوتاه، بیش از اندازه فراوان و/یا از متن قبلی به شدت قابل پیش‌بینی باشد، احتمال بیشتری دارد. کلمه the این ویژگی‌ها را دارد و حدود 50٪ از زمان یا بیشتر پرش می‌کند (مشاهده کنید آنجل و راینر، 2013). مهم است توجه داشته باشیم که فقط به این دلیل که از یک کلمه پرش شده است، به این معنا نیست که آن کلمه اصلاً پردازش نشده است. تمام نظریه‌های اصلی خواندن می‌گویند که پرش از کلمه بر اساس حداقل شناسایی جزئی کلمه از اطلاعات به دست آمده در دید پارافوویال و/یا انتظارات در مورد هویت کلمه است. در حقیقت، اگر کلماتی که بیشتر مردم از آنها پرش می‌کنند، از متن خواندنی که به خوانندگان داده می‌شود حذف شوند، درک به طور قابل توجهی آسیب می‌بیند"},{"prompt":"please continue and translate further sections","completion":"از شکل 6). حرکات رفت‌وبرگشت کوچکی از حرکات چشم منجر به تثبیت مجدد بر روی همان کلمه می‌شود. تثبیت‌های مجدد معمولاً

Saccade durations, like fixation durations, are variable. But the variation is mostly determined by the distance traveled rather than by the cognitive and linguistic variables that affect fixation durations (Rayner, 1998, 2009). Saccades usually move from one word to the next word. However, about 30% of the time, readers move past the next word to the following one. These skips are more likely to happen when the word is very short, extremely frequent, and/or highly predictable from the prior context. The word the has these characteristics, and it is skipped about 50% of the time or more (see Angele & Rayner, 2013). Importantly, just because a word is skipped does not mean that it was not processed at all. All major theories of reading posit that word skipping is based on at least partial recognition of the word from information obtained in parafoveal vision and/or expectations about the word’s identity. In fact, if readers are given passages to read in which words that most people skip over are omitted, comprehension suffers rather dramatically (Fisher & Shebilske, 1985). This shows that readers are actually processing many or most of the words they skip over, along with the words they fixate. It also suggests that every reader is unique in terms of the timing and sequence of words he or she needs to directly look at in order to read efficiently. What works for some people, such as the initial readers in Fisher and Shebilske’s study, who were able to choose which words they fixated, does not work for others, such as the readers who got the modified text. The implication is that speed-reading devices that control the timing of word presentation may not be ready to use “out of the box” but instead may need to be tailored to each individual user based on how that person would naturally process the text. Not all saccades move forward to the next word in the text (Fig. 6). A small proportion of eye movements result in refixations on the same word. Refixations are most common for long words, about 7 or more letters long in English, for which the end part of the word may not fall within the word-identification span (described below). About 10% to 15% of the time, skilled readers make regressions, moving backward in the text to a previous word. Regressions are different from return sweeps—eye movements that go from the end of one line of text to the beginning of the next. Although return sweeps and regressions are both right-to-left movements in writing systems that go from left to right, such as English, return sweeps continue to move forward with respect to the progression of the text, whereas regressions move backward.","completion":"به طور میانگین، ساکادهای جلویی هنگام خواندن زبان انگلیسی حدود 20 تا 35 میلی‌ثانیه طول می‌کشند و مسافتی معادل 7 حرف را طی می‌کنند. مدت زمان‌های ساکاد، مانند مدت زمان‌های تثبیت، متغیر است. اما تغییرات عمدتاً تعیین‌شده توسط فاصله‌ای است که طی می‌شود تا توسط متغیرهای شناختی و زبانی که بر مدت تثبیت‌ها اثر می‌گذارند (راینر، 1998، 2009). ساکادها معمولاً از یک کلمه به کلمه بعدی حرکت می‌کنند. با این حال، حدود 30٪ از زمان، خوانندگان از کلمه بعدی به کلمه دنباله‌دار حرکت می‌کنند. این پرش‌ها بیشتر هنگامی اتفاق می‌افتند که کلمه بسیار کوتاه، بسیار متداول، و/یا از متن پیشین به شدت قابل پیش‌بینی است. کلمه \\"the\\" این ویژگی‌ها را دارد و حدود 50٪ از زمان یا بیشتر پرش داده می‌شود (نگاه کنید به آنجله و راینر، 2013). مهم است که تنها به این دلیل که از یک کلمه پرش داده شده، به این معنا نیست که اصلاً پردازش نشده است. همه تئوری‌های اصلی خواندن فرض می‌کنند که پرش کلمه بر اساس دست‌کم شناسایی جزئی کلمه از اطلاعات به دست آمده از دید پارافوویال و/یا انتظارات در مورد هویت کلمه استوار است. در واقع، اگر از خوانندگان خواسته شود مقاطعی بخوانند که کلماتی که بیشتر افراد از آن پرش می‌کنند حذف شده‌اند، فهم به شکل قابل توجهی آسیب می‌بیند (فیشر و شبیلسکه، 1985). این نشان می‌دهد که خوانندگان در واقع بسیاری یا بیشتر کلماتی که پرش می‌کنند را، به همراه کلماتی که بر روی آنها تثبیت می‌کنند، پردازش می‌کنند. همچنین نشان می‌دهد که هر خواننده منحصر به‌فرد است از نظر زمان‌بندی و ترتیب کلماتی که او باید مستقیماً برای خواندن مؤثر به آنها نگاه کند. آنچه برای برخی از افراد کار می‌کند، مانند خوانندگان اولیه در مطالعه فیشر و شبیلسکه، که توانایی انتخاب کلماتی که بر روی آنها تثبیت می‌کردند را داشتند، برای دیگران کار نمی‌کند، مانند خوانندگانی که متن اصلاح‌شده را گرفتند. نتیجه‌گیری این است که دستگاه‌های خواندن سریع که تایمینگ ارائه کلمات را کنترل می‌کنند ممکن است آماده استفاده \\"از قبل\\" نباشند، بلکه باید بر اساس نحوه طبیعی پردازش متن توسط هر کاربر به صورت انفرادی سفارشی سازی شوند. همه ساکادها به سمت کلمه بعدی در متن حرکت نمی‌کنند (نگاه کنید به شکل 6). درصد کوچکی از حرکات چشم منجر به تثبیت مجدد بر روی همان کلمه می‌شود. تثبیت‌های مجدد بیشتر برای کلمات طولانی، حدوداً 7 حرف یا بیشتر به طول در انگلیسی، که قسمت انتهایی کلمه ممکن است در محدوده شناسایی کلمه قرار نگیرد، رخ می‌دهد. حدود 10٪ تا 15٪ از زمان، خوانندگان ماهر بازگشت‌هایی ایجاد می‌کنند، که به عقب در متن به سمت کلمه قبلی حرکت می‌کند. بازگشت‌ها متفاوت از برگشت‌های خطی هستند - حرکات چشمی که از انتهای یک سطر متن به آغاز خط بعدی می‌روند. اگرچه هم برگشت‌های خطی و هم بازگشت‌ها هر دو حرکت از راست به چپ در سیستم‌های نوشتاری که از چپ به راست پیش می‌روند، مانند انگلیسی، هستند، برگشت‌های خطی همچنان نسبت به پیشرفت متن، به جلو حرکت می‌کنند، در حالی که بازگشت‌ها به عقب حرکت می‌کنند."},{"prompt":"and this please: Because return sweeps tend to be long saccades, there is some error in where they land, sometimes requiring an additional fixation to correct (Just & Carpenter, 1980). In general, though, these corrective saccades take half the time that normal saccades take and do not disrupt the reading process too much (in fact, readers almost never notice them). Some color-based technologies for presenting text have recently been developed that aim to make it easier to make return sweeps. However, as we will discuss in more detail later, return sweeps and other aspects of oculomotor control are generally not the difficult part of reading. Faulty language processing generally causes problems in eye movement programming, not the other way around. Regressions are more important than return sweeps with respect to understanding reading because they constitute a deviation of the reader’s eye movements from the normal progression of the text. Although some regressions are made to correct for oculomotor error (e.g., the eye’s landing too far past the intended word), many regressions are made to correct a failure in comprehension (e.g., when the reader has misinterpreted the sentence). This is important in the context of speed-reading technologies that use RSVP because these technologies do not allow people to reread the text to correct misunderstandings in an intelligent way that is informed by the reader’s understanding of the text. Given that most backward eye movements are made in order to repair a failure in comprehension, readers would maintain misinterpretations if they forced themselves to keep moving forward and would comprehend the text less well (Schotter, Tran, & Rayner, 2014). The use of foveal and parafoveal information to process text Now that we have reviewed the characteristics of eye movements, we return to the issue of how information is obtained from a text once an eye movement is made. Visual perception occurs very rapidly—so rapidly, in fact, that even if a word disappears completely after being directly looked at for only 60 ms, reading behavior is unaffected. That is, fixation durations have been shown to be similar regardless of whether the word remains visible or is erased or masked after 60 ms (Ishida & Ikeda, 1989), and in both cases, the durations continue to be sensitive to linguistic properties of the fixated word (e.g., how common it is; Rayner et al., 2003). These findings suggest that visual perception takes up only a small fraction of fixation durations, leaving time for higher-level cognitive and linguistic processing to occur before the decision of when to move the eyes next. Crucially, the finding that readers’ eyes remained on words that had disappeared for as long as they would have if the words had still been there suggests that the reading system naturally delays looking directly at the next word until it has performed a certain amount of linguistic processing of the currently fixated word. Therefore, devices that present words faster than readers’ natural pace may run the risk of presenting a word before the brain is prepared to process and understand it. Although acuity is lower in the parafovea than in the fovea, information in the parafovea is not completely ignored. If the word to the right of the fixated word disappears after 60 ms, reading behavior is disrupted (even if the word reappears once it is directly fixated; Rayner, Liversedge, & White, 2006). This finding suggests that readers use information from more than just the fixated word in order to read efficiently. This is important in light of speed-reading technologies that present just one word at a time: They do not allow the opportunity to use information from the next word. A different way to determine how much is seen in a single fixation is to examine eye fixations when readers can see clearly only a limited window of text that moves as the eyes move, using the gaze-contingent moving-window paradigm (McConkie & Rayner, 1975; see Rayner, 2014, for a review). In this paradigm, the reader’s fixation location is monitored and the text is manipulated based on the position of the eye (Fig. 7). The letters immediately surrounding the center of fixation are revealed, forming a window of clear text. Each of the letters outside the window, in some studies including the spaces, is replaced with an x. On different trials, the window may be small (e.g., as small as a single letter) or large (e.g., 40 letters). The experimenter measures reading rate as a function of window size. The general finding is that reading rate increases as the window size increases until it reaches an asymptote, the point at which reading rate is equivalent to that with a completely visible line. The window size at the asymptote point represents the size of the reader’s perceptual span. In general, in English the size of the perceptual span is 3 to 4 letter spaces to the left of fixation (McConkie & Rayner, 1976; Rayner, Well, & Pollatsek, 1980) and 14 to 15 letter spaces to the right of fixation (McConkie & Rayner, 1975; Rayner & Bertera, 1979).","completion":"چون برگشت‌های خطی معمولاً ساکادهای طولانی هستند، برخی خطا در محل فرود آن‌ها وجود دارد، گاهی اوقات نیاز به یک تثبیت اضافی برای اصلاح وجود دارد (جاست و کارپنتر، 1980). اما به طور کلی، این ساکادهای اصلاحی نیمی از زمانی را که ساکادهای معمولی می‌گیرند، طول می‌کشند و فرایند خواندن را خیلی برهم نمی‌زنند (در واقع، خوانندگان تقریباً هرگز آن‌ها را متوجه نمی‌شوند). برخی از فناوری‌های ارائه متن مبتنی بر رنگ اخیراً توسعه یافته‌اند که هدف آن‌ها راحت‌تر کردن برگشت‌های خطی است. با این حال، همانطور که بعداً با جزئیات بیشتری بحث خواهیم کرد، برگشت‌های خطی و دیگر جنبه‌های کنترل حرکتی چشم به طور کلی بخش سخت خواندن نیستند. اشکال در پردازش زبانی معمولاً مشکلاتی را در برنامه‌ریزی حرکات چشمی ایجاد می‌کند، نه برعکس. بازگشت‌ها در درک خواندن از برگشت‌های خطی مهم‌تر هستند چون به منحرف شدن حرکات چشم خواننده از پیشرفت عادی متن مربوط می‌شوند. اگرچه برخی از بازگشت‌ها برای اصلاح خطای حرکتی چشمی انجام می‌شوند (مثلاً چشم بیش از حد مورد نظر به جلو می‌افتد)، بسیاری از بازگشت‌ها برای اصلاح شکست در فهم انجام می‌شوند (مثلاً وقتی خواننده جمله را اشتباه تفسیر می‌کند). این مسئله در زمینه فناوری‌های خواندن سریع که از RSVP استفاده می‌کنند مهم است چرا که این فناوری‌ها به افراد اجازه نمی‌دهند متن را مجدداً برای اصلاح سوء تفاهم‌ها به شیوه‌ای هوشمندانه که توسط درک خواننده از متن راهنمایی شده باشد، بخوانند. با توجه به اینکه اکثر حرکات چشم به عقب به منظور اصلاح شکست در فهم انجام می‌شوند، خوانندگان اگر خودشان را وادار به حرکت به جلو کنند، سوء تفاهم‌ها را حفظ خواهند کرد و متن را کمتر خواهند فهمید (شوتر، تران، و راینر، 2014). استفاده از اطلاعات فوویال و پارافوویال برای پردازش متن اکنون که ما ویژگی‌های حرکات چشم را بررسی کردیم، به مسئله چگونگی به دست آوردن اطلاعات از متن پس از انجام یک حرکت چشم باز می‌گردیم. ادراک بصری بسیار سریع رخ می‌دهد - به سرعتی که حتی اگر یک کلمه پس از تنها 60 میلی‌ثانیه نگاه مستقیم به‌طور کامل ناپدید شود، رفتار خواندن تحت تأثیر قرار نمی‌گیرد. یعنی نشان داده شده‌است که مدت زمان تثبیت‌ها مشابه هستند چه کلمه دیده شود و چه پس از 60 میلی‌ثانیه پاک یا پوشش داده شود (ایشیدا و ایکدا، 1989)، و در هر دو مورد، مدت زمان‌ها همچنان به ویژگی‌های زبانی کلمه تثبیت‌شده حساس می‌مانند (مثلاً چقدر رایج است؛ راینر و همکاران، 2003). این یافته‌ها نشان می‌دهند که ادراک بصری فقط بخش کوچکی از مدت زمان‌های تثبیت را به خود اختصاص می‌دهد، زمانی را برای پردازش شناختی و زبانی سطح بالاتر قبل از تصمیم‌گیری در مورد زمانی که باید بعدی چشم‌ها حرکت کنند، باقی می‌گذارد. به طور حیاتی، یافته‌ای که نشان می‌دهد چشم‌های خوانندگان بر روی کلماتی که ناپدید شده‌اند به اندازه‌ای که اگر کلمات هنوز آنجا بودند باقی مانده‌اند، نشان می‌دهد که سیستم خواندن به‌طور طبیعی نگاه کردن مستقیم به کلمه بعدی را تا زمانی که مقداری پردازش زبانی از کلمه فعلی تثبیت‌شده انجام داده به تأخیر می‌اندازد. بنابراین، دستگاه‌هایی که کلمات را سریع‌تر از سرعت طبیعی خواندن‌ها ارائه می‌دهند، ممکن است خطر ارائه کلمه قبل از آمادگی مغز برای پردازش و درک آن را به همراه داشته باشند. اگرچه دقت در پارافوویا پایین‌تر از فوویا است، اطلاعات در پارافوویا کاملاً نادیده گرفته نمی‌شود. اگر کلمه سمت راست کلمه تثبیت‌شده پس از 60 میلی‌ثانیه ناپدید شود، رفتار خواندن مختل می‌شود (حتی اگر کلمه دوباره ظاهر شود وقتی که به‌طور مستقیم تثبیت می‌شود؛ راینر، لیورسج، و وایت، 2006). این یافته نشان می‌دهد که خوانندگان از اطلاعات بیشتر از فقط کلمه تثبیت‌شده برای خواندن مؤثر استفاده می‌کنند. این موضوع در نور فناوری‌های خواندن سریع که تنها یک کلمه در یک زمان ارائه می‌دهند مهم است: آنها فرصت استفاده از اطلاعات کلمه بعدی را فراهم نمی‌آورند. راه دیگری برای تعیین میزان دید در یک تثبیت واحد، مطالعه تثبیت‌های چشمی است که در آن خوانندگان فقط یک پنجره محدود از متن را که همزمان با حرکت چشم‌ها حرکت می‌کند، به وضوح می‌بینند، با استفاده از الگوی پنجره متحرک گزینشی نگاه (مک‌کانکی و راینر، 1975؛ نگاه کنید به راینر، 2014، برای بررسی). در این الگو، محل تثبیت خواننده رصد می‌شود و متن بر اساس موقعیت چشم دستکاری می‌شود (نگاه کنید به شکل 7). حروفی که دقیقاً اطراف مرکز تثبیت قرار دارند آشکار می‌شوند و پنجره‌ای از متن واضح را تشکیل می‌دهند. هر یک از حروف خارج از پنجره، در برخی مطالعات از جمله فضاها، با حرف x جایگزین می‌شوند. در آزمون‌های مختلف، پنجره ممکن است کوچک (مثلاً به کوچکی یک حرف واحد) یا بزرگ (مثلاً 40 حرف) باشد. محقق نرخ خواندن را به عنوان تابعی از اندازه پنجره اندازه‌گیری می‌کند. یافته کلی این است که نرخ خواندن با افزایش اندازه پنجره افزایش می‌یابد تا زمانی که به یک حد نهایی می‌رسد، نقطه‌ای که در آن نرخ خواندن معادل آن با یک خط کاملاً قابل مشاهده است. اندازه پنجره در نقطه حد نهایی اندازه محدوده ادراکی خواننده را نشان می‌دهد. به طور کلی، در انگلیسی اندازه محدوده ادراکی 3 تا 4 فضای حرف به چپ تثبیت (مک‌کانکی و راینر، 1976؛ راینر، ول، و پولاتسک، 1980) و 14 تا 15 فضای حرف به راست تثبیت است (مک‌کانکی و راینر، 1975؛ راینر و برترا، 1979)."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 7. Diagram of the moving-window paradigm with a 9-character window. From top to bottom, the lines show successive displays of an example sentence. The centers of the blue rectangles represent the locations of fixations, and the size of the rectangles reflects the size of the window. The perceptual span is determined not by physical space or the distance traveled by the eyes but rather by the amount of linguistic information that can be obtained from the text. This fact is demonstrated in several ways. First, the distance the eyes move during a saccade is equivalent (when measured in terms of number of letters), regardless of the distance from the reader or size of the text (Morrison & Rayner, 1981). Second, across languages, there are differences in the size and shape of the perceptual span. In Chinese, it is 1 character to the left and 3 to the right (Inhoff & Liu, 1998), and it is larger to the left than to the right in both Hebrew (Pollatsek, Bolozky, Well, & Rayner, 1981) and Arabic (Jordan et al., 2014). These differences reflect differences in the languages and writing systems. The perceptual span in Chinese is smaller than in English because words are shorter in Chinese (mostly 2 characters) than in English (on average, about 5 letters). The size of the perceptual span in the two languages is equivalent when measured in number of words instead of number of characters, suggesting that there may be a generally optimal rate of uptake of linguistic information that is more or less consistent across languages. The asymmetry of the perceptual span is reversed in Hebrew and Arabic compared to English because Hebrew and Arabic are read right to left and English is read left to right—the perceptual span is larger in the direction of reading compared to where the reader has already been. Third, the asymmetry of the perceptual span switches toward the direction of the eye movement when readers make regressions (Apel, Henderson, & Ferreira, 2012). Thus, the size of the perceptual span is not a physical limitation; otherwise, it would not change with reading direction. Rather, the perceptual span reflects constraints on how linguistic information from the text is obtained and used to recognize and understand words. Further evidence that the perceptual span is limited by cognitive and linguistic factors rather than just by acuity comes from a study that used a clever manipulation to compensate for the drop-off in acuity that occurs in the parafovea (Miellet, O’Donnell, & Sereno, 2009). This parafoveal magnification technique is similar to the moving-window technique. However, instead of text being masked outside the center of vision, it is magnified as a function of distance from fixation (Fig. 8). On every fixation, parafoveal and peripheral letters should have been perceivable to the same degree as foveal letters because of the magnification. It turned out that this manipulation did not increase the size of the perceptual span. If our ability to obtain useful information from the text were limited solely by visual acuity, increasing the visibility of eccentric letters would have allowed them to be perceived better and would have increased the size of the perceptual span. The results of the study suggest that the perceptual span is limited by our ability to identify and process the meaning of the words in the text.","completion":"شکل 7. نمودار پارادایم پنجره متحرک با پنجره‌ای به اندازه 9 نویسه. از بالا به پایین، خطوط نمایش‌های متوالی یک جمله نمونه را نشان می‌دهند. مراکز مستطیل‌های آبی مکان‌های تثبیت را نمایش می‌دهند و اندازه مستطیل‌ها اندازه پنجره را منعکس می‌کند. محدوده ادراکی تعیین نمی‌شود به واسطه فضای فیزیکی یا فاصله‌ای که توسط چشم‌ها طی می‌شود، بلکه توسط میزان اطلاعات زبانی که می‌توان از متن به دست آورد. این واقعیت به روش‌های مختلفی نشان داده شده‌است. نخست، فاصله‌ای که چشم‌ها در طول یک ساکاد حرکت می‌کنند معادل است (هنگامی که به تعداد نویسه‌ها اندازه‌گیری می‌شود)، صرف‌نظر از فاصله از خواننده یا اندازه متن (موریسون و راینر، 1981). دوم، در بین زبان‌ها، تفاوت‌هایی در اندازه و شکل محدوده ادراکی وجود دارد. در چینی، این محدوده یک کاراکتر به چپ و 3 به راست است (اینهوف و لیو، 1998)، و در هر دوی عبری (پولاتسک، بولوزکی، ول، و راینر، 1981) و عربی (جردن و همکاران، 2014) بزرگتر به سمت چپ است. این تفاوت‌ها، تفاوت‌هایی در زبان‌ها و سیستم‌های نوشتاری را منعکس می‌کنند. محدوده ادراکی در چینی کوچکتر از انگلیسی است زیرا کلمات در چینی کوتاه‌تر (بیشتر 2 کاراکتر) از انگلیسی (به طور متوسط حدود 5 حرف) هستند. اندازه محدوده ادراکی در هر دو زبان معادل است وقتی به تعداد کلمات به جای تعداد کاراکترها اندازه‌گیری می‌شود، نشان‌دهنده‌ی اینکه ممکن است یک نرخ بهینه عمومی برای جذب اطلاعات زبانی وجود داشته باشد که کمابیش در بین زبان‌ها ثابت است. نامتقارن بودن محدوده ادراکی در عبری و عربی در مقایسه با انگلیسی معکوس شده است زیرا عبری و عربی از راست به چپ خوانده می‌شوند و انگلیسی از چپ به راست خوانده می‌شود - محدوده ادراکی در جهت خواندن نسبت به جایی که خواننده از آن عبور کرده بزرگتر است. سوم، نامتقارن بودن محدوده ادراکی به سمت جهت حرکت چشم تغییر می‌کند وقتی خوانندگان بازگشت‌ها را انجام می‌دهند (آپل، هندرسون، و فریرا، 2012). بنابراین، اندازه محدوده ادراکی یک محدودیت فیزیکی نیست؛ در غیر این صورت با جهت خواندن تغییر نمی‌کرد. در عوض، محدوده ادراکی محدودیت‌هایی را بر روی چگونگی به دست آوردن و استفاده از اطلاعات زبانی از متن برای شناسایی و درک کلمات منعکس می‌کند. شواهد بیشتری که نشان می‌دهند محدوده ادراکی توسط عوامل شناختی و زبانی محدود می‌شود تا فقط توسط دقت، از مطالعه‌ای که از یک دستکاری هوشمندانه برای جبران افت دقتی که در پارافوویا رخ می‌دهد، استفاده می‌کند (میلت، او دونل، و سرنو، 2009). این تکنیک بزرگنمایی پارافوویال مشابه تکنیک پنجره متحرک است. با این حال، به جای اینکه متن خارج از مرکز دید پنهان شود، به عنوان تابعی از فاصله از تثبیت بزرگنمایی می‌شود (نگاه کنید به شکل 8). در هر تثبیت، حروف پارافوویال و محیطی به دلیل بزرگنمایی باید به اندازه حروف فوویال قابل تشخیص باشند. معلوم شد که این دستکاری اندازه محدوده ادراکی را افزایش نداد. اگر توانایی ما برای به دست آوردن اطلاعات مفید از متن فقط توسط دقت بصری محدود می‌شد، افزایش قابلیت دید حروف اکسنتریک باید اجازه می‌داد آن‌ها بهتر تشخیص داده شوند و اندازه محدوده ادراکی را افزایش دهند. نتایج مطالعه نشان می‌دهند که محدوده ادراکی توسط توانایی ما برای شناسایی و پردازش معنای کلمات در متن محدود است."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 8. Depiction of the parafoveal-magnification paradigm. The location of each fixation is indicated with an arrow, and the corresponding display for that fixation is represented.

When a word falls within the perceptual span, it can be perceived but not necessarily fully identified. In fact, the area from which words can be identified, the word-identification span, is much smaller than the perceptual span. The word-identification span is about 7 characters to the right of fixation in English (see Rayner, 1998). Thus, with normal text, there is a small window comprising the currently fixated word and one or two words to the right within which words are identified. The perceptual span is a larger window, used to perceive the visual layout of the text (i.e., where the words and spaces are, in writing systems that use spaces) in order to plan eye movements. The final aspect of the perceptual span that we should point out is that readers do not access any information from the lines above or below the line currently being read (Pollatsek, Raney, LaGasse, & Rayner, 1993). This is important because it is inconsistent with the speed-reading claim that someone can read an entire page at once. The findings about the perceptual span suggest that, contrary to the claims of speed-reading courses, readers cannot obtain information from a very large area of the visual field but rather primarily process text in the center of vision (i.e., the fovea). Further support for this idea comes from a study that used the moving-mask paradigm (Rayner & Bertera, 1979). This technique is similar to the moving-window technique except that the mask (i.e., the string of xs that replaces the letters in the text) moves in synchrony with the eyes, obscuring the text in foveal vision instead of nonfoveal vision. In this study, readers were extremely disrupted when even a single letter in the fovea was masked—their reading rates dropped by half and continued to drop precipitously as the size of the mask increased. Therefore, readers were not able to read effectively by relying on parafoveal and peripheral vision alone. Although research using the moving-window paradigm provides us with an assessment of how much of the text readers can perceive on a given fixation, it tells us little about what type of information is obtained from words before they are fixated and how this information is used in reading. To investigate this, researchers have used the boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975). Here, people read sentences in which a specific word is manipulated. Initially, it is replaced with a different word (or nonword) called the preview. As illustrated in Figure 9, there is an invisible boundary located just prior to this preview word, which, when crossed by the reader’s gaze, causes the preview to change to the target word—the word that makes sense in the sentence. Readers are rarely aware that words are changing because the change occurs during a saccade when vision is suppressed (Matin, 1974). However, the change may be noticeable if it is visually drastic (e.g., if an ascending letter such as h changes to a descending letter such as y) or if the eyes were very close to the preview word before the boundary was crossed (Slattery, Angele, & Rayner, 2011).","completion":"شکل 8. توصیف پارادایم بزرگنمایی پارافوویال. محل هر تثبیت با یک فلش نشان داده شده و نمایش مربوط به آن تثبیت نشان داده شده است. خطوط متوالی ترتیب زمانی تثبیت‌ها را نشان می‌دهند. بازچاپ شده از \\"بزرگ‌نمایی پارافوویال: دقت بصری محدوده ادراکی در خواندن را تغییر نمی‌دهد\\" توسط اس. میلت، پ. جی. او‌دانل، و اس. سی. سرنو، 2009، علوم روانشناختی، 20، ص. 722. کپی‌رایت 2009 توسط انجمن علوم روانشناختی. با اجازه بازچاپ شده است. هنگامی که یک کلمه در محدوده ادراکی قرار می‌گیرد، می‌توان آن را ادراک کرد اما لزوماً به طور کامل شناسایی نشده است. در واقع، منطقه‌ای از کلمات می‌توانند شناسایی شوند، محدوده شناسایی کلمه، بسیار کوچکتر از محدوده ادراکی است. محدوده شناسایی کلمه در انگلیسی حدود 7 نویسه به راست تثبیت است (راینر، 1998 را ببینید). بنابراین، با متن عادی، یک پنجره کوچک وجود دارد که شامل کلمه تثبیت شده فعلی و یک یا دو کلمه به راست است که در آن کلمات شناسایی می‌شوند. محدوده ادراکی یک پنجره بزرگتر است، که برای به دست آوردن طرح بصری متن استفاده می‌شود (یعنی کجا کلمات و فضاها هستند، در سیستم‌های نوشتاری که از فضا استفاده می‌کنند) تا حرکات چشمی برنامه‌ریزی شوند. جنبه نهایی از محدوده ادراکی که باید اشاره کنم این است که خوانندگان هیچ اطلاعاتی از خطوط بالا یا پایین خطی که در حال خواندن هستند، به دست نمی‌آورند (پولاتسک، رینی، لاگاسه، و راینر، 1993). این مهم است زیرا با ادعای خواندن سریع که فردی می‌تواند یک صفحه کامل را به یکباره بخواند، ناسازگار است. یافته‌ها درباره محدوده ادراکی نشان می‌دهند که خلاف ادعاهای دوره‌های خواندن سریع، خوانندگان نمی‌توانند اطلاعات را از منطقه بسیار بزرگ میدان بصری به دست آورند، بلکه عمدتاً متن را در مرکز دید (یعنی فوویا) پردازش می‌کنند. پشتیبانی بیشتر برای این ایده از مطالعه‌ای ناشی می‌شود که از پارادایم ماسک متحرک استفاده کرد (راینر و برترا، 1979). این تکنیک مشابه تکنیک پنجره متحرک است به جز اینکه ماسک (یعنی رشته‌ای از xها که جایگزین نویسه‌ها در متن می‌شوند) با چشم‌ها همزمان حرکت می‌کند و متون را در دید فوویال به جای دید غیرفوویال مخفی می‌کند. در این مطالعه، خوانندگان به شدت مختل شدند حتی وقتی فقط یک حرف در فوویا ماسک شد - نرخ خواندن‌شان به نصف کاهش یافت و به شدت ادامه‌ی افت کرد هرچقدر اندازه ماسک افزایش پیدا کرد. بنابراین، خوانندگان قادر به خواندن مؤثر با تکیه صرفاً بر دید پارافوویال و محیطی نبودند. هرچند تحقیق با استفاده از پارادایم پنجره متحرک به ما ارزیابی اینکه چقدر از متن خوانندگان می‌توانند در یک تثبیت خاص تشخیص دهند را ارائه می‌دهد، کمتر در مورد اینکه چه نوع اطلاعاتی قبل از تثبیت شدن از کلمات به دست آورده می‌شود و چگونه این اطلاعات در خواندن استفاده می‌شوند، به ما می‌گوید. برای بررسی این، محققان از پارادایم مرز استفاده کرده‌اند (راینر، 1975). در اینجا، افراد جملاتی را می‌خوانند که در آن‌ها یک کلمه خاص دستکاری شده‌است. در ابتدا، آن با یک کلمه متفاوت (یا غیر کلمه) که نمایش نامیده می‌شود جایگزین می‌شود. همانطور که در شکل 9 نشان داده شده‌است، یک مرز نامرئی قبل از این کلمه نمایش قرار دارد که، وقتی توسط نگاه خواننده عبور می‌کند، باعث تغییر نمایش به کلمه هدف - کلمه‌ای که در جمله منطقی‌است - می‌شود. خوانندگان به ندرت متوجه می‌شوند که کلمات تغییر می‌کنند زیرا تغییر در طول یک ساکاد که در آن دید مهار می‌شود، رخ می‌دهد (متین، 1974). با این حال، تغییر ممکن است محسوس باشد اگر به شدت بصری باشد (مثلاً اگر یک حرف صعودی مانند h به یک حرف نزولی مانند y تغییر کند) یا اگر چشم‌ها بسیار نزدیک به کلمه‌ی نمایش قبل از عبور از مرز بودند (اسلتری، آنجله، و راینر، 2011)."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 9. Diagram of the boundary paradigm. The vertical dashed line represents the location of the boundary, which is invisible in the experiment. When the reader’s gaze (represented by gray circles) crosses this location, between the third-to-last and second-to-last lines, the preview word (“kfevl,” in this example) changes to the target word (“front”). The general finding from studies using the boundary paradigm is that readers obtain parafoveal preview benefit. That is, they are faster to read the target when the preview was identical to the target than when the preview differed from the target (for a review, see Schotter, Angele, & Rayner, 2012). The boundary paradigm allows researchers to manipulate the nature of the relationship between the preview and target in order to gain more detailed information about exactly what type of information causes the preview benefit. We turn now to studies that have addressed this issue, which is important in the context of speed-reading technologies that present one word at a time and do not allow for parafoveal preview. Readers obtain something more abstract from the input than pure visual features. This was cleverly demonstrated by McConkie and Zola (1979), who had readers learn to read something like “AlTeRnAtInG cAsE” and then either changed the case of each of the letters (making the text read “aLtErNaTiNg CaSe”) or left the letters unchanged during a saccade. Changing the case of the letters did not affect fixation durations at all, suggesting that readers had discarded the exact visual form of the letters and that their reading behavior was based on abstract letter codes (i.e., the identity of the letters; see also Friedman, 1980; Rayner, McConkie, & Zola, 1980; Slattery et al., 2011). But beyond the identity of letters, there is abundant evidence that readers are faster to read a target word when the preview was phonologically related to it. This holds true for readers of alphabetic writing systems such as English (Pollatsek, Lesch, Morris, & Rayner, 1992) and French (Sparrow & Miellet, 2002) as well as non-alphabetic systems such as Chinese (Pollatsek, Tan, & Rayner, 2000). Although initial evidence suggested that preview benefit does not reflect processing of word meaning (Rayner, Balota, & Pollatsek, 1986; Rayner, Schotter, & Drieghe, 2014), more recent evidence indicates that some aspects of the upcoming word’s meaning are processed under certain conditions (Hohenstein & Kliegl, 2014; Rayner & Schotter, 2014; Schotter, 2013; Schotter, Lee, Reiderman, & Rayner, 2015). Finally, research using the boundary paradigm has demonstrated that readers typically do not obtain information from the second word to the right of the fixated word (e.g., Angele & Rayner, 2011; Rayner, Juhasz, & Brown, 2007) unless the two words following the fixated word are short (i.e., close to the fovea), common, and/or predictable (Cutter, Drieghe, & Liversedge, 2014; Radach, Inhoff, Glover, & Vorstius, 2013). If observed, preview benefits from the second word to the right of the fixated word are typically smaller in magnitude than preview benefits from the word immediately following the fixated word. The findings from both the moving-window paradigm and the boundary paradigm are quite consistent with the research we discussed earlier regarding the limitations on reading and the fact that people need to move their eyes so as to place the fovea over the region that they want to process. That is, they suggest that people need to move their eyes to look at words directly in order to read efficiently. These findings do not align with some of the central claims of speed-reading courses, such as that readers can obtain information from a large area of text in a single fixation. Nor do they align with the claims of some speed-reading technologies, such as that reading will be more efficient if words are presented one at a time, without the opportunity for parafoveal preview. Reading speed across people Is there variability in reading speed? Unsurprisingly, reading speed varies greatly among individuals (Rayner, 1998; see Table 1), most notably as a function of reading skill: Fast readers make shorter fixations, longer saccades, and fewer regressions than slow readers (Everatt & Underwood, 1994; G. Underwood, Hubbard, & Wilkinson, 1990; see Everatt, Bradshaw, & Hibbard, 1998). Importantly, in a study that examined a large number of cognitive skills, the factor that most strongly determined reading speed was word-identification ability (Kuperman & Van Dyke, 2011). This finding suggests that reading speed is intimately tied to language-processing abilities rather than eye movement–control abilities.","completion":"شکل 9. نمودار پارادایم مرزی. خط چین عمودی محل مرز را نمایش می‌دهد که در آزمایش نامرئی است. زمانی که نگاه خواننده (که توسط دایره‌های خاکستری نشان داده شده) از این محل، بین سومین خط از آخر و دومین خط از آخر، عبور می‌کند، کلمه پیش‌نمایش (\\"kfevl\\"، در این مثال) به کلمه هدف (\\"front\\") تغییر می‌کند. یافته‌های کلی از مطالعاتی که از پارادایم مرزی استفاده می‌کنند این است که خوانندگان از پیش‌نمایش پارافوویال سود می‌برند. یعنی، آن‌ها سریع‌تر کلمه هدف را می‌خوانند وقتی پیش‌نمایش یکسان با کلمه هدف بوده تا وقتی پیش‌نمایش با کلمه هدف متفاوت است (برای مطالعه کلی، ببینید شوتر، آنجله، و راینر، 2012). پارادایم مرزی به محققان اجازه می‌دهد که طبیعت رابطه بین پیش‌نمایش و هدف را دستکاری کنند تا اطلاعات دقیق‌تری درباره دقیقاً چه نوع اطلاعاتی باعث فایده پیش‌نمایش می‌شود کسب کنند. اکنون به مطالعاتی که این مسئله را بررسی کرده‌اند، که در زمینه فناوری‌های خواندن سریع که یک کلمه در یک بار ارائه می‌دهند و فرصتی برای پیش‌نمایش پارافوویال اجازه نمی‌دهند، می‌پردازیم. خوانندگان از ورودی چیزی فراتر از ویژگی‌های بصری خالص به دست می‌آورند. این با حیله‌گری توسط مک‌کانکی و زولا (1979) که خوانندگان را یاد دادند متن‌هایی شبیه به \\"AlTeRnAtInG cAsE\\" بخوانند و سپس یا حروف مورد نظر را تغییر دادند (که متن را \\"aLtErNaTiNg CaSe\\" خوانده شود) و یا حروف را در طی یک ساکاد تغییر نداده‌اند، نشان داده شد. تغییر حالت حروف هیچ تأثیری بر مدت تثبیت‌ها نداشت، نشان‌دهنده اینکه خوانندگان شکل دقیق بصری حروف را کنار گذاشته بودند و رفتار خواندن‌شان بر اساس کدهای حرفی انتزاعی بود (یعنی هویت حروف؛ همچنین ببینید فریدمن، 1980؛ راینر، مک‌کانکی، و زولا، 1980؛ اسلتری و غیره، 2011). اما فراتر از هویت حروف، شواهد فراوانی وجود دارد که خوانندگان سریع‌تر یک کلمه هدف را می‌خوانند وقتی پیش‌نمایش فونولوژیکی با آن مرتبط بوده است. این صادق است برای خوانندگان سیستم‌های نوشتاری الفبایی مثل انگلیسی (پولاتسک، لش، موریس، و راینر، 1992) و فرانسه (اسپارو و میلت، 2002) و همچنین سیستم‌های غیر الفبایی مثل چینی (پولاتسک، تان، و راینر، 2000). هرچند شواهد اولیه پیشنهاد کردند که فایده پیش‌نمایش بازتاب پردازش معنای کلمه نمی‌کند (راینر، بالوتا، و پولاتسک، 1986؛ راینر، شوتر، و دریگه، 2014)، شواهد اخیر نشان می‌دهند که برخی جنبه‌های معنای کلمه آینده تحت شرایط خاص پردازش می‌شوند (هوهنشتاین و کلیگل، 2014؛ راینر و شوتر، 2014؛ شوتر، 2013؛ شوتر، لی، رایدرمن، و راینر، 2015). سرانجام، تحقیق با استفاده از پارادایم مرزی نشان داده‌است که خوانندگان معمولاً اطلاعاتی از دومین کلمه به سمت راست کلمه تثبیت‌شده دریافت نمی‌کنند (مثلاً آنجله و راینر، 2011؛ راینر، یوهاز، و براون، 2007) مگر اینکه دو کلمه دنبال‌کننده کلمه تثبیت‌شده کوتاه (یعنی نزدیک به فوویا)، رایج و / یا قابل پیش‌بینی باشند (کاتر، دریغه، و لیورسج، 2014؛ راداخ، اینهوف، گلاور، و فورستیوس، 2013). اگر مشاهده شود، فایده‌های پیش‌نمایش از دومین کلمه به سمت راست کلمه تثبیت‌شده معمولاً کوچکتر از فایده‌های پیش‌نمایش از کلمه فوراً دنبال‌کننده کلمه‌ی تثبیت‌شده هستند. یافته‌ها از هر دو پارادایم پنجره متحرک و مرزی بسیار مطابق با تحقیقی است که قبلاً در مورد محدودیت‌های خواندن و نیاز مردم به حرکت دادن چشم‌هایشان برای قرار دادن فوویا روی منطقه‌ای که می‌خواهند پردازش کنند، بحث کردیم. یعنی، آن‌ها نشان می‌دهند که مردم باید چشم‌ها را حرکت دهند تا به طور مستقیم به کلمات نگاه کنند تا به طور مؤثر بخوانند. این یافته‌ها با برخی از ادعاهای مرکزی دوره‌های خواندن سریع همخوانی ندارد، مثل اینکه خوانندگان می‌توانند اطلاعات را از منطقه بزرگی از متن در یک تثبیت دریافت کنند. همچنین با ادعاهای برخی از فناوری‌های خواندن سریع همخوانی ندارد، مانند اینکه خواندن مؤثرتر خواهد بود اگر کلمات یکی در میان، بدون فرصت برای پیش‌نمایش پارافوویال، ارائه شوند. سرعت خواندن در بین افراد آیا تغییراتی در سرعت خواندن وجود دارد؟ از نظر غیرمنتظره، سرعت خواندن بین افراد به شدت متفاوت است (راینر، 1998؛ ببینید جدول 1)، بیش‌تر به عنوان تابعی از مهارت خواندن: خوانندگان سریع‌تر تثبیت‌های کوتاه‌تر، ساکادهای طولانی‌تر و بازگشت‌های کم‌تری نسبت به خوانندگان آهسته دارند (اورت و آندروود، 1994؛ آندروود، هوبارد، و ویلکسون، 1990؛ ببینید اورت، بردشاو، و هیبارد، 1998). مهم است که در مطالعه‌ای که تعداد زیادی از مهارت‌های شناختی را بررسی کرد، عاملی که به شدت‌ترین سرعت خواندن را تعیین کرد، توانایی شناسایی کلمه بود (کوپرمن و ون دایک، 2011). این یافته نشان می‌دهد که سرعت خواندن به شدت به توانایی‌های پردازش زبانی بستگی دارد تا توانایی‌های کنترل حرکت چشم."},{"prompt":"and this please: Table 1.

Rayner, 1998, Psychological Bulletin, 124, p. 393. Copyright 1998 by the American Psychological Association. Adapted with permission. Models of eye movement control While we have learned a great deal about eye movements and reading over the past few decades, there are still some open questions. However, the research that has been done so far has provided such a detailed understanding that researchers have been able to develop sophisticated models of eye movements during reading. These models are computer programs that do a very good job of predicting how long readers will look at words and where they will move their eyes next. There are a number of such models (see Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), but two have received the most attention: the E-Z Reader model (Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998) and the SWIFT model (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005). Although a full discussion of these models is beyond the scope of the present article, the most important point for present purposes is that, in the models, word identification is a primary determiner of when and where readers move their eyes. We do not set an unchanging pace and length for eye movements in advance of reading a text. Rather, we vary our pace and our movements depending on our ongoing cognitive processes: how well we are processing the incoming information. A second important point is that, in adapting such models to account for the development of reading skill in children, the parameters that need to be modified are those associated with language-processing ability rather than those that specify eye movement–control ability (Reichle et al., 2013). This finding from the modeling work further supports the idea that language processing, rather than the ability to control the movements of one’s eyes, is the primary driver of reading performance. Given this, we now turn to an overview of one major aspect of language processing: word recognition, and its role in reading. Word recognition Reading obviously consists of more than recognizing individual words. But, given that a writing system represents the words of a language, words are the basic stepping-stones to reading and comprehension. You cannot reasonably expect to understand a text if you do not know what the words mean (imagine trying to read an unfamiliar language). In this section, we detail what is known about word recognition. One of the biggest influences on the time that it takes to recognize a word is its frequency of occurrence—essentially, how often the word has been encountered before (Rayner, 1998, 2009). In reading, as in listening, words that are more common (e.g., house) require less time to recognize than words that are less common (e.g., abode). The effects of word frequency can be thought of as operating through practice or experience; the more times you have encountered and recognized a word, the easier it will be for you to do it again in the future. The word-frequency effect can be demonstrated for written words seen in isolation by measuring reaction time in tasks such as the lexical decision task (Stanners, Jastrzembski, & Westbrook, 1975), the naming task (Berry, 1971; Forster & Chambers, 1973), and the categorization task (Van Orden, 1987). These tasks are depicted in Figure 10. In a lexical decision task, words and nonwords are briefly presented on a computer screen and the participant’s goal is to determine whether each letter string is a word or not. In a naming task, the goal is to read the word aloud as quickly and as accurately as possible. In the categorization task, the goal is to determine whether the word is a member of a certain semantic category—for example, the category of foods. For words embedded in passages of text, the frequency effect can be measured by examining eye fixation times during silent reading (Rayner & Duffy, 1986) or event-related brain potentials (ERPs; King & Kutas, 1998) during the reading of words presented one at a time via RSVP. During silent reading and RSVP, the participant’s goal is to understand the sentence in order to recall the text or to answer comprehension questions about it. Despite these differences in the requirements or goals of the tasks (e.g., determining word status, accessing pronunciation, or accessing meaning), the frequency effect is apparent across all of them (although the magnitude of the effect changes depending on the task; Schotter, Bicknell, Howard, Levy, & Rayner, 2014). Thus, it is a ubiquitous and robust influence on the word-recognition process.","completion":"توجه: برگرفته از \\"حرکات چشم در خواندن و پردازش اطلاعات: 20 سال تحقیقات\\"، توسط کی. راینر، 1998، بولتن روان‌شناسی، 124، ص. 393. کپی رایت 1998 توسط انجمن روان‌شناسی آمریکا. با اجازه بازچاپ شده است. مدل‌های کنترل حرکت چشم در حالی که ما در دهه‌های گذشته اطلاعات زیادی درباره حرکات چشم و خواندن کسب کرده‌ایم، هنوز برخی سوالات باز هستند. با این حال، تحقیقاتی که تاکنون انجام شده است درکی به قدر زیاد جزئی فراهم آورده که محققان توانسته‌اند مدل‌های پیچیده‌ای از حرکات چشم در حین خواندن توسعه دهند. این مدل‌ها برنامه‌های کامپیوتری هستند که کار بسیار خوبی در پیش‌بینی انجام می‌دهند که چقدر طول می‌کشد خوانندگان به کلمات نگاه کنند و کجا چشم‌های خود را بعدی حرکت دهند. تعدادی از این مدل‌ها وجود دارند (نگاه کنید به رایشل، راینر، و پولاتسک، 2003)، اما دوتا از آن‌ها بیشترین توجه را به خود جلب کرده‌اند: مدل E-Z Reader (رایشل، پولاتسک، فیشر، و راینر، 1998) و مدل SWIFT (انگبرت، نوثمن، ریشتر، و کلیگل، 2005). اگرچه بحث کامل درباره این مدل‌ها فراتر از حوصله این مقاله است، مهم‌ترین نکته برای اهداف حاضر این است که در مدل‌ها، شناسایی کلمات به‌عنوان تعیین‌کننده اصلی زمان و مکان حرکت چشم خوانندگان است. ما تنظیمی ثابت و طولی برای حرکات چشم پیش از خواندن یک متن ایجاد نمی‌کنیم. بلکه ما سرعت و حرکات خود را بسته به فرآیندهای شناختی جاری خود تغییر می‌دهیم: چه‌قدر خوب اطلاعات ورودی را پردازش می‌کنیم. نکته مهم دیگر این است که، در تطبیق این مدل‌ها برای حساب کردن توسعه مهارت خواندن در کودکان، پارامترهایی که نیاز به تعدیل دارند آن‌هایی هستند که با توانایی پردازش زبانی مرتبط هستند تا آن‌هایی که توانایی کنترل حرکت چشمی را مشخص می‌کنند (رایشل و غیره، 2013). این یافته از کار مدل‌سازی بیش‌تر ایده‌ای را که پردازش زبان، تا توانایی کنترل حرکت چشم‌های خود را، به‌عنوان عامل اصلی عملکرد خواندن است، تایید می‌کند. با توجه به این موضوع، اکنون به بررسی اجمالی یک جنبه بزرگ پردازش زبان می‌پردازیم: شناسایی کلمات، و نقش آن در خواندن. شناسایی کلمات خواندن واضحاً شامل چیزهای بیش از شناسایی کلمات انفرادی است. اما، از آنجا که یک سیستم نوشتاری کلمات یک زبان را نشان می‌دهد، کلمات سنگ‌بنای اصلی برای خواندن و درک مطلب هستند. نمی‌توانید منطقاً انتظار داشته باشید که یک متن را درک کنید اگر معنای کلمات را ندانید (تصور کنید که سعی دارید به یک زبان ناشناخته بخوانید). در این بخش، ما به جزئیات آنچه در مورد شناسایی کلمات شناخته شده است می‌پردازیم. یکی از بزرگ‌ترین نفوذها بر زمانی که لازم است برای شناسایی یک کلمه، فراوانی رخداد آن است - یعنی، چند بار کلمه پیش از این مواجه شده است (راینر، 1998، 2009). در خواندن، همان‌طور که در شنیدن، کلماتی که رایج‌ترند (مثل house) زمان کم‌تری برای شناسایی نسبت به کلماتی که کمتر رایج‌اند (مثل abode) نیاز دارند. تأثیرات فراوانی کلمات می‌توانند به عنوان آمالی از طریق تمرین یا تجربه در نظر گرفته شوند؛ هر چه بیش‌تر بارها کلمه را مواجه و شناسایی کرده‌اید، برای شما آسان‌تر خواهد بود که باز در آینده آن‌ را انجام دهید. تأثیر فراوانی کلمه می‌تواند برای کلمات نوشتاری دیده‌شده در انزوا با اندازه‌گیری زمان واکنش در کارهایی مثل وظیفه تصمیم لغوی (استنرز، یاسترمبسکی، و وستبروک، 1975)، وظیفه نام‌گذاری (بری، 1971؛ فورستر و چمبرز، 1973)، و وظیفه طبقه‌بندی (ون اوردن، 1987) نمایش داده شود. این کارها در شکل 10 به تصویر کشیده شده‌اند. در وظیفه تصمیم لغوی، کلمات و غیر کلمات به طور کوتاه در یک صفحه کامپیوتری نمایش داده می‌شوند و هدف شرکت‌کننده تعیین چه‌چیزی از هر رشته حرف کلمه است یا نه. در وظیفه نام‌گذاری، هدف خواندن کلمه به صورت بلند و به دقیق‌ترین روش ممکن است. در وظیفه طبقه‌بندی، هدف تعیین کردن این است که کلمه عضو یک دسته بندی معینی است یا خیر - برای مثال، دسته غذاها. برای کلماتی که در متون به صورت متن جاسازی شده‌اند، تأثیر فراوانی می‌تواند با مشاهده زمان‌های تثبیت چشمی در طول خواندن بی‌صدا (راینر و دافی، 1986) یا پتانسیل‌های مرتبط با رویداد مغزی (ERPs؛ کینگ و کوتس، 1998) در طول خواندن کلماتی که یکی پس از دیگری از طریق RSVP ارائه می‌شوند، اندازه‌گیری شود. در طول خواندن بی‌صدا و RSVP، هدف شرکت‌کننده فهمیدن جمله است تا متن را به خاطر بسپارد یا به سوالات فهمیدنی درباره آن پاسخ دهد. با وجود این تفاوت‌ها در نیازها یا اهداف کارها (مثلاً تعیین وضعیت کلمه، دسترسی به تلفظ، یا دسترسی به معنی)، تأثیر فراوانی در تمام آنها واضح است (با اینکه میزان تأثیر با توجه به کار تغییر می‌کند؛ شوتر، بیکنل، هوارد، لِوی، و راینر، 2014). بنابراین، این یک تأثیر همه‌جا حاضر و محکم بر فرایند شناسایی کلمه است."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 10.

For the lexical decision task, in which the goal is to decide if the letter string is a word or nonword, the top panel shows a nonword trial and the bottom panel shows a word trial. For the naming task, the goal is to read aloud the word. For the categorization task, in which the goal is to decide if the word fits into a given category (e.g., “foods”), the top panel shows an item that fits the category and the bottom panel shows an item that does not. From letters to words Recognizing a word, in an alphabetic writing system, involves processing the letters within it. As we discussed earlier, the letters in the words of alphabetic writing systems symbolize the sounds that are used to pronounce the word, and the pronunciation is in turn associated with a meaning. We now turn to the question of how people recognize the individual letters within the word and retrieve the pronunciation and meaning. For most words, including short and medium-sized ones, all of the letters within the word are recognized simultaneously. For very long words such as antidisestablishmentarianism, it may not be possible to recognize all the letters simultaneously (recall that the size of the word-identification span is only about 7 letters to the right of eye fixation in English). These words require multiple fixations in order to be recognized. Simultaneous recognition of letters is more efficient within words that are well known than words that are completely new to the reader. In fact, it is actually easier to recognize a letter inside a known word than it is to identify it in isolation! This effect, termed the word-superiority effect, was discovered over 125 years ago by Cattell (1886) and later confirmed with more rigorous methods by Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Experiments demonstrating this effect have used the general design that is shown in Figure 11.","completion":"شکل 10. نموداری از سه وظیفه معمول برای مطالعه خواندن کلمات. برای وظیفه تصمیم لغوی که هدف تصمیم‌گیری درباره‌ی اینکه آیا رشته حروف یک کلمه یا غیر کلمه است، پانل بالا یک آزمون غیر کلمه و پانل پایین یک آزمون کلمه را نشان می‌دهد. برای وظیفه نام‌گذاری، هدف خواندن بلند کلمه است. برای وظیفه طبقه‌بندی که هدف تصمیم‌گیری در این است که آیا کلمه مناسب دسته‌ای (مانند \\"غذاها\\") است، پانل بالا یک آیتم که مناسب دسته است و پانل پایین نشان‌دهنده‌ی آیتمی است که مناسب دسته نیست. از حروف تا کلمات شناسایی یک کلمه، در یک سیستم نوشتاری الفبایی، شامل پردازش حروف درون آن می‌شود. همان‌طور که قبلا بحث کردیم، حروف در کلمات سیستم‌های نوشتاری الفبایی نمادهایی از صداهایی هستند که برای تلفظ کلمه استفاده می‌شوند، و تلفظ به نوبه‌ی خود با معنی‌ای مرتبط است. حالا ما به سوال اینکه چگونه مردم حروف فردی درون کلمه را تشخیص می‌دهند و تلفظ و معنی را استخراج می‌کنند، می‌پردازیم. برای بیشتر کلمات، از جمله کوتاه‌ها و متوسط‌ها، تمامی حروف درون کلمه به صورت همزمان شناسایی می‌شوند. برای کلمات بسیار طولانی مانند antidisestablishmentarianism، شناسایی همزمان تمام حروف شاید امکان‌پذیر نباشد (به یاد داشته باشید که اندازه محدوده شناسایی کلمه فقط حدود 7 حروف به راست تثبیت چشم در انگلیسی است). این کلمات نیاز به چندین تثبیت دارند تا شناسایی شوند. تشخیص همزمان حروف در کلماتی که به خوبی شناخته شده‌اند، نسبت به کلماتی که برای خواننده کاملاً جدید هستند، کارآمدتر است. در واقع، شناسایی یک حرف درون یک کلمه شناخته‌شده آسان‌تر از تشخیص آن به صورت انفرادی است! این اثر، که به اثر برتری کلمه معروف است، بیش از 125 سال پیش توسط کتل (1886) کشف شد و بعداً با روش‌های دقیق‌تر توسط رایشر (1969) و ویلر (1970) تأیید شد. آزمایش‌هایی که این اثر را نشان داده‌اند از طراحی کلی استفاده می‌کنند که در شکل 11 نشان داده شده‌اند."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 11. Diagram of the paradigm used by Cattell (1886), Reicher (1969), and Wheeler (1970) to demonstrate the word-superiority effect. From top to bottom, the first three panels show successive displays in the experiment. The pair of panels at the bottom show the participant’s potential responses. A person sees either a word (e.g., “word”), a nonword with the same letters in a jumbled order (e.g., “orwd”), or a single letter (e.g., “d”) presented very briefly on a computer screen—so briefly that there is not enough time to make an eye movement. Next, a mask stimulus (e.g., “”) replaces the initial stimulus, barring the person from holding onto the information about the word, nonword, or letter in any type of raw visual form. The person is cued to a particular position in the stimulus (e.g., the last position) and asked to report which of two possible letters had been presented at that location (e.g., “d” or “k”). Note that in this example (and for all the items in Reicher’s and Wheeler’s experiments), either of the response options in the word condition would make a real word (i.e., either word or work). This means that using knowledge about what letters would make the letter string form a word in English could not help a person perform above the level of chance, which is 50%. But performance in the word condition is much better than chance and much better than in either the nonword condition or (quite surprisingly!) the isolated-letter condition. Even more impressive than the word-superiority effect is the fact that, once established, the word-recognition system is so efficient that it can interfere with processes that seem to be very basic, such as color recognition. The clearest demonstration of this is the Stroop effect, named after the scientist who discovered it (Stroop, 1935) and replicated hundreds of times since (see MacLeod, 1991, for a review). This effect is so robust that it can be demonstrated easily in classrooms with a single piece of paper and a timer. In the Stroop task, the goal is to name the color of the ink in which each word is printed as fast and as accurately as possible—you can try it yourself by using Figure 12. Start with the first column and time yourself. Then try the second column, and then try the third. You may notice that each column feels more difficult than the last and takes you more time. This is because when the word names a color that is different from the color you are trying to say, as in the third column, you have difficulty selecting the correct response. You do not experience such competition in the first column (because the word and ink color lead to the same response) or in the second column (because the string of x’s does not bring a particular word to mind).","completion":"شکل 11. نمودار پارادایم مورد استفاده توسط کتل (1886)، رایشر (1969)، و ویلر (1970) برای نمایش اثر برتری کلمه. از بالا به پایین، سه پانل اول نمایش های متوالی در آزمایش را نشان می‌دهند. جفت پانل‌ها در پایین پاسخ‌های بالقوه شرکت‌کننده را نشان می‌دهند. فرد یا یک کلمه (مثلاً \\"word\\")، یک غیرکلمه با همان حروف به ترتیب درهم ریخته (مثلاً \\"orwd\\")، یا یک حرف انفرادی (مثلاً \\"d\\") را برای مدتی بسیار کوتاه بر روی صفحه کامپیوتر مشاهده می‌کند - به اندازه‌ای کوتاه که زمان کافی برای انجام یک حرکت چشمی نیست. سپس، یک محرک ماسک (مثلاً \\"\\") جایگزین محرک اولیه می‌شود که مانع از نگه داشتن اطلاعات در مورد کلمه، غیرکلمه یا حرف به هر نوع شکل بصری خام می‌شود. از فرد خواسته می‌شود به موقعیت خاصی در محرک کوه شود (مثلاً موقعیت آخر) و گزارش دهد که کدام یک از دو حرف بالقوه در آن محل ارائه شده‌اند (مثلاً \\"d\\" یا \\"k\\"). توجه داشته باشید که در این مثال (و برای همه موارد در آزمایشات رایشر و ویلر)، هر یک از گزینه‌های پاسخ در شرایط کلمه یک کلمه واقعی را تشکیل می‌دهند (یعنی یا کلمه \\"word\\" یا کلمه \\"work\\"). این بدان معناست که استفاده از دانش درباره چه حروفی که یک رشته حرف را به یک کلمه در انگلیسی تبدیل می‌کنند، نمی‌تواند به فرد کمک کند تا بالاتر از سطح شانس، که 50٪ است، عمل کند. اما عملکرد در شرایط کلمه بسیار بهتر از شانس و بسیار بهتر از هر دو شرایط غیرکلمه یا (به طور شگفت‌انگیز!) شرایط حرف انفرادی است. حتی قابل توجه‌تر از اثر برتری کلمه این واقعیت است که، پس از برقراری، سیستم شناسایی کلمه به قدری کارآمد است که می‌تواند با فرایندهایی که به نظر بسیار ابتدایی هستند، مانند شناخت رنگ، تداخل کند. واضح‌ترین نمایش این موضوع اثر استروپ است، نام‌گذاری شده بعد از دانشمندی که آن را کشف کرد (استروپ، 1935) و از آن زمان صدها بار تکرار شده است (مک‌لیود، 1991 را برای یک مرور ببینید). این اثر به قدری قوی است که به راحتی در کلاس‌های درسی با یک تکه کاغذ و یک تایمر اثبات می‌شود. در وظیفه استروپ، هدف نام‌گذاری رنگ جوهر که هر کلمه با آن چاپ شده است به سرعت و دقت‌ترین روش ممکن است - می‌توانید خودتان این کار را با استفاده از شکل 12 امتحان کنید. با ستون اول شروع کنید و خودتان را زمان‌بندی کنید. سپس ستون دوم را امتحان کنید، و بعد ستون سوم را امتحان کنید. ممکن است متوجه شوید که هر ستون دشوارتر از آخرین به نظر می‌رسد و به شما زمان بیشتری می‌برد. این به این دلیل است که وقتی کلمه نام یک رنگ را نام می‌برد که متفاوت از رنگی است که شما سعی دارید بگویید، مانند ستون سوم، شما در انتخاب پاسخ صحیح دشواری دارید. شما در ستون اول (زیرا کلمه و رنگ جوهر منجر به یک پاسخ مشابه می‌شوند) یا در ستون دوم (زیرا رشته xها کلمه خاصی را به ذهن نمی‌آورند) چنین رقابتی را تجربه نمی‌کنید."},{"prompt":"and this please: Fig. 12. Example stimuli in the Stroop paradigm. The task is to name the color of the ink that the word is printed in as quickly and accurately as possible. Column 1 shows stimuli in the congruent condition (each word names the color in which it is printed), Column 2 shows stimuli in the neutral condition (each stimulus is a colored string of x’s), and Column 3 shows stimuli in the incongruent condition (the words name colors different from the colors they are printed in). What is so surprising about this effect, besides how robust and easily demonstrated it is, is that we would generally think that color naming should be so easy that the words should be irrelevant—recall that the cones (photoreceptors in your eye) are specifically tuned to detect color. In fact, some recently developed speed-reading apps that use color claim “Ever wonder why stop lights use color and not words? It’s because the human brain processes color very quickly—much more quickly than it can process words” (http://www.beelinereader.com/). The Stroop effect suggests that it might not be as simple as that; once a reader is proficient in a language (this effect does not appear when the words are printed in a language the person does not know), word recognition is so incredibly quick and strong that it can interfere with retrieval of a competing word—the name of the color. The optimal viewing position effect It is important to note that, with the Stroop effect, the interference created by a mismatch between the word name and the ink color is strongest when people are looking at the center of the word than when they are fixating more peripheral letters (Perret & Ducrot, 2010). This is important because of another robustly demonstrated effect—the optimal viewing position (OVP) effect—in which words that are presented in isolation are recognized more efficiently when people are looking in the center of the word than when they are looking at more external letters (O’Regan, Lévy-Schoen, Pynte, & Brugaillère, 1984). Although this effect is consistently obtained for single-word presentations, it is small, on the order of only a few milliseconds. It is even smaller during natural reading of text (Vitu, O’Regan, & Mittau, 1990), probably because of the ability to obtain parafoveal preview that we discussed earlier. This will become an important point later when we talk about some recent speed-reading technologies that present words centered near the OVP. The claim is that this is done because people cannot recognize a word until they fixate the OVP. The research shows, however, that people are not incapable of recognizing words if they do not fixate the OVP; instead, the recognition process is just slightly slowed. The role of phonology in silent reading Given that all writing systems represent words and given that the primary form of language is vocal and auditory, not visual, it is no surprise that phonological processing plays an important role in reading—even in silent reading (see Leinenger, 2014). This is true not only for alphabetic writing systems, in which letters represent the individual phonemes in words, but also for non-alphabetic writing systems such as Chinese. We will now describe a number of studies showing that readers naturally access the sounds of words while reading silently and that attempts to inhibit this process generally have negative effects on reading. These studies are important to examine in light of the speed-reading claim that use of inner speech causes problems for readers. First, consider a study in which skilled readers were asked to indicate (with a button press) whether briefly presented words were members of a certain category (e.g., foods; Van Orden, 1987). The people in this study incorrectly responded “yes” to a word that was not a member of the category (e.g., meet for the category food) about 19% of the time if that word was a homophone of a true member of the category: In this example, meet is pronounced the same as meat, which is a food. Incorrect “yes” responses to non-homophone words—for example, melt—occurred only 3% of the time. This is because while melt shares the same number of letters with meat as meet does, it does not share the pronunciation. When people did correctly respond that, for example, meet is not a food, it took them longer to do so than it did for melt. These results suggest that people accessed the sounds of the word and were strongly influenced by the fact that its phonological code was identical to that of an actual member of the category. Readers of Chinese also activate the sounds of words when they read (Xu, Pollatsek, & Potter, 1999), although Chinese is not an alphabetic writing system. Studies using homophones have also found evidence for inner speech during silent reading of text. For example, when people were asked to read silently and make very quick judgments about whether sentences made sense, they incorrectly accepted a sentence like “She has blonde hare” about 12% of the time, more often than they incorrectly accepted a sentence like “She has blonde harm” (about 5% of the time; Treiman, Freyd, & Baron, 1983). If use of phonology were an unimportant process that readers could easily turn off, we would have expected them to do so. The fact that they could not suggests that phonology is fundamental to the process of reading. What would happen if we eliminated inner speech during reading? It is difficult to design a procedure that prevents people from performing a mental activity, but researchers have tried two approaches. One approach is to use biofeedback techniques to get people to reduce the activity that sometimes occurs in their speech muscles while they are reading silently. In one study, a tone was played when a monitor picked up such activity and readers were instructed to keep the tone off (Hardyck & Petrinovich, 1970). Readers were able to keep the tone off to some extent, and their performance on a later comprehension test was unaffected if the text was easy but was impaired if the text was more difficult. This effect did not just seem to reflect the added complexity of reading while listening for a tone, because comprehension did not suffer in a group of participants whose arm muscle activity was monitored in a similar way. Another way to try to decrease the use of inner speech during silent reading is to have people count aloud or repeat an irrelevant word or phrase while they are reading (Daneman & Newson, 1992). In such studies, readers showed poorer comprehension of passages when they repeated the irrelevant words, but not when they repeated an irrelevant sequence of taps with their fingers. This latter result suggests that it was speech, rather than the requirement to perform two tasks, that impaired reading comprehension. In another study in which people repeated irrelevant speech while reading silently, readers were quite good at answering comprehension questions about individual concepts but were worse at answering questions that required them to combine concepts and make inferences (Slowiaczek & Clifton, 1980). These findings support the idea that, when it comes to understanding complex materials, inner speech is not a nuisance activity that must be eliminated, as many speed-reading proponents suggest. Rather, translating visual information into phonological form, a basic form of language, helps readers to understand it. Word-recognition models Earlier, we discussed how researchers have developed detailed models of eye movement control. There are also detailed models of the word-recognition process. The models that have received the most attention and motivated the most research are the dual-route cascaded (DRC) model (e.g., Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001) and parallel distributed processing (PDP) models, also called connectionist or triangle models (e.g., Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989). The models disagree on some points, showing that scientists still have things to learn about the process of recognizing words. However, there are some important areas of agreement. For one, the models share the basic assumption that bottom-up orthographic input interacts with what people know about words to produce pronunciations and meanings. That is, both detailed visual information from the text and prior experience with the language are necessary. Another area of agreement between models of word recognition is that internal representations of phonology play a role in the recognition of words that are presented visually and not pronounced aloud by the reader. The role of context in selecting the correct word meaning In some cases, a word has two separate meanings but the same spelling and the same pronunciation. An example of such a homograph is bank, which can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. Lexical ambiguity of this sort complicates word recognition. Lexical ambiguity is not rare—the English language contains over 1,500 homographs (Leinenger & Rayner, 2013)—and it may even be a desirable feature of language because it allows us to reuse word forms for multiple purposes instead of creating new, increasingly large and complex words (Piantadosi, Tily, & Gibson, 2012). Still, difficulty arises because merely knowing the word’s visual form and pronunciation does not indicate which of the two meanings the reader should interpret. When a homograph is encountered in isolation, it is impossible to discern its intended meaning. Luckily, readers usually have the benefit of a sentence context that can give them clues as to which meaning they should interpret. For example, it would be easy to infer that bank means “financial institution” when it is preceded by “John went to deposit some money at the . . .” In contrast, you might be more likely to infer that it means “side of a river” if it were preceded by “John went to sail a boat at the river . . .” In this example, the information that helps distinguish the meaning of bank comes before the word itself. But sometimes the disambiguating information appears after the word. In these situations, readers are less likely to make the correct initial interpretation. Rather, readers tend to make regressions back to the word if they had initially misinterpreted it (e.g., Duffy, Morris, & Rayner, 1988; Rayner & Duffy, 1986). Difficulty or uncertainty discerning exact word meaning can also arise when word forms are visually very similar, as with orthographic-substitution neighbors (e.g., birch and birth) and transposition-letter neighbors (e.g., calm and clam). The likelihood that the word will be misinterpreted is higher if the correct word is rare and the highly similar word is more common. Context can help readers in such cases; readers have an easier time recognizing the correct word (as opposed to the visually similar word) when the preceding sentence context indicates the correct meaning (Johnson, 2009; Slattery, 2009). Sentence context also helps readers with words that are neither homographs nor neighbors of another word, indicating that the effect is fairly general. For example, a constraining context, one that makes a particular word predictable, leads to that word’s being fixated less often (i.e., skipped more) and for less time than if it were preceded by a neutral context that could be completed by a wide range of words (Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Zola, 1984; see Rayner, 1998, 2009, for reviews). A constraining context also speeds response time in naming (Stanovich & West, 1979, 1981; West & Stanovich, 1982) and lexical decision tasks (Schuberth & Eimas, 1977) and affects the brain’s response to words as measured with ERPs (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). The findings about the importance of context in visual word recognition suggest that training courses that teach students not to reread and speed-reading devices that do not allow for going back will make readers more likely to misinterpret words when they occur in less constraining contexts. Comprehension Given that reading typically progresses rather smoothly, we may not notice the subtle complexities that are associated with understanding the meaning of a text. We have already mentioned that some words are ambiguous because they have multiple meanings. Sentences also can be ambiguous in that it is not always obvious how each individual word in a given sentence functions and relates to the other words (i.e., the sentence’s syntax). Consider the sentence “While Mary was mending the sock fell off her lap.” When reading a sentence like this, readers often initially misinterpret it (the term for this is getting garden pathed; see Frazier & Rayner, 1982; Rayner, Carlson, & Frazier, 1983). This happens because readers, like listeners, tend to process words incrementally, as soon as they have identified them. They often assume at first that “the sock” is the object of “was mending” (i.e., that what Mary was mending was the sock). Of course, after reading the end of the sentence, it is clear that that interpretation could not possibly be correct (if so, then what fell off her lap?). In reality, the sentence should be interpreted such that “the sock fell off her lap” is a sentence unit (a constituent) and that Mary was mending something that was not stated in the text. When we introduce this idea and these types of sentences to students in the classroom, they often note that ambiguity could be avoided if the writer simply put a comma after “was mending” to disambiguate the sentence by separating the two constituents. One might argue that good copy editors would not let such a sentence occur and that such poorly written sentences should be rare. However, the comma is indeed optional in English grammar and writers (and speakers) are not very good at anticipating whether readers (or listeners) are likely to misinterpret what they write (or say; Ferreira & Schotter, 2013). Therefore, garden-path sentences like this occur much more often than one might imagine (they are quite notorious for occurring in newspaper headlines; e.g., “McDonald’s fries the holy grail for potato farmers”: Crash Blossoms Up the Garden Path, 2009). Further complicating the process of understanding sentences is that words can be ambiguous with respect to their grammatical role—that is, their part of speech. In the garden-path example we have been discussing, the problem in interpreting the sentence is not due to difficulty discerning the meaning of the individual words but rather to difficulty deciding whether Mary was mending the sock or whether the sock fell. Add to that ambiguity the difficulty of deciding whether a word itself means one idea or another and you find yourself in a very difficult situation. For example, consider a sentence that begins, “The desert trains . . .” With only these words, you will not be able to figure out how this phrase should be interpreted until you get more information from the rest of the sentence. Context would help you determine whether those words should be interpreted as a noun and verb (i.e., “The desert trains boys to be men”) or an adjective and a noun (i.e., “The desert trains are hot and dusty”). The information that would help you understand the roles and meanings of “desert trains” occurs after the ambiguous phrase. When you first encounter the words “desert trains,” you must make a best guess as to how to understand them. When your first guess at an interpretation is wrong, then you run into problems. In these situations, readers fix the problem by making regressions and rereading the sentence (or parts thereof) in order to find the correct interpretation (Frazier & Rayner, 1987). Fixing comprehension failure The examples we have been discussing show that discourse can sometimes contain syntactic ambiguities and it is only via careful reading that the reader will be able to appreciate the appropriate meaning. Readers are often able to fix comprehension problems by rereading—something that speed-reading training courses discourage and that devices using RSVP may make impossible. In fact, recent research demonstrates this point quite clearly. Schotter, Tran, and Rayner (2014) had people read garden-path sentences (such as the one in Fig. 13) while their eye movements were monitored. The sentences were presented either normally or with a trailing-mask manipulation, in which each letter in a word was replaced with an x after the reader’s eyes moved past it. This manipulation ensured that readers had only one encounter with the word—if they returned to reread it, they would be looking at a string of x’s. Schotter and colleagues found that readers could accurately respond to a two-alternative comprehension question about the sentence much better when they were able to reread words (i.e., when they made a regression in the normal reading condition: 75% accuracy) than when they could not (i.e., when they made a regression in the trailing-mask condition: around 50% accuracy—chance performance). These findings suggest that having only one encounter with the words in the sentence might not be sufficient for successful understanding of the text.","completion":"شکل 12. نمونه محرک‌ها در پارادایم استروپ. کار این است که رنگ جوهری که کلمه با آن چاپ شده است را تا حد امکان سریع و دقیق نام ببرید. ستون 1 شرایط هماهنگ را نشان می‌دهد (هر کلمه رنگی که با آن چاپ شده است را نام می‌برد)، ستون 2 شرایط خنثی را نشان می‌دهد (هر محرک یک رشته x رنگی است)، و ستون 3 شرایط ناهماهنگ را نشان می‌دهد (کلمات رنگ‌های مختلفی از رنگ‌هایی که با آن چاپ شده‌اند را نام می‌برند). آنچه در مورد این اثر شگفت‌انگیز است، علاوه بر اینکه چقدر قوی و به راحتی قابل اثبات است، این است که ما به طور کلی فکر می‌کنیم که نامیدن رنگ باید به اندازه‌ای آسان باشد که کلمات بی‌اهمیت باشند - به یاد داشته باشید که مخروط‌ها (گیرنده‌های نوری در چشم شما) به طور خاص برای تشخیص رنگ تنظیم شده‌اند. در واقع، برخی از اپلیکیشن‌های خواندن سریع که از رنگ استفاده می‌کنند ادعا می‌کنند که \\"تا به حال تعجب کردید که چرا چراغ‌های راهنمایی از رنگ استفاده می‌کنند و نه از کلمات؟ این به این دلیل است که مغز انسان رنگ را بسیار سریع پردازش می‌کند - بسیار بیشتر از اینکه بتواند کلمات را پردازش کند\\" (http://www.beelinereader.com/). اثر استروپ نشان می‌دهد که ممکن است به سادگی اینطور نباشد؛ هنگامی که خواننده در یک زبان ماهر است (این اثر زمانی که کلمات به زبانی که فرد نمی‌داند چاپ شده‌اند ظاهر نمی‌شود)، شناسایی کلمه به قدری سریع و قوی است که می‌تواند با بازیابی یک کلمه رقابتی - نام رنگ - تداخل کند. اثر موقعیت بهینه دید مهم است که توجه کنیم با اثر استروپ، تداخل ایجاد شده توسط عدم تطابق بین نام کلمه و رنگ جوهر در هنگامی که افراد به مرکز کلمه نگاه می‌کنند، قوی‌تر است تا زمانی که به حروف محیطی‌تر تثبیت می‌کنند (پرت و دوکروت، 2010). این موضوع به این دلیل مهم است که اثر موقعیت بهینه دید (OVP)، که در آن کلماتی که به صورت منفرد ارائه می‌شوند، زمانی که افراد به مرکز کلمه نگاه می‌کنند نسبت به زمانی که به حروف خارجی‌تر نگاه می‌کنند، با کارایی بیشتری شناسایی می‌شوند، قویاً نشان داده شده است (اورگان، لوی-شوئن، پینته، و بروگیلره، 1984). اگرچه این اثر به طور مداوم برای ارائه‌های تک کلمه‌ای به دست می‌آید، در حدود چند میلی‌ثانیه کم است. این حتی کوچک‌تر حین خواندن طبیعی متن است (ویتو، اورگان، و میتاو، 1990)، احتمالاً به دلیل توانایی به دست آوردن پیش‌نمایش پارافوویال که قبلاً بحث کردیم. این نکته بعداً زمانی که در مورد برخی از فناوری‌های خواندن سریع که کلمات را نزدیک به موقعیت OVP متمرکز می‌کنند، مهم خواهد شد. ادعا این است که این کار به این دلیل انجام می‌شود که مردم نمی‌توانند کلمه‌ای را شناسایی کنند مگر اینکه به OVP تثبیت کنند. با این حال، تحقیقات نشان می‌دهد که مردم در صورتی که به OVP تثبیت نکنند، قادر به شناسایی کلمات نخواهند بود؛ در عوض، فرایند شناسایی فقط کمی کند خواهد شد. نقش فونولوژی در خواندن بی‌صدا با توجه به اینکه تمام سیستم‌های نوشتاری کلمات را نشان می‌دهند و با توجه به اینکه شکل اولیه زبان صوتی و شنیداری است، نه بصری، جای تعجب نیست که پردازش فونولوژیک نقش مهمی در خواندن دارد - حتی در خواندن بی‌صدا (لیننجر، 2014 را ببینید). این صادق است نه تنها برای سیستم‌های نوشتاری الفبایی، که در آن حروف نویسه‌های فردی در کلمات را نمایندگی می‌کنند، بلکه همچنین برای سیستم‌های نوشتاری غیرالفبایی مانند چینی. حال ما به توصیف تعدادی از مطالعات می‌پردازیم که نشان می‌دهند خوانندگان به طور طبیعی به صدای کلمات دسترسی دارند در حالی که به طور بی‌صدا می‌خوانند و تلاش‌هایی برای مهار این فرایند به طور کلی تأثیرات منفی بر خواندن دارد. این مطالعات مهم است که در نور ادعای خواندن سریع که استفاده از گفتار درونی برای خوانندگان مشکلات ایجاد می‌کند، بررسی شوند. ابتدا، یک مطالعه را در نظر بگیرید که در آن از خوانندگان ماهر خواسته شده است که نشان دهند (با فشار دادن دکمه) آیا کلمات کوتاه معرفی شده عضو دسته‌بندی خاصی (مثلاً غذاها؛ ون اوردن، 1987) هستند یا خیر. افراد در این مطالعه به اشتباه \\"بله\\" به کلمه‌ای که عضو دسته‌بندی نبود (مثلاً \\"meet\\" برای دسته‌ی غذا) حدود 19٪ از زمان پاسخ دادند اگر آن کلمه یک هم‌آوایی از عضو واقعی دسته‌بندی بود: در این مثال، \\"meet\\" همانند \\"meat\\"، که غذا است، تلفظ می‌شود. پاسخ‌های \\"بله\\" به اشتباه به کلمات غیر هم‌آوایی - به عنوان مثال \\"melt\\" - تنها 3٪ از زمان رخ داد. این به این دلیل است که در حالی که \\"melt\\" همان تعداد حروف را با \\"meat\\" به اشتراک‌گذاری می‌کند که \\"meet\\" انجام می‌دهد، اما تلفظ را به اشتراک‌گذاری نمی‌کند. زمانی که افراد به درستی پاسخ دادند که به عنوان مثال \\"meet\\" غذا نیست، زمان بیشتری برای انجام این کار نسبت به \\"melt\\" طول کشید. این نتایج نشان می‌دهد که افراد به صداهای کلمه دسترسی داشتند و تحت تأثیر قوی این واقعیت بودند که کد فونولوژیکی آن همانند یک عضو واقعی دسته‌بندی بود. خوانندگان چینی نیز وقتی می‌خوانند صدای کلمات را فعال می‌کنند (شو، پولاتسک، و پاتر، 1999)، هرچند چینی یک سیستم نوشتاری الفبایی نیست. مطالعات استفاده از هم‌آوایی‌ها نیز شواهدی برای گفتار درونی در طی خواندن بی‌صدا متن پیدا کرده‌اند. به عنوان مثال، وقتی از افراد خواسته شد به طور بی‌صدا بخوانند و قضاوت‌های بسیار سریعی درباره‌ی اینکه آیا جملات منطقی بودند انجام دهند، آن‌ها به اشتباه یک جمله مانند \\"She has blonde hare\\" را حدود 12٪ از زمان پذیرفتند، بیشتر از اینکه به اشتباه یک جمله مانند \\"She has blonde harm\\" را (حدود 5٪ از زمان؛ تریمن، فرید، و بارون، 1983) پذیرفتند. اگر استفاده از فونولوژی فرآیندی نامهم بود که خوانندگان می‌توانستند به راحتی خاموش کنند، ما انتظار داشتیم که آن‌ها این کار را انجام دهند. اینکه آن‌ها نتوانستند نشان می‌دهد که فونولوژی به فرآیند خواندن بنیادین است. چه اتفاقی می‌افتاد اگر ما در حین خواندن گفتار درونی را حذف می‌کردیم؟ طراحی یک روش که جلوی افراد را از انجام یک فعالیت ذهنی بگیرد مشکل است، اما محققان دو رویکرد را امتحان کرده‌اند. یک رویکرد استفاده از تکنیک‌های بیوفیدبک برای وادار کردن افراد به کاهش فعالیتی است که گاهی اوقات در عضلات گفتاری‌شان در حین خواندن بی‌صدا رخ می‌دهد. در یک مطالعه، یک زنگ پخش می‌شد وقتی یک نظاره‌گر چنین فعالیتی را تشخیص می‌داد و از خوانندگان خواسته می‌شد که زنگ را خاموش نگه دارند (هاردیک و پترینوویچ، 1970). خوانندگان تا حدودی توانستند زنگ را خاموش نگه دارند و عملکردشان در یک آزمون فهمیدن بعدی تحت تأثیر قرار نگرفت اگر متن آسان‌تر بود، اما اگر متن دشوارتر بود آسیب دید. این اثر به نظر نمی‌رسید که فقط بازتابی از پیچیدگی اضافه خواندن در حین گوش فرا دادن برای یک زنگ باشد، زیرا فهمیدن در گروهی از شرکت کنندگان که فعالیت عضلات بازویشان به شیوه مشابه رصد می‌شد، آسیب ندید. روش دی"},{"prompt":"and this please: Another way to try to decrease the use of inner speech during silent reading is to have people count aloud or repeat an irrelevant word or phrase while they are reading (Daneman & Newson, 1992).

However, the comma is indeed optional in English grammar and writers (and speakers) are not very good at anticipating whether readers (or listeners) are likely to misinterpret what they write (or say; Ferreira & Schotter, 2013). Therefore, garden-path sentences like this occur much more often than one might imagine (they are quite notorious for occurring in newspaper headlines; e.g., “McDonald’s fries the holy grail for potato farmers”: Crash Blossoms Up the Garden Path, 2009). Further complicating the process of understanding sentences is that words can be ambiguous with respect to their grammatical role—that is, their part of speech. In the garden-path example we have been discussing, the problem in interpreting the sentence is not due to difficulty discerning the meaning of the individual words but rather to difficulty deciding whether Mary was mending the sock or whether the sock fell. Add to that ambiguity the difficulty of deciding whether a word itself means one idea or another and you find yourself in a very difficult situation. For example, consider a sentence that begins, “The desert trains . . .” With only these words, you will not be able to figure out how this phrase should be interpreted until you get more information from the rest of the sentence. Context would help you determine whether those words should be interpreted as a noun and verb (i.e., “The desert trains boys to be men”) or an adjective and a noun (i.e., “The desert trains are hot and dusty”). The information that would help you understand the roles and meanings of “desert trains” occurs after the ambiguous phrase. When you first encounter the words “desert trains,” you must make a best guess as to how to understand them. When your first guess at an interpretation is wrong, then you run into problems. In these situations, readers fix the problem by making regressions and rereading the sentence (or parts thereof) in order to find the correct interpretation (Frazier & Rayner, 1987). Fixing comprehension failure The examples we have been discussing show that discourse can sometimes contain syntactic ambiguities and it is only via careful reading that the reader will be able to appreciate the appropriate meaning. Readers are often able to fix comprehension problems by rereading—something that speed-reading training courses discourage and that devices using RSVP may make impossible. In fact, recent research demonstrates this point quite clearly. Schotter, Tran, and Rayner (2014) had people read garden-path sentences (such as the one in Fig. 13) while their eye movements were monitored. The sentences were presented either normally or with a trailing-mask manipulation, in which each letter in a word was replaced with an x after the reader’s eyes moved past it. This manipulation ensured that readers had only one encounter with the word—if they returned to reread it, they would be looking at a string of x’s. Schotter and colleagues found that readers could accurately respond to a two-alternative comprehension question about the sentence much better when they were able to reread words (i.e., when they made a regression in the normal reading condition: 75% accuracy) than when they could not (i.e., when they made a regression in the trailing-mask condition: around 50% accuracy—chance performance). These findings suggest that having only one encounter with the words in the sentence might not be sufficient for successful understanding of the text.","completion":"یکی دیگر از روش‌های کاهش استفاده از گفتار درونی در خواندن بی‌صدا، داشتن افرادی است که در حین خواندن، بلند شمردن یا تکرار کلمه یا عبارتی بی‌ربط را انجام دهند (دانمن و نیوسن، 1992). در چنین مطالعاتی، خوانندگان درک ضعیف‌تری از متن داشتند وقتی که آن‌ها کلمات بی‌ربط را تکرار می‌کردند، اما نه زمانی که دنباله‌ای بی‌ربط از ضربه‌ها با انگشتان‌شان را تکرار می‌کردند. این نتیجه آخر نشان می‌دهد که گفتار بود، نه نیاز به انجام دو کار، که درک خواندن را مختل کرد. در مطالعه دیگری که در آن افراد گفتار بی‌ربط را در حین خواندن بی‌صدا تکرار می‌کردند، خوانندگان بسیار خوب در پاسخ دادن به سوالات فهمیدنی در مورد مفاهیم فردی بودند اما بدتر بودند در پاسخ دادن به سوالاتی که از آن‌ها می‌خواست ترکیب کنند مفاهیم و استنباط کنند (اسلویاچک و کلیفتون، 1980). این یافته‌ها ایده را پشتیبانی می‌کنند که در مورد درک مواد پیچیده، گفتار درونی فعالیتی مزاحم نیست که باید حذف شود، همانطور که بسیاری از طرفداران خواندن سریع پیشنهاد می‌کنند. بلکه ترجمه اطلاعات بصری به شکل فونولوژیک، شکل اساسی زبان، به خوانندگان کمک می‌کند تا آن را درک کنند. مدل‌های شناسایی کلمات پیش‌تر، ما بحث کردیم که چگونه محققان مدل‌های دقیقی از کنترل حرکت چشم توسعه داده‌اند. همچنین مدل‌های دقیقی از فرایند شناسایی کلمات نیز وجود دارد. مدل‌هایی که بیشترین توجه را به خود جلب کرده‌اند و بیشترین تحقیقات را برانگیخته‌اند مدل‌های دو مسیره تسریع شده (DRC) (مانند کولهارت، راستل، پری، لانگدون، و زیگلر، 2001) و مدل‌های پردازش موازی توزیع شده (PDP)، که همچنین به مدل‌های اتصال‌گرا یا مثلثی شناخته می‌شوند (مانند سایدنبرگ و مک‌کللند، 1989). مدل‌ها در برخی نکات اختلاف نظر دارند، نشان‌دهنده اینکه دانشمندان هنوز چیزهایی برای یادگیری درباره فرایند شناسایی کلمات دارند. با این حال، برخی از زمینه‌های مهم توافق وجود دارد. برای یکی، مدل‌ها فرض اولیه مشترکی دارند که ورودی‌های ارتوگرافیک پایین به بالا با آنچه افراد درباره کلمات می‌دانند تعامل می‌کنند تا تلفظ‌ها و معانی را تولید کنند. یعنی، هم اطلاعات بصری دقیق از متن و هم تجربه قبلی با زبان لازم هستند. یک دیگر از زمینه‌های توافق بین مدل‌های شناسایی کلمات این است که نمایش‌های داخلی فونولوژی نقشی در شناسایی کلماتی دارند که به صورت بصری ارائه می‌شوند و توسط خواننده بلند تلفظ نمی‌شوند. نقش زمینه در انتخاب معنای صحیح کلمه در بعضی موارد، یک کلمه دو معنای جداگانه دارد اما همان املایی و تلفظی را دارد. نمونه‌ای از چنین هموگرافی کلمه \\"bank\\" است، که می‌تواند به یک موسسه مالی یا کنار یک رودخانه اشاره کند. ابهام لغوی از این نوع پیچیده‌گی‌های شناسایی کلمه را پیچیده می‌کند. ابهام لغوی نادر نیست - زبان انگلیسی بیش از 1500 هموگراف می‌شود (لایننجر و راینر، 2013) - و ممکن است حتی ویژگی دلخواه زبان باشد، زیرا به ما اجازه می‌دهد تا اشکالات کلمه را برای اهداف چندگانه به‌جای ایجاد کلمات جدید، که افزایش‌یافته و پیچیده‌تر می‌شوند، استفاده مجدد کنیم (پیانتادوسی، تیلی، و گیبسون، 2012). با این حال، دشواری به وجود می‌آید، زیرا صرف دانستن شکل بصری و تلفظ کلمه نمی‌تواند نشان دهد که خواننده باید کدام یک از دو معنی را تفسیر کند. هنگامی که یک هموگراف به صورت انفرادی رخ می‌دهد، غیرممکن است که معنی مورد نظر آن را تشخیص داد. خوشبختانه، خوانندگان معمولاً از مزایای زمینه جمله‌ای برخوردار هستند که می‌توانند به آن‌ها سرنخ‌هایی در مورد اینکه کدام معنی را باید تفسیر کنند، بدهد. به عنوان مثال، خواندن کلمه \\"bank\\" به عنوان \\"موسسه مالی\\" وقتی که پیش از \\"جان برای سپرده‌گذاری برخی پول در ...\\" باشد، آسان خواهد بود. در مقابل، احتمالاً بیشتر خواهید فهمید که به \\"کنار رودخانه\\" اشاره دارد اگر پیش از \\"جان برای قایق‌رانی در رودخانه ...\\" باشد. در این نمونه، اطلاعاتی که به تمایز معنی کلمه \\"bank\\" کمک می‌کنند پیش از خود کلمه وجود دارند. اما گاهی اطلاعات رفع ابهام پس از کلمه ظاهر می‌شوند. در این شرایط، خوانندگان کمتر احتمال دارد که تفسیر صحیح اولیه را انجام دهند. درعوض، خوانندگان معمولاً رگرسیون‌هایی به عقب به کلمه انجام می‌دهند اگر در ابتدا آن را اشتباه تفسیر کرده‌باشند (برای مثال، دافی، موریس، و راینر، 1988؛ راینر و دافی، 1986). تأمین یا عدم اطمینان در تشخیص معنی دقیق کلمه نیز می‌تواند زمانی که شکل‌های کلمه از لحاظ بصری بسیار مشابه باشند، به وجود آید، همان‌طور که با همسایه‌های جایگزینی ارتوگرافیک (برای مثال، birch و birth) و همسایه‌های تبدیل حرف (برای مثال، calm و clam) است. احتمال اینکه کلمه اشتباه تفسیر شود بالاتر است اگر کلمه صحیح نادر و کلمه بسیار مشابه رایج‌تر باشد. زمینه می‌تواند به خوانندگان در چنین مواردی کمک کند؛ خوانندگان زمان آسان‌تری برای شناسایی کلمه صحیح دارند (در مقابل کلمه بصری مشابه) وقتی زمینه جمله پیشین معنی صحیح را نشان می‌دهد (جانسون، 2009؛ اسلتری، 2009). زمینه جمله همچنین به خوانندگان کمک می‌کند با کلماتی که نه هموگراف‌اند و نه همسایه سایر کلمات، نشان دهنده اینکه اثر به طور کلی عمومی است. به عنوان مثال، یک زمینه محدّد، که یک کلمه خاص را قابل پیش‌بینی می‌کند، به این کلمه کمتر توجه شده (یعنی بیشتر حذف می‌شود) و برای زمان کمتری نسبت به اینکه اگر با یک زمینه خنثی که می‌توانست توسط طیف گسترده‌ای از کلمات تکمیل شود، پیش آمده بود (اهرلیچ و راینر، 1981؛ زولا، 1984؛ ببینید راینر، 1998، 2009، برای مرور‌ها). یک زمینه محدّد همچنین زمان پاسخ در وظایف نام‌گذاری (استانوویچ و وست، 1979، 1981؛ وست و استانوویچ، 1982) و تصمیم لغوی (شوبرت و ایماس، 1977) را سرعت بخشیده و بر پاسخ مغز به کلمات تأثیر می‌گذارد، همانطور که با ERP اندازه‌گیری شده (کوتاس و هیلیارد، 1984؛ ببینید کوتاس و فدرمایر، 2011). یافته‌ها درباره اهمیت زمینه‌ در شناسایی کلمه‌های بصری نشان می‌دهند که دوره‌های آموزشی‌ که به دانش‌آموزان یاد می‌دهند دوباره نخوانند و وسایل خواندن سریع که اجازه بازگرداندن نمی‌دهند، خواهند کرد خوانندگان بیشتر احتمال داشته باشند که کلمات را وقتی در زمینه‌های کمتر محدّد قرار می‌گیرند، اشتباه تفسیر کنند. درک مطلب با توجه به اینکه خواندن معمولاً به طور هموار پیش می‌رود، ما ممکن است پیچیدگی‌های ظریفی که با درک معنی یک متن همراه هستند را متوجه نشویم. ما قبلاً ذکر کردیم که برخی از کلمات به دلیل داشتن چندین معنی، ابهام‌آمیز هستند. جملات نیز می‌توانند ابهام‌آمیز باشند که چگونه هر کلمه فردی در یک جمله داده شده عمل می‌کند و به سایر کلمات مربوط است (یعنی نحو جمله). به جمله \\"While Mary was mending the sock fell off her lap.\\" نگاه کنید. وقتی یک جمله مانند این"},{"prompt":"Adaçayının yararları","completion":"Adaçayı (Salvia officinalis), özellikle Akdeniz bölgesine özgü bir bitki türüdür ve uzun bir süre boyunca hem yiyecek katkısı hem de tıbbi amaçlarla kullanılmıştır.

Bunların bazı olası nedenleri şunlardır: 1. Postprandial hipoglisemi (yemek sonrası hipoglisemi): Bazı insanlar yemekten sonra kan şekeri seviyelerinde hızlı bir düşüş yaşayabilirler. Bu, genellikle yüksek karbonhidratlı bir öğünden sonra olur ve çarpıntı, halsizlik, terleme, titreme ve hatta konfüzyona neden olabilir. 2. Reaktif hipoglisemi: Bu durum yemekten sonra kan şekeri seviyelerinin anormal şekilde düşmesidir ve genellikle ağır karbonhidrat içeren yemeklerden 2-4 saat sonra görülür. Semptomlara yorgunluk, çarpıntı, terleme ve halsizlik dahildir. 3. Gastroparezi: Mide kaslarının bozukluğuna bağlı olarak mideden yavaş bir boşalma sürecidir. Bu durum aşırı tamlik hissi, bulantı, halsizlik, terleme ve karın ağrısına yol açabilir. 4. Dumping sendromu: Genellikle mide ameliyatı geçirmiş hastalarda görülür. Yemek yedikten hemen sonra veya birkaç saat sonra ortaya çıkan semptomlar, hızlı mide boşalması nedeniyle oluşur ve çarpıntı, halsizlik, terleme, baş dönmesi ve bazen ishal içerebilir. 5. Gıda alerjileri veya intoleransları: Belirli gıdalara karşı alerjiler veya intoleranslar da yemekten sonra benzer semptomlara neden olabilir. 6. Kalp hastalıkları: Kalp yetmezliği veya koroner arter hastalığı gibi kalp sorunları da yemekten sonra semptomları tetikleyebilir, çünkü yemek yemek kalbe olan kan akışının artmasına ve buna bağlı olarak kardiyovasküler sistemi yormasına neden olabilir. 7. Aşırı yeme: Bazı durumlarda, fazla miktarda yemek yemek, sindirim sistemine aşırı yük bindirebilir ve bu da çarpıntıya, terlemeye ve halsizliğe yol açabilir. 8. Hormonal durumlar: Tiroid fonksiyon bozukluğu gibi bazı hormonal dengesizlikler yemekten sonra benzer semptomlar üretebilir.

Taşikardinin olası nedenlerini aşağıda sıralıyorum: 1. **Reaktif Hipoglisemi**: Yüksek karbonhidrat içeren öğünlerden sonra kan şekeri hızla yükselir ve ardından da hızla düşer. Bu düşüş, bazen vücudun kompansasyon mekanizması olarak adrenalin salgılamasına neden olur ve bu da kalp atış hızını artırabilir. 2. **Vagus Siniri Stimülasyonu**: Yemek yemek, özellikle de büyük ve ağır yemekler, vagus sinirini stimüle edebilir. Vagus siniri bedenin birçok fonksiyonunu düzenler ve bazı durumlarda bu sinirin stimülasyonu taşikardiye neden olabilir. 3. **Kardiyak Sfinkterin Gevşemesi**: Bazı insanlarda yemeklerden sonra alt özofageal sfinkter gevşer ve bu da mide asidinin yemek borusuna geri kaçmasına (reflü) ve sonuç olarak da taşikardiye yol açabilir. 4. **Dumping Sendromu**: Mide ameliyatı geçirmiş insanlarda mide boşalmasının çok hızlı olmasından kaynaklanabilir. Bu, yemek yedikten sonra hızlı bir şekilde taşikardiye yol açabilir. 5. **Alkol ve Kafein**: Alkol ve kafein gibi uyarıcı maddeler içeren gıdalar veya içecekler yemekten sonra taşikardiye neden olabilir. 6. **Gıda İntoleransları ve Alerjiler**: Bazı gıda intoleransları veya alerjiler, özellikle yemekten sonra, vücudun histamin gibi kimyasal maddeler salgılamasına neden olabilir ve bu da kalp atış hızını artırabilir. 7. **Kalp ve Damar Hastalıkları**: Kalp yetmezliği, koroner arter hastalığı veya aritmi gibi kalp ve damar sistemiyle ilgili durumlar da taşikardinin altında yatan sebepler arasında olabilir. 8. **Özerk Sinir Sistemi Düzensizlikleri**: Vücut yemek yedikten sonra kan akışını sindirim sistemi organlarına yönlendirir ve bu sırada özerk sinir sisteminde düzensizlikler taşikardiye yol açabilir. 9. **Psikolojik Durumlar**: Stres ve anksiyete gibi psikolojik durumlar da taşikardiye sebebiyet verebilir.

Yaşamın sürükleyici ritmi içinde, her birimiz zaman zaman geçmişin ya da ulaşamadığımız geleceğin dalgalarına kapılırız. Özlem, zamanın ve mekânın ötesine geçen bir duygudur; hem içimizde saklı bir umudu temsil eder hem de süregiden bir yokluğun hüznünü barındırır. Kimi zaman bir insan özlemi, kimi zaman bir anı, bir mekân, belki de bir hissiyat olarak karşımıza çıkar özlem. Çocukluğun masumiyetini özleriz belki de; o çıplak ayakların toprakla buluştuğu, gökyüzüne sımsıkı sarılı rüyaların peşinde koştuğumuz günleri. Ya da ilk gençlik sevgimizi, kalbimizin titrek ama umut dolu attığı o ilk bakışı, el ele tutuşmanın verdiği sıcaklığı. Özlemin rengi gri, sesi ise maziden gelen bir hüzün nağmesidir. Yüreğin köşelerinde, unutulmuş bir melodinin son notası gibi yankılanır. Gelir, sessizce yanı başımıza oturur; bazen hafif bir tebessüm, bazen buruk bir gözyaşı olarak kıyısında durduğumuz o derin ve uçsuz bucaksız iç denizin durgun sularında hafif çırpıntılara neden olur. Gurbetin sert soğuğunda en yakıcı hale bürünür özlem. Annenin sıcak yemeğinin, babanın güvence dolu kollarının, dostların kahkahalarıyla yankılanan sokakların yerini alır. Mevsimler gelip geçerken, hasretin soğuk rüzgarları içimizi ürpertir ve özlem, içimizde bir meşale olur, bazen yolumuzu aydınlatan ve bazen bizi ısıtan. Özlem, aynı zamanda bir bekleyiştir; umudun ve sabrın iç içe geçtiği, zamanın adeta durduğu, bir geleceğin özgürlüğüne kanat çırptığı bir bekleyiş. Uzak diyarlarda ya da yakın bir geçmişte bir yerlerde, kalbimizin derinliklerine nakşettiğimiz o özel anların ve insanların, hayat akıp giderken bir gün bize geri dönmesini beklemek. Ve kimi zaman anlarız ki özlem, yalnızca yok olan ya da uzakta olan için değildir. Yanı başımızda, her gün gördüğümüz ama bir türlü kavuşamadığımız, dokunamadığımız için de varolan bir duygudur. Kalabalıklar içinde yalnızlığı özlemek, huzur dolu bir sabahın sessizliğini özlemek gibi. Edebiyat, özlemi satırlara döken bir sanattır. Yazarın kaleminden dökülen her kelime, bir özlemin ifadesi, her cümle bir özlemin hikayesidir.

Söz konusu zamansal mesafeler olduğunda, özlem, geçmiş günlerin ışıltısını ararken hissettiğimiz, bazen tatlı bir melankoliye dönüşebilir. Geçmişten koparılan anlar, hasretle yad edilen hatıralar ve unutulmaya yüz tutmuş gülücükler özlemin en vurucu şekilde ortaya çıktığı anlardır. Özlemin derinliği sadece geçmişin koridorlarına sığışmakla kalmaz; zaman zaman geleceğe duyulan bir özlem olarak da kendini gösterir. Gelecekteki belirsiz buluşmalar, hayaller, hedefler ve arzular için hissedilen özlem, belki de en kavrayış güçlü olanıdır. Geleceğe yönelik özlem, umut ve hayal kırıklığı arasında gidip gelen karmaşık duyguların bir tezahürüdür.

Nesneler, bize sevdiklerimizle geçirdiğimiz özel anları hatırlattıklarında, onlara olan özlemimizi tetikler. Bir melodi, bizi geçmişin bir dönemine götürdüğünde orada yaşadıklarımıza dair özlemimizi canlandırır. Ve kitaplar, içlerinde yaşattıkları dünyalara olan özlemimizi körüklediklerinde, bizi bilinmez bir maceraya, belki de yaşamın ta kendisine karşı bir özlem hissine sürükler. Sanatta özlem, bir ressamın tuvaline yansıyan nostaljik bir renk cümbüşü olarak karşımıza çıktığı gibi, bir bestecinin birkaç notaya sıkıştırdığı hüzünlü bir melodi olarak kulaklarımıza ulaşır. Bir heykeltıraşın elleriyle şekillendirdiği formda yitik bir sevgiliye olan özlemi görebiliriz, bir dansçının her adımında geçmişe duyduğu özlemi hissedebiliriz. Özlem, edebi bir eserde, satır aralarında kendini saklayarak; her metinde, her hikayede, her şiirde yaşar.

Köyün adı \\"Yeşeren Ufuklar\\" idi, ancak yıllar boyu süren kuraklık ve kötü hasatlar, adını anlamsız kılacak kadar umutsuz bir yere dönüştürmüştü. Köylülerin çoğu zor günler geçiriyor, bazıları ise yıllar önce verimli topraklara sahip olan köylerini terk etmişti. Köyün en yaşlı adamı Eren Dede, bir zamanlar bu toprakların en verimli olduğu günleri, akşamları genç çocuklara anlatırdı. Onun en büyük arzusu, köyün eski günlerine geri dönmesiydi, ama artık bunun için fazla bir şey yapamayacağına inanıyordu; yaşlılığın getirdiği yorgunluk ve hayal kırıklığı onu yıldırmıştı. Bir gün, köye genç ve enerjik bir adam geldi. Adı Umut'tu ve kaybettiği ailesinin ardından yeni bir başlangıç yapmak istemişti. Umut, boş tarlalara baktığında çorak toprağın altında saklı bir bereket olduğunu hissedebiliyordu. Köylüler onun bu iyimserliğine şüpheyle yaklaşsalar da, Umut, herkesin hikayesini dinlemek ve herkese yardım etmek için zaman ayırdı. Onun bu kararlı ve pozitif tutumu zamanla köylülerin ilgisini çekmeye başladı. Umut, tarım hakkında bildiği modern yöntemleri köylülerle paylaştı. Bir tohum bankası kurdu ve herkese, yetiştirebilecekleri bitkiler hakkında bilgi verdi. Yağmur toplama sistemleri, toprağı koruyacak dönüşümlü ekim yöntemleri ve sürdürülebilir tarım teknikleri hakkında köylüleri eğitti. İlk başlarda her şey sıkıntılı görünse de, Eren Dede'nin tecrübesi ve Umut'un modern bilgisi birleşince, köylüler yavaş yavaş umutlarını geri kazandılar. İlk yağmurlarla birlikte, kurumuş toprak yeniden canlanmaya başladı ve uzun süredir görülmemiş filizler yeşermeye başladı. Umut, köylülere tek başlarına başaramayacakları hiçbir şey olmadığını öğretti. Sabırla, her mevsim bir öncekinden daha cömert hasatlar vermeye başladı. Yeşeren Ufuklar köyü yavaş yavaş adına yeniden kavuştu ve topraklarına dönen verimlilik, göç etmiş olanların da geri dönmesine vesile oldu. Eren Dede, Umut sayesinde köydeki herkesin ruhunda yeşeren umudu ve azmi gördü ve sonunda bir daha \\"Eski günler devrilmiş bir ağaçtır, geri dikilemez\\" demekten vazgeçti. Hikayelerini anlatmaya devam etti, ancak artık geçmişin hikayeleri yerine geleceğin hikayeleriyle örülüydü. Köyün hikayesi, bazen hayatın en beklenmedik zamanlarında bile umudun güçlü bir kaynak olduğunu öğretir. Bir kişinin inancı, aksiyona dönüştüğünde bir topluluğu değiştirebilir ve yeniden yeşertecek bir umut tohumu ekilebilir. Umut, köyde yalnızca filizlenen bir bitki değil, aynı zamanda insanların yüreğinde yeşertilmiş bir inançtı. Umut, her zaman, ısrarla ve kararlılıkla hayat bulacak bir tohumdur."},{"prompt":"Bu hikayeyi betimlemelerle, örneklerle geliştirebilir misin. Daha fazla edebi metafor kullanarak","completion":"Bir zamanlar, gökyüzünün sonsuz maviliği altında, zamanın unutulmuşçasına terk ettiği topraklarda, Yeşeren Ufuklar adıyla bilinen bir köy yatıyordu. Gündüzleri altın sarısı güneşin ışıklarıyla parıl parıl parlayan, geceleri ise yıldızların sadık ışıkları altında hülyalı bir huzura gömülen bu topraklar, adeta bir zamanlar masallarda var olmuş bereketli diyarların siluetlerini taşıyordu. Ne var ki, son yıllarda üzerine çöken kuraklık peçesi, köyün altın sayfalarını karaltmış, yeşil düşler yılgınlığın tozlu rafına kaldırılmıştı. Eren Dede'nin gözleri, yitik bir deniz feneri gibi anıları aydınlatan; geçmiş günlerin rengarenk hikâyelerini, derin çizgileriyle bölük pörçük haritalara dönen yüzünde saklardı. Her yorgun nefesi, bir zamanlar bu toprakların nasıl şen şakrak çocuk sesleri, hasat neşesi ve ortak umutlarla dolup taştığını fısıldardı. Ancak nefesinin bu fısıltıları, köyün genç ruhlarını sarıp sarmalamak yerine, rüzgârla birlikte uzaklara savrulup gidiyordu. Ve böyle bir zamanda, köye, günde bin kez yeniden doğan şafak kadar parlak bir isimle anılan Umut adında bir adam geldi. Onun varlığı, tıpkı uykusundan yeni uyanan bahar sabahının ilk ışıkları gibi, köyün pas tutmuş kapılarına vurmuştu. Yılların yorgunluğu altında ezilmiş olan toprak, Umut’un titiz ve sevgi dolu dokunuşlarıyla, yürek atışlarını tekrar duyurmaya başlamıştı. Umut, toprağın kokusunu içine çektiğinde, köylülerin umutlarını da yeniden canlandırabileceğine inanıyordu. Umut ve Eren Dede'nin eşgüdümü, köy meydanında bir zamanlar unutulmuş olan yaşam ateşinin alevlenmesine sebep oldu. İkisinin ortak azmi, köylülerin yavaş yavaş solan cesaretlerine, tıpkı bozkırın ortasında bir vaha yaratır gibi hayat verdi. Bir zamanlar çorak ve sessiz olan tarlalar, şimdi umudun toprağa düşmüş tohumlarından beslenen yeni bir yaşam umuduyla dolup taşıyordu. Yağmur damlaları, adeta gökten düşen nimetler olarak toprakla buluştuğunda, kökler derinlere inatla nüfuz ederek kuraklığın izlerini sildi. Bu bereketli dönüşümün ilk filizleri, Eren Dede'nin neredeyse unutulmuş olan türkülerini yeniden köy meydanında yankılatmaya başladı. Anneler, çocuklarına yatmadan önce artık sadece geçmişin masallarını değil, geleceğin öykülerini de anlatır oldular. Yeni gelen sabahların her biri, üzerine serpiştirilmiş umut zerrecikleriyle parlıyordu. Her bir tohum, köylülerin dayanışmasının ve kardeşliğinin, bir nehir gibi etrafa yayılan bereketinin sembolü haline gelmişti. Umut'un köye gelişi, bir zamanlar bölük pörçük olan topluluğu, tekrar bir araya getiren güçlü bir rüzgar gibiydi. Şimdi köy, Yeşeren Ufuklar'ın adının hakkını veren, tekrar yeşilin ve toprağın şarkısını söyleyen bir cennet bahçesiydi. Umut ve sabrın ektiği tohumlar, yarının daha aydınlık olacağına dair umutlarla sulanmış, ve nihayetinde, bir toplumu tekrar canlandırabilecek bir döngüye sebep olmuştu. Umut, köyde sadece bir isim değil, aynı zamanda köylülerin yüreklerinde yeşeren bir inanç ve yeniden doğan bir hayat biçimiydi."},{"prompt":"Bu metni aynı şekilde olaylar ekleyerek geliştirebilir misin","completion":"Bir zamanlar, Yeşeren Ufuklar adını hak eden bu köy, ne yazık ki, zamansız bir kuraklığın pençesine düşmüştü. Her bir toprağın çatlağı, bir zamanlar akıp giden yaşam öykülerinin artık susmuş olduklarının hüzünlü birer izleri gibi duruyordu. Eren Dede'nin anlattığı destanlar, çocukların gözlerinde yalnızca uzak bir hayal olmaktan ileri gidemiyor, köyün sokaklarında esen umutsuzluk rüzgarları, gençleri hayatlarını başka yerlerde kurmaya itiyordu. Ancak bir gün köye adımını atan Umut'un gelişiyle köydeki bu karabasan dağılmaya başlamıştı. Umut'un ilk işi, boş ve yabani otlarla dolmuş toprakları temizlemek olmuştu. Elleri toprağa değdikçe, tıpkı bir zamanlar yaşanmış olan bereketli günler gibi, toprak da tekrardan hayat bulacakmış gibi hissediyordu. Umut'un yanı başında, köyün gençlerinden Aylin de vardı. Tarlaların yanı sıra, Umut onun da içindeki kıvılcımı güçlenmiş hissiyatla yeşertmişti. Aylin, köyünü terk etme düşüncesini bir kenara bırakmış, tarlalarda Umut'la birlikte ter döküyor, hayallerini bu topraklarda yeşerteceğine inanıyordu. Umut ve Aylin'in öncülüğünde, köyün neredeyse unutulmuş olan meyve bahçeleri, yeniden işlenmeye başlandı. Kadim elma ağaçlarının altında, küçük çocuklar kurdukları çadırlarda geceleri yıldız kaymasını izlerken, büyükler hasret ve özlemle dolu sohbetler ediyorlardı. Bir gün Aylin, küçük bir fidan dikerken etrafta dolaşan bir kelebeğin peşine takıldı ve köyün dışındaki eski bir kuyunun yanına kadar geldi. Merakla kuyunun içine baktığında içinde bir miktar su olduğunu gördü ve hemen Umut'a koşarak haber verdi. Bu keşif, köy için umutların yeşermesine vesile oldu. Kuyu, hızla köylüler için bir buluşma noktasına dönüştü, yeniden temizlendi ve etrafı köylüler tarafından onarılarak suyun korunması sağlandı. Umut ve Aylin başı çekti ve bir sulama sistemi kurmak için çalışmalara başladılar. Her hanelerde kullanılmayan tencereler, tüpler, borular derlenip toplandı ve elbirliğiyle bir toplama havuzu oluşturuldu. Bu havuz, köyün her bir tarlasına hayat veren damla damla suyun kaynağı olacaktı. Zamanla, Umut'un ısrarlı çabaları ve köylülerin azmi, çatlamış toprakların yeniden dirilişine tanıklık etti. Yeniden yeşeren tarlalar, tıpkı çayırlarda oynayan çocukların kahkahaları gibi, yaşamın habercisi oldular. Aylin'in diktikleri çiçekler ise tüm köyün sokaklarını rengârenk bir mozağe dönüştürdü. Umut, köyün her bir çocuğuna adını verdiği bir fidan hediye etti ve onları, tüm köyün katılımıyla düzenlenen bir dikim festivalinde toprağa dikmeleri için teşvik etti. Eren Dede'nin gözlerinde artık bir zamanlar anlattığı bereketli hikâyelerin hayal olmadığına dair bir parıltı vardı. Umut'un ve köylülerin ortak çabalarıyla, topraklarına dönen yeşillik ve verimlilik köyü yeniden Yeşeren Ufuklar yapmıştı. Birlik olmanın ve inanmanın gücü, gökyüzünü kaplayan kara bulutları dağıtmış, umutla dolu yeni bir yarınlara kapı aralamıştı. Umut, kelimenin tam anlamıyla köyde hayat bulmuş ve kalpleri yeniden yeşerten bir mucizeye dönüşmüştü."},{"prompt":"Timsahların ilginç ve az bilinen özellikleri hakkında bilgi verir misin","completion":"Timsahlar, sürüngenler âleminin en eski üyelerinden biri olup, milyonlarca yıl boyunca neredeyse hiç değişmeden kalmış etkileyici hayvanlardır. İşte timsahlar hakkında ilginç ve az bilinen bazı özellikler: 1. Tuzlu Su Adaptasyonu: Timsahlar türleri arasında tatlı su habitatlarında yaşayanlar olduğu gibi, tuzlu sulara uyarlanabilen timsah türleri de vardır. Örneğin, tuzlu su timsahı (Crocodylus porosus), okyanuslarda uzun mesafeler yüzebilir ve bu da onları denizlerde de yaşayabilen tek timsah türü yapar. 2. Ağız Hijyeni: Timsahlar, genellikle ağızlarını açık tutar ve bu ağız içindeki kuşların ve diğer küçük yaratıkların \\"diş temizleyici\\" olarak hizmet etmesine izin verir. Bazı kuş türleri, timsahların ağızlarındaki artıkları temizleyerek hem timsahlara hijyen sağlar hem de kendilerine bir öğün bulmuş olur. Bu, doğada \\"simbiyoz\\" olarak adlandırılan karşılıklı yarar ilişkisi örneklerinden biridir. 3. Gözyaşları: Timsahların gözyaşı döktüğüne dair bir ifade vardır, ancak bu gözyaşları aslında üzüntüden değil, fizyolojik bir süreçtendir. Timsahlar yemek yerken, göz yuvalarındaki bezler fazla tuz ve diğer atıkları atmak için gözyaşları üretir. 4. Ani Hız Patlamaları: Timsahlar genellikle yavaş ve tembel hayvanlar olarak görülse de, kısa mesafelerde ani hız patlamaları yapabilir ve avlarına hızla saldırabilirler. Aynı zamanda sudaki kuvvetli yüzücülerdir ve avlarını suda hızla takip edebilirler. 5. Nefes Kontrolü: Timsahların, nefeslerini suda 1 saate kadar tutabilme yeteneğine sahip olduğu bilinmektedir. Bu yetenek, su altında avlanırken ve tehlikeden saklanırken kullanışlıdır. 6. Sosyal İletişim: Timsahlar sessiz hayvanlar olarak düşünülse de, oldukça karışık sosyal iletişim kabiliyetlerine sahiptirler. Çiftleşme mevsiminde özellikle aktif olan timsahlar, urganmalar, homurtular ve su üzerindeki titreşimler yaratma gibi yollarla iletişim kurabilirler. 7. Yavaş Metabolizma: Timsahlar ectothermic (soğukkanlı) hayvanlar olup, metobolizmaları oldukça yavaştır. Bu özellik, onlara aylarca yemek yemeden yaşama yeteneği verir, bu da özellikle yiyecek kıtlığı durumlarında hayatta kalmalarını sağlar. 8. Derin Uykular: Araştırmalar, timsahların bir gözleri açıkken diğer gözlerini kapatarak ve bir yarımküre beyinlerini aktif tutarak uyuyabildiklerini göstermiştir. Bu, potansiyel tehlikeleri gözlemleyebilmelerini ve çevrelerini algılayabilmelerini sağlar. Timsahlar hakkında yaygın olarak bilinen birçok özellik bulunsa da, bu gibi az bilinen gerçekler bu vahşi yaratıkların ne kadar karmaşık ve ilginç hayatlar yaşadıklarını ortaya koymaktadır."},{"prompt":"Fillerin ilginç ve az bilinen özellikleri hakkında bilgi verir misin","completion":"Filler, doğanın en etkileyici ve büyüleyici yaratıkları arasında bulunurlar ve pek çok ilginç özelliğe sahiptirler. İşte filler hakkında daha az bilinen bazı ilginç bilgiler: 1. Harika Hafıza: \\"Bir fil asla unutmaz\\" ifadesi gerçek bir temele dayanır. Fillerin hafızası son derece güçlüdür ve sosyal bağları, geçmiş olayları ve mekânları uzun süre hatırlayabilirler. Bu, hayatta kalabilmek için önemli bir yetenektir, özellikle uzun göç yollarında ve su kaynaklarını hatırlamak açısından. 2. Sosyal İlişkiler: Filler çok sosyal hayvanlardır ve karmaşık aile yapılarına sahiptirler. Aile grupları çoğunlukla dişi fillerden oluşan matriarkal topluluklardır. Bu gruplar bir arada yaşar, birbirlerini korur ve genç yavruların bakımında iş birliği yapar. 3. Gömme Törenleri: Fillerin ölen bireylerine karşı gösterdiği saygı, onların etkileyici duygusal derinliklerini ortaya koyar. Bir fil öldüğünde, sürüden diğer bireyler ölümle baş etme ve yas tutma şekilleri sergileyebilir ve bazen de ölen filin üzerini dallarla ya da toprakla örterler. 4. Ses iletişimi: Filler, insan kulağının duyamayacağı düşük frekanslı sesler kullanarak, çok uzak mesafelerde bile iletişim kurabilirler. Bu infrasound dalgaları, diğer fillerle çiftleşme, tehlike ve yer konumlarını belirtmek için kullanılır. 5. Tetikteki Uykular: Filler sadece kısa periyotlar halinde uyurlar ve genellikle ayakta dinlenirler, ancak bazen yan yatıp daha derin uykuya geçebilirler. İlginç bir şekilde, filler günün sadece birkaç saati uyku ihtiyacı duyarlar, bu da onları memeliler arasında en az uyuyanlardan biri yapar. 6. Ayak Tabanlarındaki Duyarlılık: Fillerin ayak tabanları oldukça hassas yapılara sahiptir ve yerdeki titreşimleri hissedebilirler. Bu yetenek, karşılaşacakları tehlikelerden haberdar olmalarını ve sürülerinin diğer bireyleriyle iletişimde kalabilmelerini sağlar. 7. Fillerin Mezarlığı Mitosu: Efsanelerde bahsedilen \\"fillerin mezarlığı\\" aslında bir mitos olsa da, yaşlı ve hasta fillerin suya yakın alanlarda ölümü beklemek için sürüden ayrıldığı gözlemlenmiştir. Bu davranış, söz konusu mitosun nereden türediğine dair fikir verebilir. 8. Trunk Kisses: Filler birbirleriyle sosyal bağlarını güçlendirmek ve selamlaşmak için burunlarını kullanırlar - bu, insanlarda bir öpücüğe benzer şekilde \\"trunk kiss\\" adı verilen bir eylemdir. 9. Self-Awareness: Araştırmalar, fillerin ayna karşısında kendilerini tanıyabildiğini, yani benlik farkındalığına sahip olduklarını göstermiştir. Bu özelliğe çok az hayvan türü sahiptir ve genellikle primatlar, yunuslar ve bazı kuş türleri ile ilişkilendirilir. Filler, bu saydığımız özelliklerin yanı sıra birçok ezber bozan davranışlarıyla ve zekalarıyla sürekli olarak araştırmacıları şaşırtmaya devam etmektedir. Onların sadece fiziksel güçleri değil, aynı zamanda zihinsel kapasiteleri ve sosyal karmaşıklıkları da hayvan krallığında benzersiz bir yer tutmaktadır."},{"prompt":"Kargaların ilginç ve az bilinen özellikleri hakkında bilgi verir misin","completion":"Kargalar zekaları ve adaptasyon yetenekleriyle tanınan etkileyici kuşlardır. İşte kargalar hakkında az bilinen bazı ilginç özellikler: 1. Araç Kullanımı: Kargalar, araç kullanabilen nadir hayvan türlerinden biridir. Bilimsel deneylerde, yiyeceğe ulaşmak için özel olarak şekillendirilmiş telleri veya dal parçalarını kullanabildikleri gözlemlenmiştir. 2. Karmaşık Sosyal Yapı: Kargalar karmaşık sosyal yapılar oluştururlar. Grup halinde yaşar, birlikte avlanır ve topluluk içinde bir hiyerarşiye sahip olabilirler. Ayrıca, ölen bir karganın etrafında toplanıp, ne olduğunu anlamaya çalışan \\"cenaze törenleri\\" düzenledikleri gözlemlenmiştir. 3. Oyun Davranışları: Kargalar sadece hayatta kalma odaklı davranışlar geliştirmekle kalmaz, aynı zamanda oyun oynamaktan da keyif alırlar. Kar yağdığında kayarak oynadıkları veya havada hava akrobasisi yaptıkları görülmüştür. 4. Yüz Tanıma Yeteneği: Araştırmalar, kargaların insan yüzlerini tanıyabildiğini ve hatta insanların onlara karşı sergiledikleri olumlu veya olumsuz davranışları hatırlayabildiğini ortaya koymuştur. Hatta zararlı buldukları insanlara karşı uyarı çığlıkları atabilirler. 5. Karmaşık İletişim: Kargalar, hem sesli hem de bedensel olarak karmaşık bir iletişim sistemine sahiptir. Çeşitli çağrı sesleri ve hareketleri ile hem tehlike uyarısında bulunabilirler hem de diğer kargalarla bilgi paylaşabilirler. 6. Planlama Yeteneği: Bazı deneyler, kargaların geleceği planlayabildiğini ve yiyeceklerini saklayabildiğini göstermiştir. Yiyecek saklama davranışları sırasında, diğer kargalar tarafından gözetleniyor olabileceklerini düşünerek, saklama yerlerini değiştirebilir veya hile yapabilirler. 7. Otonomi: Kargalar, yas değişikliklerine uyma konusunda muazzam bir yeteneğe sahiptirler. Bir kaynaktan yiyecek çalmak gibi zorlu yaşam koşullarının üstesinden gelmek için uyarlanabilir davranışlar sergileyebilirler. 8. Uzun Süreli Hatırlama: Kargaların, gördükleri nesneleri veya yaşadıkları olayları uzun süre hatırlayabildikleri bilinmektedir. Bu yetenek, hem yiyecek saklama yerlerini hatırlamakta hem de sosyal ilişkilerde faydalıdır. 9. Kendi Kendine Kontrol: Kargalar, ödül erteleme testinde kendilerini kontrol etme yeteneğine sahip olduklarını göstermiştir, yani daha büyük bir ödül için anlık tatmin duygusunu bir süre erteleyebilirler. Bu baş döndürücü özellikleriyle, kargalar, zekalarıyla hayranlık uyandıran ve birçok üstünlükleri olan canlılar olarak ön plana çıkarlar. İnsan zekasının bazı yönlerine paralel olan bu özellikler, kargaları hayvanlar aleminde özellikle ilgi çekici hale getirir ve onların daha detaylı incelenmesine yönelik süregelen bir merak uyandırır."},{"prompt":"J’ai un test sur les verbes irrégulier peut tu m’interroger sur les verbe irrégulier pour que je les apprenne","completion":"Bien sûr, je peux te poser des questions sur les verbes irréguliers en français pour t'aider à réviser.

There’s one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily’s powers, and if she can’t, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it’d be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls. Regressing will give Sapphire penalties to her future rolls. Have a \\"system of trust\\" that concerns how various parties at the orphanage deem Sapphire and how reliable and capable she is, and depends on rolls and actions, Sapphire can increase or decrease her worth in the eyes of said parties. The parties are: Lily; the headmistress; the younger orphanage kids; the older orphanage kids.","completion":"Welcome, Sapphire, to the old, stone-walled orphanage that you once called home. The aged but ever-warm headmistress greets you with open arms, her eyes a mix of relief and concern. The children run about the courtyard, their laughter a familiar melody among the rustling leaves of the old oak tree. Yet there is a shadow of unease that lingers – a mystery tied to little Lily and her strange, unchecked powers. To track Sapphire's success in managing Lily, we'll use a simple d20 system. The outcomes of your rolls will dictate the following: - 1-5: Failure with significant regression for Sapphire and corresponding age gain for Lily. - 6-10: Partial failure with minor regression for Sapphire and a slight increase in Lily's age. - 11-15: Success, but with some difficulty or complication attached. - 16-20: Complete success, and possible improvement in trust from the various parties. Trust System: - Each party starts neutral toward Sapphire. - Actions and outcomes will move their perception up or down, which can affect future interactions and rolls. - Trust levels range from Very Low, Low, Neutral, High, to Very High. With the headmistress's plea for assistance in your heart, your first task is to observe Lily while keeping a safe distance to see if you can discern any patterns or triggers for her powers. Please roll the d20 to determine how well Sapphire does with her initial observation. (Tell me your roll result, and we'll continue the story based on that.)"},{"prompt":"10","completion":"With a roll of 10, Sapphire cautiously approaches as she watches Lily play. She can't help but note the way the other children seem wary to get too close to the toddler, their eyes flicking to the now more babyish forms of the children that were once older than Lily. Sapphire's caution pays off to an extent; she manages to avoid any direct regression herself, but the air still shivers with uncontrolled magic around Lily, a testament to the unpredictability of the situation. She does note, however, that Lily's powers seem to flare up particularly when she's feeling strong emotions. The headmistress observes Sapphire's careful analysis and appreciates her cautious approach, giving her a slight nod of approval. The younger orphanage kids, meanwhile, are a bit reassured by Sapphire's presence, but they remain on edge, having seen what can happen with Lily. The older kids watch from a distance, unsure of what to make of the situation and Sapphire's return. Trust Levels after initial observation: - Lily: Neutral (unaware of Sapphire's intentions) - Headmistress: Slightly above Neutral (cautious approval) - Younger Orphans: Neutral (watching warily) - Older Orphans: Neutral (reserved judgment) As Sapphire continues to monitor Lily, the headmistress asks her to try engaging with Lily, hoping that some direct interaction might help them better understand the child's powers. She suggests perhaps reading a story or playing a simple game to keep Lily's emotions stable, which might reduce the risk of a magical outburst. Please roll the d20 again to see how successful Sapphire is at engaging Lily without incident."},{"prompt":"14","completion":"Rolling a 14, Sapphire takes a deep breath, steeling her nerves to engage with Lily. She remembers a favorite storybook from her youth and gently invites Lily to sit with her under the old oak tree for storytime. As they settle down with the book opened wide between them, Lily's eyes sparkle with interest. With each turn of the page and every carefully enunciated word, Lily becomes more entranced by the tale, her attention firmly on the story rather than her surroundings. The other children begin to inch closer, drawn by Sapphire's soothing voice and the magic of the story, rather than Lily's power. This subtle success isn't lost on those around Sapphire. Lily is momentarily pacified and connected with her on a level that hasn't been reached before, showing the potential for building a bond that could help in managing her powers. The others at the orphanage begin to take notice. The headmistress nods with a rare smile, the younger kids glance at Sapphire with hope, and even the older orphans soften, beginning to respect the effort she is putting into this delicate situation. Trust Levels after storytime: - Lily: Slightly above Neutral (enjoying the engagement) - Headmistress: High (pleased with Sapphire's initiative) - Younger Orphans: Slightly above Neutral (gaining hope) - Older Orphans: Slightly above Neutral (beginning to trust) Lily claps happily as the story concludes, seemingly in a good mood. Sapphire senses that now might be a good time to introduce some structured play that could help channel Lily's energies more safely. With this in mind, Sapphire decides to initiate a game that involves all the kids but keeps Lily's interactions predictable and under control. What game does Sapphire choose, and will she be able to implement it without incident? Please roll the d20 to determine the outcome of this new strategy."},{"prompt":"5","completion":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire's well-intended plan faces a significant challenge. She proposes a game of \\"Magical Statues,\\" a harmless game where children must freeze in place when she says a magic word. She hopes this will keep Lily focused and stationary, minimizing the chances of her unknowingly using her powers. Unfortunately, the game proves too stimulating for little Lily. The excitement of freezing and unfreezing appears to bring a surge of emotion from the child, intertwining with her abilities. Before Sapphire realizes what’s happening, she feels a strange sensation envelope her. When the moment passes, she notices with dismay that her clothes hang looser on her frame. Looking down at her hands and feet, Sapphire realizes they're smaller, more delicate—her age has regressed. She can't be sure by how much without looking in a mirror, but the murmurs from the other kids clearly indicate that the change is noticeable. Lily, on the other hand, seems slightly taller, her features maturing just a bit as she absorbs years from Sapphire. With this unintentional exchange, Lily is giggling blissfully, unaware of the consequences of her actions. Trust Levels after the game goes awry: - Lily: Neutral (still oblivious to her influence) - Headmistress: Neutral (concerned by Sapphire's regression) - Younger Orphans: Lower than Neutral (scared and uncertain) - Older Orphans: Neutral (worried but not blaming Sapphire) The older kids quickly rush in to help, bringing Sapphire back to the headmistress. There's an urgent discussion about what to do next, as they must find a way to prevent further unintentional aging transfers without isolating Lily or causing her distress. Roll once more to determine how much Sapphire has regressed, and we will see what new strategies might arise from this setback. - Rolling 1-10 means a significant regression of several years. - Rolling 11-20 means a minor regression of just a year or two."},{"prompt":"9","completion":"With a roll of 9, Sapphire feels the weight of her regression settling in. Her voice, when she speaks, has a higher pitch, and her movements are those of someone younger—multiple years have been stripped away from her. It takes a moment for the reality to sink in; she's likely around the age of 12 now. She can tell by the way her clothes loosely puddle around her smaller stature. The headmistress is sympathetic but deeply concerned, ushering Sapphire away to find something more fitting for her to wear. She also begins considering stricter measures to protect the rest of the children and Sapphire from further regressions. Lily remains unaware of her role in what's occurred, now seemingly older – approximately 5-years-old – and struggling to comprehend the upset she can sense around her. Sapphire's sudden change in age only feeds into the other children's growing fears about Lily’s unbridled power. Trust Levels adjust accordingly: - Lily: Confused, Slightly below Neutral (feeling the tension) - Headmistress: Neutral (worried for Sapphire's well-being and the safety of others) - Younger Orphans: Low (fearful of further age regression) - Older Orphans: Neutral (concerned but understanding that Sapphire is a victim, too) After being redressed, Sapphire encounters her reflection. Her maturity, experience, and mental state remain intact, but looking so young again is jarring. She knows she must quickly establish a plan to regain control and protect herself and the others without causing harm to Lily or ostracizing the innocent girl. Sapphire decides to talk with the older orphans and the headmistress to come up with a solution. Perhaps a combined effort or an older child acting as a 'buddy' to Lily can help mitigate the risks. It’s essential to reinforce that emotional upsets trigger the problematic effects and to manage the environment accordingly.

The headmistress, while deeply concerned for Sapphire's well-being, is finding it difficult to take advice and strategy from someone who now looks like just another child in the orphanage. Her once authoritative presence has been diminished, and she is no longer seen as a peer but as one of the many who need protection and guidance. The older orphans, meanwhile, are conflicted. They remember Sapphire as an older figure, but faced with her now as a contemporary, some struggle to relate as they did before. Whispered conversations break out among them, creating a divide in the ranks; some feel empathy, wanting to help both Sapphire and Lily, while others are fearful of becoming the next victim of Lily's uncontrolled power. Trust Levels shift once more: - Lily: Low (feeling even more isolated and sensing the distrust) - Headmistress: Neutral (uncertain how to include Sapphire in plans) - Younger Orphans: Very Low (anxiety and lack of faith increasing) - Older Orphans: Below Neutral (undecided and apprehensive) Despite the setbacks, Sapphire knows she can't give up. If anything, her situation has given her a unique insight into the challenges they face. She firmly believes that neither she nor Lily can be left to navigate this alone. She resolves to try a different approach. Maybe if she can show great care and understanding towards Lily—by playing games that are less stimulating, creating a daily routine that offers firm structure and minimizing surprises—she might avoid triggers for unintended age regression. The key is to keep Lily feeling safe and calm so that her power doesn't respond to negative emotions. Before daring to approach Lily again, let's see if Sapphire can regain any semblance of control and authority, to whatever extent possible, in her current form. Roll the d20 once more to find out if Sapphire can adapt her strategy and start rebuilding trust."},{"prompt":"15","completion":"Rolling a 15, Sapphire finds a renewed sense of determination surging within her. Despite her youthful exterior, her resolve and her knowledge remain as strong as ever. She approaches the challenge with a mix of compassion and leadership, drawing on her own experiences as an orphan to connect with the children and to regain some semblance of control. With the help of the headmistress, she crafts a careful routine for Lily that involves regular, calming activities – things like coloring, simple puzzles, and supervised interaction with certain animals from the nearby woods that are known to be gentle. These activities are designed to keep Lily's mood level and to avoid the emotional spikes that trigger her dangerous power. Sapphire's approach has a visible effect. Lily responds well to the routine, finding comfort in the predictability of her days. The other children notice the positive changes too, and while the fear of Lily's abilities hasn't vanished, there's a lightening of the mood among them as incidents become fewer and more spaced out. The older orphans begin to come around as well, especially as they see Sapphire using her own experience to help Lily. They start to remember all that Sapphire did before her regression and warm up to her once again, seeing past her youthful appearance and respecting her clear efforts to help. Trust Levels reflect Sapphire's successful adaptation: - Lily: Neutral (responding well to structured activities and care) - Headressmistress: High (impressed by Sapphire's adaptability and maturity) - Younger Orphans: Slightly above Low (beginning to feel more secure) - Older Orphans: Slightly above Neutral (recognizing Sapphire's capabilities) With the calming routine in place and a slight shift in the atmosphere of the orphanage, Sapphire has a moment to reflect on her next move. Her priority remains to manage Lily's power and, if possible, find a way to restore the age she's lost so she can fully reclaim her position among the orphans and the headmistress. To try and learn more about Lily's abilities – their origin, potential cures, or ways to reverse the effects – Sapphire decides to delve into the headmistress' library, a dusty room filled with all manners of books, scrolls, and artifacts, some from long-forgotten times. Roll the d20 to determine what Sapphire might uncover in her research."},{"prompt":"2","completion":"With a roll of a 2, Sapphire's foray in the headmistress' library proves to be more challenging than she had hoped. Although the library is filled with vast knowledge, the categorization is far from logical, and many tomes are written in old or arcane languages that now seem just out of Sapphire's reach, their meanings elusive to her regressed state of mind. Hours pass, during which Sapphire leafs through various manuscripts filled with esoteric symbols and cryptic text. Not only does she struggle to comprehend the complex content, but a creeping fatigue from the day’s events begins to weigh on her, further hampering her ability to concentrate. She manages to find a few references to age magic, but nothing concrete enough to offer a solution or even a clue as to how to control or reverse Lily's powers. Her quest for answers remains unfulfilled, leading to a mix of personal frustration and a growing fear that she might not be able to find a way to regain her lost years. The headmistress and the orphans, oblivious to the specifics of Sapphire’s struggles within the library, nevertheless notice her dogged determination and tireless efforts. While they can’t provide the insights Sapphire so fervently seeks, their trust in her effort and intention remains, even if tinged with concern for her well-being. Trust Levels adjust slightly: - Lily: Neutral (oblivious to the research efforts) - Headmistress: High (recognizing the commitment, despite the lack of results) - Younger Orphans: Neutral (still looking to Sapphire for stability) - Older Orphans: Neutral (shared concern for Sapphire's frustration) As the day comes to a close, Sapphire knows she will need help if she is to unravel this magical mystery and restore herself and the others affected by Lily’s powers. In the morning, she plans to have a discussion with the headmistress about possibly seeking external aid—be it a learned mage, a wise hermit, or even rumors of a nearby healer. Roll the d20 one last time to see how the conversation unfolds and if it will lead them on the path toward finding a solution."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: Compliments, This new year will grant us successes and breakthroughs that we couldn't achieve in 2023, this 2024 is our year of greater achievement, fulfilment, and we shall dwell in good health, peace & happiness by the mercy of God.

En anglais par exemple, un grand nombre de verbes changent de forme au passé simple et au participe passé d'une manière qui est imprévisible, et donc ils doivent être appris individuellement. Nous pouvons catégoriser les verbes irréguliers anglais en trois niveaux de difficulté pour l'apprentissage : simples, moyens et durs, en fonction de leur régularité et de la fréquence de leur utilisation. **Verbes Irreguliers Simples** Ces verbes ont souvent des formes très courantes ou des modifications minimales entre le présent, le passé et le participe passé qui les rendent plus faciles à mémoriser. Exemples : - Put (mettre) - Présent : put - Passé simple: put - Participe passé : put - Cut (couper) - Présent : cut - Passé simple: cut - Participe passé : cut **Verbes Irreguliers Moyens** Ces verbes ont souvent un changement de voyelle du présent au passé et parfois des changements de voyelle entre le passé simple et le participe passé. Exemples : - Sleep (dormir) - Présent : sleep - Passé simple: slept - Participe passé : slept - Speak (parler) - Présent : speak - Passé simple: spoke - Participe passé : spoken **Verbes Irreguliers Difficiles** Ces verbes ont souvent des changements de voyelle et/ou des changements consonantiques, et leurs formes peuvent être très différentes les unes des autres. Ils peuvent aussi avoir des formes totalement uniques qu'il faut mémoriser. Exemples : - Go (aller) - Présent : go - Passé simple: went - Participe passé : gone - Write (écrire) - Présent : write - Passé simple: wrote - Participe passé : written **Conseils pour Apprendre les Verbes Irreguliers** - Commencez par les formes les plus fréquemment utilisées. - Apprenez-les par catégories ou par groupes qui partagent des motifs similaires. - Utilisez des cartes de mémorisation (flashcards) ou des applications d'apprentissage des langues. - Pratiquez régulièrement en lisant, écrivant et parlant. **Fiche Notion: Les Verbes Irreguliers en Anglais** - Non conformes aux règles standards de conjugaison. - Chaque verbe a sa propre conjugaison qu'il faut mémoriser. - Classés en simples, moyens et difficiles pour un apprentissage graduel. - Apprendre par l'usage constant dans différentes phrases et contextes. - Utiliser des ressources pédagogiques pour renforcer la mémoire.

Полуорк [Half-orc], Следопыт [Ranger] - УБИЙЦА МОНСТРОВ, Предыстория: Моряк [Sailor] 3. Фэйри [Fairy], Паладин [Paladin] - КЛЯТВА ПРЕДАННОСТИ, Предыстория: Мудрец [Sage] - Астроном. 4. Кованый [Warforged], Плут [Rogue] - ФАНТОМ, Предыстория: Прислужник [Acolyte]","completion":"Эта группа авантюристов из DnD весьма разнообразна и интересна благодаря своему составу и комбинациям классов и фонов. Вот более детальная оценка каждого из них: 1. Гоблин-Варвар (Путь предка-хранителя / Шарлатан) – У этого гоблина, как предполагается, есть связи с духами его предков, что может пригодиться во многих ситуациях на игровую сессию, предоставляя поддержку и защиту команде. Предыстория шарлатана добавляет интересные возможности для ролеплея, включающие обман и подделку, что может привести к интересным сюжетным моментам и облегчить команде кое-какие моменты благодаря поддельным документам. 2. Полуорк-Следопыт (Убийца монстров / Моряк) – Полуорк, скорее всего, вносит в группу свою физическую мощь и отличные навыки выживания, плюс специализация на убийстве монстров. Предыстория моряка может предложить дополнительные знания навигации и плытья, что пригодится, если приключение зайдёт в морские или речные зоны. 3. Фэйри-Паладин (Клятва преданности / Мудрец) – Фэйри как паладин с клятвой преданности может стать удивительно мощным защитником добродетели, благодаря магическим способностям расы и сильным обязательствам класса. Фон мудреца в связке с специализацией астронома предложит интересную глубину персонажа и, возможно, дополнительную мудрость или астрологические знания, полезные для навигации или даже во время боя. 4. Кованый-Плут (Фантом / Прислужник) – Кованые приносят в игру уникальную динамику из-за их природы искусственно созданных существ. Как плут, они могут быть более чем способными к скрытности и ловкости, а специализация фантом добавит элементы связи с миром мёртвых. В качестве прислужника кованый мог иметь опыт работы для храма или религиозной организации, что может открыть для команды дополнительные религиозные связи или даже доступ к священным текстам и ритуалам."},{"prompt":"А в целом о группе? Их взаимодействии? Плюсы и минусы команды?","completion":"В целом группа представляет собой интересное смешение разнообразных классов и рас с уникальными бэксториз и способностями, что создаёт как плюсы, так и минусы в их потенциальном взаимодействии. **Плюсы команды:** 1. **Разнообразие способностей:** Группа имеет представителей почти всех основных ролей: танк (гоблин-варвар), лечение и поддержка (фэйри-паладин), дальний бой и выживание (полуорк-следопыт), скрытные операции и ловкость рук (кованый-плут). Это даёт им хорошие шансы на успех в разнообразных ситуациях. 2. **Интригующий потенциал для ролеплея:** Сочетание необычных рас и классов делает интеракции внутри группы и с внешним миром очень интересными. Прошлые жизни персонажей предоставят много основ для глубоко проработанных отношений как между членами команды, так и с НПС. 3. **Дополнительные навыки:** Фоны персонажей обеспечивают дополнительные навыки, которые могут быть полезны в неожиданных обстоятельствах, например, знание морских дел, способности шарлатана или астрономические знания. **Минусы команды:** 1. **Потенциальное отсутствие согласованности:** В такой разнообразной группе может возникнуть конфликт интересов или стилей ведения игры, что может привести к внутренним разногласиям и затруднить принятие решений. 2. **Индивидуалистские тенденции:** Некоторые персонажи вроде шарлатана и прислужника, возможно, привыкли работать в одиночку или имеют скрытые мотивы, что может вызвать проблемы в доверии и командной работе. 3. **Нестандартные расы:** Фэйри и кованый могут столкнуться с предубеждениями, особенно в мирах, где их расы встречаются редко или считаются подозрительными. Чтобы группа действовала эффективно, ей потребуется найти общие цели и научиться доверять друг другу, несмотря на разные прошлые и предпочтения. Возможны конфликты, но именно они и делают игру запоминающейся и интересной, вынуждая игроков искать творческие пути для решения проблем. Главное – чтобы мастер игры смог вписать разнообразные элементы команды в сюжет, тогда их приключения обещают быть увлекательными."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

The early morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow on the walls of his room. He sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes, trying to cling to the strange images that were rapidly fading from his memory. As Cammy tried to gather his thoughts, the door creaked open, and his younger sister, Lily, shuffled in. She was a plump girl with a cherubic face, her eyes bleary and crusted with the remnants of sleep, her hair a wild tangle around her face. “Cam? You alright?” Lily asked with a yawn, concern lining her sleepy features. “I heard you moving around. Bad dream?” Cammy glanced at his sister, a wisp of a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth despite the unsettled feeling lingering within him. “Yeah, just a weird dream. Nothing to worry about, Lil,” he replied, his tone gentle. Lily padded across the room in her slippers and plopped onto the edge of Cammy’s bed, the mattress dipping under her weight. “Tell me,” she insisted, her curiosity getting the better of her. “It’s silly, really. I dreamt that Chun Li—yeah, the character from the video game—somehow climbed out of her skin and leaped away. Like she was shedding it or something,” Cammy explained, chuckling awkwardly at how bizarre it sounded out loud. Lily laughed, the sound brightening the room. “That is crazy. But dreams are supposed to be crazy, right? It’s all over now,” she reassured him, placing a comforting hand on his arm and calling him Cam with the familiarity that only a sibling could get away with. Cammy frowned slightly, the use of his nickname stirring a vague sense of dissonance for a moment. “Cam…” he echoed, the familiarity of the short form surfacing memories and feelings he couldn’t quite place. “Right, Cam. That’s me.” Lily smiled at him warmly. “You remember. Good. You okay? You’re looking a bit lost there.” Cammy gathered himself, the morning now fully taking hold. “I’m fine, Lil. Thanks. Just need a moment to wake up fully,” he replied, shaking off the remnants of his dream. Conversation flowed between them, turning towards plans for the day and the aroma of breakfast which started to waft in from the kitchen. They roused themselves from the comfort of Cammy’s bed, ready to start the day, the strangeness of the night slowly dissipating like the mists of morning. As they left the room, Lily couldn’t resist teasing her brother one more time. “Just watch out for any video game characters trying to escape their skins, okay?” Cammy laughed, a full genuine sound, as he nudged her playfully. “Will do, sis. Will do.” And with that, they made their way to the kitchen, leaving the strange dream and odd sense of dissonance behind, ready to embrace the warmth and love of their family home, whatever imaginary trials they may have faced in the world of dreams."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but forget the mouth thing.

Her cheeks were full and rosy, her eyelids heavy with sleep, and her hair in a mess of curls around her head. \\"What's wrong, Cam?\\" she asked through a sleepy yawn, rubbing her crusty eyes. \\"Did you have a nightmare or something?\\" Cammy gave her a half-smile, the remnants of his dream still nipping at his consciousness. \\"Something like that, Lil,\\" he replied. \\"Just a strange dream, but I'm fine.\\" Undeterred by his reassurances, Lily trudged to his bed and settled down beside him. \\"Tell me about it,\\" she insisted, her innate curiosity taking over. He laughed, albeit a bit awkwardly, as he recounted his dream. \\"Well, I dreamt that Chun Li, you know from the game we used to play? She just... unzipped herself from her body, then bounced away. Like it was a costume.\\" Lily chuckled at the absurdity of it all. \\"Wow, that is nuts. But you know how dreams are—anything goes!\\" She gave his arm a comforting squeeze while addressing him with his nickname, \\"It's over now, Cam.\\" The mention of his nickname triggered a fleeting dissonance in Cammy's mind, but he shook it off. \\"Yeah, 'Cam,' that's me,\\" he agreed, with a sense that there was something more to the dream, a sense of playfulness or perhaps an echo of a past adventure. Picking up on her brother's odd reaction, Lily's smile grew teasingly. \\"Hey, it's just a dream. But it sounds like a pretty cool idea, doesn't it? Unzipping your body and being someone else for a while?\\" Their banter was cut short by the sound of sizzling from the kitchen and the aroma of breakfast. Cammy's dream was quickly slipping away, replaced by the comforting reality of the start of a new day. Lily hopped off the bed. \\"Come on, let's get some breakfast. Talking about unzipping and video game characters on an empty stomach is making my head spin.\\" Cammy nodded and followed, feeling more grounded with each step he took away from the bed. As they exited the room, a playful thought crossed his mind, and he turned to Lily with a grin. \\"You know, if we ever figure out how to unzip from reality, I'm calling dibs on being the first to leap out as a game hero.\\" Lily laughed, reaching out to ruffle his hair. \\"You'd do that. And I'd be right there to capture it all on camera, 'Cam,' the indomitable hero.\\" They walked out of the room together, their laughter mingling with the sounds of their lively home.

Did you have a bad dream?\\" “Just a weird one, nothing bad,” Cammy replied with a reassuring tone as he managed a faint smile. Unconvinced but ever so persistent, Lily plopped down on the corner of his bed, her weight causing it to creak comfortably. \\"Spill it, I wanna hear this ‘weird dream’ of yours,\\" she demanded, her voice tinged with the warmth of sisterly affection. With a chuckle, Cammy shook his head but indulged her. \\"Alright, prepare for absurdity. You know Chun Li, right?

Here is an expanded content under the specified subheading with embedded Harvard references: **1.1 The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention** Physiotherapeutic endeavors have traditionally been reliant upon the tactile expertise of practitioners who apply an assortment of manual techniques to address and ameliorate musculoskeletal afflictions. This manual paradigm, while undeniably beneficial, is constrained by inherent limitations such as therapist availability and patient adherence (Pomeroy et al., 2006). Increasingly, the international foray into rehabilitation sciences has witnessed the infusion of robotics, intended to surmount these constraints. Particularly, humanoid robots are being tailored to facilitate complex, patient-specific movements, imbuing the rehabilitation process with a level of precision and consistency scarcely achievable by human counterparts alone (Krebs et al., 2007). Within this global vista, countries pioneering in healthcare technology have made significant strides forward. Japan, for instance, has invested heavily in the deployment of robots as therapeutic aides to surmount the burgeoning demands of an aging population, with robots like HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) enhancing patient recovery through the facilitation of motion and offering support in muscle weakness rehabilitation (Suzuki et al., 2015). Europe, not to be outdone, has incubated projects like the I-SUPPORT, which envisions robotic systems aiding in bathing tasks, reflective of the intimacy and trust placed in such technologies (Cavallo et al., 2018). Humanoid robotics in rehabilitation stands on the precipice of a vast landscape of possibilities. The NAO robot, in particular, embodies this frontier, bearing the potential to engage in socially assistive tasks that extend beyond mere physical therapy and into the realm of emotional and psychological well-being, constituting a holistic approach to patient recuperation (Rabbitt et al., 2015). Garnering insight from global initiatives, this research intends to elucidate the extent to which humanoid robots can not only replicate traditional physiotherapist roles but also innovate them, rendering a future where machines and humans coalesce in the service of healing. **References:** - Pomeroy, V.

The result is an entry for the section \\"1. Introduction and Literature Review for [Humanoid Robot as an Assistant Physiotherapist]\\". --- Capaciously cognizant of the exigencies begotten by the inexorable progression of medical demographics and their attendant tribulations on the provision of physiotherapeutic services, it becomes imperative to usher in the vanguard of innovation symbolized through the deployment of humanoid robots in clinical settings. The robotic assistant, such as the NAO, is ontologically engineered to execute a cornucopia of physiotherapeutic tasks with unwavering precision and indefatigability, juxtaposed against the somatic and psychic toll enacted upon human purveyors of such care (Gupta et al., 2020). To fathom the full breadth of this robotic odyssey, it behooves us to extrapolate upon the mosaic of traditional modalities intersecting the incipient utilization of robotic aids in physiotherapy and concurrently distill the essence of accompanying research paradigms. Indubitably, Rodríguez-Fernández et al. (2019) articulate that the sine qua non of efficacious physiotherapeutic outcomes hinges upon the sustained, iterative, and meticulous enactment of prescribed exercises. Humanoid robots, with their proclivity for precision and compliance with programmed directives, emerge as quintessential conduits for this therapeutic paradigm. The literature evinces an increasing compendium of successful deployments wherein humanoid robots pivotally contribute to upper limb recuperation, engender advancements in gait rehabilitation, and serve as meticulous architects of lower limb massage protocols (Veerbeek et al., 2017). Verily, these silicon sentinels of health care do not eclipse the roles of physiotherapists but rather amalgamate with the clinical tapestry, augmenting its texture with their digital dexterity. Perusing the literature, the meticulous work of Belpaeme et al. (2018) reveals the social aptitudes of humanoid robots, postulating their integration as salubrious syntheses of companionship and rehabilitation. Indeed, the NAO robot’s dexterity in social interaction, as facilitated by its auditory and visual sensors, adds a layer of psycho-emotional succor to the rigorous and oftentimes monochromatic landscape of rehabilitation. In juxtaposition, cautions are sounded by ethical savants who presage the ontological dilemmas broached by robotic integration: the quandaries of patient data security, the enigmatic thresholds of machine autonomy, and the arduous conservation of human touch in the healing arts sire a veritable labyrinth of moral inquiry (Mois, Peca, et al., 2019). Eschewing an exegesis that stymies innovation, a judicious equipoise is necessitated to navigate these ethical chasms, as the literature witnesses a burgeoning quest to tether the technological Prometheus within the confines of moral rectitude and societal well-being.

Introduction and Literature Review for [Humanoid Robot as an Assistant Physiotherapist]** *1.1 The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention* In the ether of physical rehabilitation, the integration of humanoid robotics as adjunct assistants exhibits the transformative potentiality to alleviate healthcare constraints. Recognizing the burgeoning demographic trends and their multidimensional pressure on healthcare systems necessitates innovative approaches to physiotherapy (Gassert & Dietz, 2018). Traditional physiotherapeutic practices, indispensable to patient's recuperation, contend with intrinsic limitations, most notably the constraints related to human resource availability and the attendant burnout amongst practitioners (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005). In this light, humanoid robots such as NAO emerge not as replacements but as vital cogs in the healthcare machinery, endowed with the capacity for constant, meticulous care. *1.2 Research Problem Statement* Advancements in humanoid robotics proffer the beckoning avenues for exploration and integration into the realm of physiotherapeutic intervention. Predicated on the hypothesis that robotic aid could substantially mitigate the extant constraints on healthcare services (Krebs et al., 2018), this literature review serves as the intellectual crucible in which the preeminent functionalities and potentialities of the NAO humanoid robot, tailored to the treatment of upper and lower limb maladies, are smelted and scrutinized. **1. Introduction (Continuation)** The literature expounds on the therapeutic congruence between the robotic iterations and rehabilitative paradigms; thus, realizing the harmonious potential of machine precision in tandem with clinical expertise. This introduction, drawing on the diverse corpus of existing research, seeks to frame the discourse and set the foundation for the consequent exploration of humanoid robots' integration in physiotherapy (Veerbeek et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2020). It esteems the academic dialogues on the ethical implications of deploying robotic entities within inherently human realms, signposting a path for balanced progress that respects the sanctity of human care while embracing the methodical exactitude offered by robotics (Mois, Peca, et al., 2019). Thus, this initial foray into literature functions as both the cornerstone and compass for the ensuing research, guiding the study towards a confluence of empiricism and humane technology. --- **References** - Belpaeme, T., Kennedy, J., Ramachandran, A., Scassellati, B., & Tanaka, F.

Introduction and Literature Review for [Humanoid Robot as an Assistant Physiotherapist]** **In the ether of physical rehabilitation, the integration of humanoid robotics as adjunct assistants exhibits the transformative potentiality to alleviate healthcare constraints. Coupled with the daunting adversities the accelerating pace of aging populations globally exerts on healthcare systems, innovative approaches to physiotherapy are irrefutably necessitated. Irrespective of the indispensability of physiotherapeutic practices, it often finds itself incessantly grappling with inherent restrictions attributable to resource scarcity, namely a disparity in patient-to-therapist ratios, which is further exacerbated by the somatic cumulative fatigue exacted on practitioners across recurrent sessions (Dautenhahn & Werry, 2005). Humanoid robots, such as NAO, herald a prospective pathway to supplement the ubiquitous delivery of efficacious and consistent therapeutic interventions; within this promising context, this study purports to focus on both the utilisation of the NAO robot for the amelioration of the recovery process for those with limb mobility impairments, alongside the systematic investigation of the prevalent restraints within conventional rehabilitation modalities whilst ascertaining the function humanoid robots may serve in the process.** *1.1 The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention* **In continuation of the scintillating premise elucidated heretofore, and as previously alluded to in the abstract, the explication of humanoid robotic applications in physiotherapy beckons a comprehensive review of the current literature to unfurl a taxonomy of extant methodologies and the frontiers of robotic intervention. Embellished by the notion that the rote, repetitive, and structured fabric of physiotherapeutic procedures is amenable to mechanisation (Krebs, et al., 2018), the valiant NAO humanoid robot stands at the vanguard of this therapeutic odyssey, its intrinsic competency to deliver indefatigable, exact, and individualised care denoting a considerable enhancement in catering to the rehabilitative exigencies of those that are beset by limb mobility limitations (Gassert & Dietz, 2018).** *1.2 Research Problem Statement* Upon this bedrock of traditionalist constraints and the promise proffered by technological advents, the question arises: To what extent can humanoid robots like NAO foster a revolution within physiotherapy? The burgeoning literature offers vistas into myriad interventions wherein such robots have adjuvantly bolstered limb rehabilitation, thus, inscribing a novel narrative into the annals of healthcare. Academic dialogues inaugurate an equitable exploration of the manifold challenges and ethical conundrums that accompany this technological insurgency (Mois, Peca, et al., 2019). Our literature review meticulously curates these conversations, proffering a nuanced dissection of the robot as both assistant and aspirant within the physiotherapeutic landscape. **References** - Dautenhahn, K., & Werry, I.

I will continue the section \\"The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention,\\" including embedded Harvard references. --- **1.1 The Traditional Methods and International Horizon for Robotics Intervention** **In continuation of the scintillating premise elucidated heretofore, the landscape of physiotherapy, historically rooted in the tutelage of hands-on manipulation and personalized care, begins to burgeon with the advent of humanoid robots.** The annals of traditional physiotherapy have long been inscribed with the manual techniques and tailored therapeutic exercises that center the human touch as the cornerstone of effective rehabilitative outcomes (Brooks, 2017). Yet, as the canvas of healthcare broadens under the brushstrokes of technological innovation, a novel vista unveils: a horizon where robotic intervention portends to amplify the clinician's ability to render care. Delving into the contrivances of humanoid robots, one discerns the dawning of an avant-garde era wherein machines, like the lauded NAO, are programmed to emulate, with unprecedented accuracy, the physiotherapeutic protocols erstwhile administered by human specialists (Matarić et al., 2017). **The valiant NAO humanoid robot, imbued with the ability to capture and analyze motion through its sophisticated sensory apparatus, not only propounds an adjunct pathway to conventional therapies but introduces a measure of quantifiable persistency in therapeutic programs (Aminian & Najafi, 2004).** This formidable transitional epoch witnesses robots break the monolith of traditional interventions, encouraging a symbiosis in which automated consistency complements the tailored expertise of therapists. Research heralds the efficacy of robotic intervention aligning with societal trends, with applicability across a myriad of physiotherapeutic domains from stroke recovery to mobility afflictions consequent to age-related musculoskeletal degeneration (Koenig et al., 2011). It postulates that the perennial quest for improved outcomes in physiotherapy may well be advancing towards a collaborative future where robot-assisted therapies are intrinsic (Colombo et al., 2014). Yet, amidst these technological landscapes, one must navigate the international horizon with cognizance of cross-cultural healthcare disparities. The extant literature suggests a precipitous slope between high and low-resource settings—an ontological reflection linking robotics to healthcare equity (Patel et al., 2020). Thus, whilst considering the global scope of robotics intervention, our review accedes to the notion that 'international horizon' is as much about technological dissemination as it is about equitability and contextual suitability (Edwards et al., 2018). **References** - Aminian, K., & Najafi, B.

I look forward to your email and understanding more about the pressing issue you mentioned. Rest assured, your communication will be held in the strictest confidence. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #3, from Doris: Hello, Thanks for your response. I want to say thank you for allowing me to have this conversation with you. I am Mrs. Doris Hussian from Singapore and married to Engineer David Hussian of the Republic of Togo. We were married for 17 years without any child, My husband died in 2018. My husband deposited the sum of 2,500,000 USD (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) with a bank in Republic of Togo before his untimely death in an accident I have been battling with cancer which is in the last stage according to the doctor. I am currently undergoing cancer treatment in the United States of America. I am contacting you concerning my late Husband's funds deposited in his bank before his death. I wish to present you to the bank as the beneficiary/trustee so that you can receive the fund and use it for charity in line with my late husband's wish. I contacted you for this humanitarian work with a conviction in my heart that you will not betray me when the fund arrives into your account. . You may be wondering why I suddenly chose or contacted you, not knowing you and more things about you. Yes the truth is that I have no doubt in GOD, I prayed and fasted and asked God to provide me someone who will have affection for me and help me with a sincere mind to use the fund to do charity. I want you to use 50% of this funds for charity and to the poor and needy, then you will use 30% to build a house of worship for God and finally the remaining 20% of the money will be for you and your family. l made this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that is responsible for the death of my husband in order to have all my late husband's properties. I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death. Now I am in the United States now, also due to my condition I have no hope again because I have overheard my doctor telling one of the nurses about my health and when the surgery will take place. I will be delighted to die peacefully if my desire is achieved by your helping to make sure that this fund is transferred into your bank account as the beneficiary. You will utilize it to help those less privileged children and elderly homes so that they will feel being part of the world. This is all I have to do to thank God almighty for the little life he has given me on this earth since I have few days to leave. As soon as I hear from you, I will forward the bank contact information to you. I have to introduce you to the bank as my late husband's business partner and the beneficiary of the funds. My husband deposited the fund on behalf of his partner, so I can present anybody to the bank as my husband's partner. The BANK is waiting for the release of the FUNDS to the foreign partner whom I will present as my late husband's business partner. I have all the related documents that were issued to my late husband the day of the deposit of the fund in the bank. Also I am sending you this message through my (Nurse) laptop computer. The nurse is taking care of me in the hospital. I am sorry for the delay because the nurse did not come to work in time and there was no place for me to check my mail.Because of my condition the Doctors stopped me from receiving visitors and they took my phones. May the good Lord be with you and your family? I hope to hear from you for more information please. Greetings from Mrs. Doris Hussian. Email #4, from Cameron: Dear Mrs. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for entrusting me with such an incredible and profound responsibility.

Every Thursday at 4 PM, like clockwork, he would shuffle into her understated office, a cozy space with warm lighting and shelves lined with psychology books and knick-knacks from around the world. He found the eclectic decorations oddly comforting, as if the variety of objects represented the multitude of issues they would sift through together. His name was David, a middle-aged man with a life that many would see as mundane. A corporate job, a decent salary, a small apartment in a city where people were too busy with their own lives to notice one another. David often felt lost in the bustle, like a cog in a vast, indifferent machine. That's why he sought therapy: to find a spark, a sense of meaning amidst the day-to-day. The therapist, Dr. Lillian Forsythe, was a tall woman with sharp features softened by her kind eyes and gentle voice. She wore her professionalism like a second skin, always focused and attentive to David's words, the occasional head nod indicating her understanding of his inner turmoil. In today's session, David seemed particularly restless. His hands fidgeted on the arms of his chair as he recounted the same cycle of wake up, work, watch TV, and sleep. It seemed to Dr. Forsythe that their sessions, while helpful, hadn't quite managed to pierce the veil of his deeper existential ennui. Then, in a moment that seemed almost too scripted, Dr. Forsythe took off her glasses and placed them gently in David's lap. He looked up, puzzled, into the eyes that had watched over him for weeks, but they were charged now with an uncharacteristic intensity. \\"You know what, David? I think what you need isn't just reflection. You need excitement,\\" she said. The room seemed to hold its breath; the normal rules of therapist-client decorum hung suspended in the air like dust motes. Before David could respond, Dr. Forsythe reached up and...did something utterly impossible. With smooth but deliberate motions, she appeared to be pulling her head open, like someone removing a helmet. Underneath the therapist he'd come to trust was... another person. No, not just another person—Carol Danvers, or as the world knew her, Captain Marvel. David's mouth opened to speak, but no words came out. He was shocked, disbelieving, and suddenly gripped by the realization that the life he found so dreadfully predictable was anything but. Captain Marvel, in her iconic suit, now stood before him. \\"Life isn't just about routines and schedules, David. It's about finding your own adventure, your own path. The world is full of extraordinary things—you just have to be open to experiencing them.\\" David's heart was pounding, overwhelmed by the surreal turn his therapy session had taken. But as Captain Marvel extended her hand, inviting him to step out of his comfort zone and into a world of new beginnings, he felt a spark, the very thing he had been searching for all along. \\"This is your wakeup call, David. You're stronger than you know, braver than you think, and capable of more than you've ever imagined,\\" Captain Marvel said with a smile that seemed both otherworldly and genuinely human. He took her hand, and in that instant, he was no longer just a man talking to a therapist. He was a man who had talked with a hero, a man filled with a newfound courage to face the unknown, to live life to the fullest, to find his own adventure beyond the therapist's office, beyond the expectations of others, and most importantly, beyond the limits he had once set for himself. The story had become his own to write. And with every step he would take after that fateful session, he would carry the feeling of that extraordinary meeting—a reminder that excitement and wonder can find us, even in the most ordinary of places."},{"prompt":"Further detail on the unmaking.","completion":"The atmosphere within the therapist’s office shifted palpably as Dr. Forsythe removed her glasses and placed them onto David's lap. Her typical composed demeanor transformed into something altogether different—a potent mix of assurance and mystery. As she raised her hands to her head, David felt his breath hitch in tandem with the room's sudden plunge into the surreal. His therapist's fingers glided to the sides of her face, where he had never noticed any seams or indications that the visage before him was anything other than the flesh and bone of a human being. Yet now, those very fingers seemed to catch onto an invisible ledge, a boundary between one reality and another. Dr. Forsythe—or the figure he had always known as Dr. Forsythe—started to pull apart her scalp and face with a measured grace. The motion was unnatural, defying biology and expectation, and yet there was no gore, no grimace of pain, not even the slightest indication of discomfort. Instead, her skin, her very features, seemed to split open with the precision and ease of well-oiled machinery revealing an interior fabric of something too advanced to be of Earthly origin. David watched, frozen in a mixture of fear, fascination, and disbelief, as beneath the therapist's mask of humanity emerged another face—one incorruptible and strong, striking not only for its beauty but for its undeniable power. The warm light of the room shimmered against the blonde hair now cascading from within the opened visor, and there were the vibrant, commanding eyes that had saved the world more than once in the pages of comic books and on film screens. Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, stood in the room—a stark contrast to the mundanity of David’s life that had pressed upon him so heavily up until that unexpected moment. The shift was more than physical. It was also emotional and psychological, a narrative so extraordinary that it challenged the very concept of reality he had clung to. The 'mask' that had been her face was now nothing more than a silicone appliance resting atop her uniform—a convincing prop to anyone who wasn’t watching the transformation. It begged countless questions: Was the therapy all a ruse? Was she here with a purpose? And why reveal her identity to him? The marvel of the moment far exceeded any excitement David had hoped to kindle in his life through these therapy sessions. This unmaking was not a destruction but a revelation—a metamorphosis from the mundane to the supermundane. This heroic unveiling became a symbol, one that would ripple through David's existence, pushing him to consider the masks he wore day to day and challenging him to peel back the layers of his own life to uncover the excitement hidden beneath.

I was both surprised and intrigued when I received your email, as it is not every day that one gets a message concerning a pressing issue from a stranger halfway across the world. My curiosity has certainly been piqued, and I find myself quite eager to learn more about the matter you wish to discuss. I can only imagine the importance of it since you’ve taken the time to seek assistance beyond your immediate surroundings. Please feel free to share the details with me at your earliest convenience. I am always looking for new ways to engage with others and facilitate solutions to their concerns. Who knows, perhaps there might be a way for me to assist you. I look forward to your email and understanding more about the pressing issue you mentioned. Rest assured, your communication will be held in the strictest confidence. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #3, from Doris: Hello, Thanks for your response. I want to say thank you for allowing me to have this conversation with you. I am Mrs. Doris Hussian from Singapore and married to Engineer David Hussian of the Republic of Togo. We were married for 17 years without any child, My husband died in 2018. My husband deposited the sum of 2,500,000 USD (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) with a bank in Republic of Togo before his untimely death in an accident I have been battling with cancer which is in the last stage according to the doctor. I am currently undergoing cancer treatment in the United States of America. I am contacting you concerning my late Husband's funds deposited in his bank before his death. I wish to present you to the bank as the beneficiary/trustee so that you can receive the fund and use it for charity in line with my late husband's wish. I contacted you for this humanitarian work with a conviction in my heart that you will not betray me when the fund arrives into your account. . You may be wondering why I suddenly chose or contacted you, not knowing you and more things about you. Yes the truth is that I have no doubt in GOD, I prayed and fasted and asked God to provide me someone who will have affection for me and help me with a sincere mind to use the fund to do charity. I want you to use 50% of this funds for charity and to the poor and needy, then you will use 30% to build a house of worship for God and finally the remaining 20% of the money will be for you and your family. l made this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that is responsible for the death of my husband in order to have all my late husband's properties. I do not want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death. Now I am in the United States now, also due to my condition I have no hope again because I have overheard my doctor telling one of the nurses about my health and when the surgery will take place. I will be delighted to die peacefully if my desire is achieved by your helping to make sure that this fund is transferred into your bank account as the beneficiary. You will utilize it to help those less privileged children and elderly homes so that they will feel being part of the world. This is all I have to do to thank God almighty for the little life he has given me on this earth since I have few days to leave. As soon as I hear from you, I will forward the bank contact information to you. I have to introduce you to the bank as my late husband's business partner and the beneficiary of the funds. My husband deposited the fund on behalf of his partner, so I can present anybody to the bank as my husband's partner. The BANK is waiting for the release of the FUNDS to the foreign partner whom I will present as my late husband's business partner. I have all the related documents that were issued to my late husband the day of the deposit of the fund in the bank. Also I am sending you this message through my (Nurse) laptop computer. The nurse is taking care of me in the hospital. I am sorry for the delay because the nurse did not come to work in time and there was no place for me to check my mail.Because of my condition the Doctors stopped me from receiving visitors and they took my phones. May the good Lord be with you and your family? I hope to hear from you for more information please. Greetings from Mrs. Doris Hussian. Email #4, from Cameron: Dear Mrs. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for entrusting me with such an incredible and profound responsibility. It’s truly admirable to see that even in the face of adversity, your spirit is devoted to making a positive impact on the world. Despite our recent acquaintance and the distance between us, I am touched by your faith and determination to follow through with your late husband’s wishes. I cannot fathom the trials you have undergone with your husband’s passing and your own health challenges. I must say, your strength and generosity shine through your words, and it reminds us all to look beyond our circumstances and focus on the legacy we leave behind. I am fully prepared to honor your request and ensure that the funds are used exactly as you’ve envisioned. It would be a privilege to help set up charitable deeds that would put a smile on children’s faces and support the elderly in need. Building a house of worship is indeed a noble undertaking, and I’m inspired by your dedication to both faith and humanity. In regards to the distribution of the funds, the stipulated 50% for charity, 30% for a house of worship, and the remaining 20% for personal use sounds like a well-thought-out plan. I assure you, my intentions are pure, and I am ready to carry this out with the utmost diligence and care. If you could please provide the bank contact information at your earliest convenience, I will take the necessary steps from my end. Understanding the sensitivity of this matter, please rest assured that I will handle everything discreetly and with the level of seriousness it requires.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

If \`texte\` is equal to its reverse, the function returns \`True\` (meaning it's a palindrome); otherwise, it returns \`False\`. \`\`\`python def palindrome2(texte: str): debut = 0 fin = len(texte) - 1 \`\`\` This is the start of the second function \`palindrome2\`, which also checks if a string is a palindrome. It initializes two indices: \`debut\` is set to 0 (the first character), and \`fin\` is set to the last character's index (\`len(texte) - 1\`). \`\`\`python while debut < fin: \`\`\` This line starts a \`while\` loop that will continue as long as the \`debut\` index is less than the \`fin\` index. \`\`\`python if texte[debut] != texte[fin]: return False \`\`\` Inside the loop, if the characters at the positions \`debut\` and \`fin\` are not the same, the function immediately returns \`False\`, because this means that the string is not a palindrome. \`\`\`python else: debut += 1 fin -= 1 \`\`\` If the characters at \`debut\` and \`fin\` are the same, the code enters the \`else\` block, where it moves the \`debut\` index forward by 1 (\`debut += 1\`) and the \`fin\` index backward by 1 (\`fin -= 1\`). This moves the indices closer to the center and prepares for the next comparison of characters. \`\`\`python return True \`\`\` If the loop finishes without returning \`False\`, it means all the corresponding characters from the start and end are the same, so the function returns \`True\`. The word is a palindrome. \`\`\`python texte = input(\\"Saisir un mot :\\") \`\`\` This line prompts the user to input a word, which will be stored in the variable \`texte\`. \`\`\`python if palindrome1(texte): print(f\\"{texte} est palindrome\\") else: print(f\\"{texte} n'est pas palindrome\\") \`\`\` The \`if\` statement uses the function \`palindrome1\` to check if \`texte\` is a palindrome. If it is, it prints out that the word is a palindrome; if it's not, it prints out that the word is not a palindrome.

There’s one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily’s powers, and if she can’t, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it’d be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls. Regressing will give Sapphire penalties to her future rolls. Have a “system of trust” that concerns how various parties at the orphanage deem Sapphire and how reliable and capable she is, and depends on rolls and actions, Sapphire can increase or decrease her worth in the eyes of said parties. The parties are: Lily; the headmistress; the younger orphanage kids; the older orphanage kids.","completion":"Welcome back, Sapphire. As you step through the familiar doors of the orphanage, you can see the headmistress's relieved smile. Despite the cheerful chaos that surrounds you, her eyes betray the strain of recent events. You've arrived just in time. The headmistress quickly ushers you to one side, filling you in on the mysterious situation with little Lily. The orphanage is already adapting to having more babies around, but the fear is palpable: no one wants to become the next victim of Lily's unknowing curse. You quickly agree to help, keen on preventing more accidents and protecting the kids, including Lily herself. **Trust System:** - Lily: Neutral - The headmistress: High Trust - Younger orphanage kids: Neutral - Older orphanage kids: Neutral Your task is daunting but necessary. To keep a better eye on Lily, you decide to engage her in a playful activity, something that will keep her attention and, more importantly, her mysterious power in check. Let's start with you rolling a d20 to see if you successfully manage to keep Lily occupied without incident on the first day. **Roll now.** **Roll Results:** 1-5: Lily’s power slips out, regressing another child, and you receive a minor penalty due to stress. 6-10: You barely manage, accruing no penalties but no trust gain either. 11-15: You succeed and earn trust from the headmistress and older kids. 16-20: You succeed brilliantly, earning trust from everyone, including Lily. **Penalties:** Each failure could result in you regressing by a year or two, which can hinder your roll bonuses and affect your status in the orphanage. **Sapphire's Roll:** Please roll the d20 and share the result."},{"prompt":"6","completion":"With a roll of 6, Sapphire manages to keep Lily occupied, but it's a close call—a few times you catch her staring intently at one of the younger orphans, and you have to quickly engage her attention with a toy or a game. You finish the day feeling like you've just avoided a disaster. The atmosphere in the orphanage is tense but stable, and the headmistress seems to appreciate your commitment to preventing further incidents. However, there's no significant gain in trust from any of the parties—everyone is still watching to see if your return will make a positive difference in the long term. **Trust System Update:** - Lily: Neutral - The headmistress: High Trust (maintained) - Younger orphanage kids: Neutral - Older orphanage kids: Neutral **Next Steps:** Determined to improve the situation, you decide to organize a small activity, focusing on the older children while still keeping Lily close by. These older kids are wary; they know about Lily's power and are concerned about how safe they are, even with you there. Let's roll to see if your activity improves the situation and builds trust with the older kids. **Roll the d20 again.** **Roll Results:** 1-5: The activity doesn’t go as planned, decreasing trust from the older kids. 6-10: The activity somewhat engages the older kids, stabilizing trust. 11-15: The activity is a success and raises your trustworthiness among the older kids. 16-20: The activity is a big hit, greatly improving trust with all of the older orphans. **Sapphire's Roll:** Please roll the d20 and share the outcome."},{"prompt":"3","completion":"With a roll of 3, the carefully planned activity for the older kids doesn't quite take off. Perhaps it's the underlying nervousness about Lily's presence or perhaps the older kids are simply finding it hard to focus with so much concern about regressing in age. Either way, the activity falters, and the children's attention quickly dissipates. The older kids start to whisper among themselves, casting furtive glances at Lily, and you can feel the trust they might have had in your ability to control the situation starting to wane. The headmistress notices the shift in mood and gives you a sympathetic but worried look, knowing that the stability of the orphanage relies on all the children feeling safe and cared for. **Trust System Update:** - Lily: Neutral - The headmistress: Medium Trust (decreased) - Younger orphanage kids: Neutral - Older orphanage kids: Low Trust (decreased) Sapphire now needs to reassess her approach. It seems focusing on Lily and the younger children might be more effective in preventing accidents and building trust. It's time to take some drastic measures to ensure that Lily's power doesn't accidentally trigger again. The immediate task is to create a safe environment for Lily where she can be closely supervised. Roll a d20 to see if Sapphire can create a suitable space where Lily's powers can be kept in check without causing any further regression accidents. Remember that these repeated failures are starting to take a toll on Sapphire's confidence, and another failure might have direct consequences on her ability to manage the situation. **Roll Results:** 1-5: An accident occurs, and Sapphire finds herself regressed by a few years, making the situation more difficult. 6-10: Sapphire manages to avert disaster, but it's clear that this is not a long-term solution. 11-15: Sapphire creates a stable environment, gaining some trust back from the headmistress. 16-20: Sapphire not only secures the environment but also gains a new insight into possibly controlling or at least predicting Lily's powers, increasing trust from all parties. **Sapphire's Roll:** Please roll the d20 and communicate the result."},{"prompt":"13","completion":"With a roll of 13, Sapphire manages to establish a stable environment for Lily. She creates a playful, fenced area that holds Lily's interest and keeps her engaged without isolating her from the other children, thus maintaining a sense of community and oversight. Observing Lily within this controlled space, you start to recognize certain cues that precede the unintentional use of her power, such as a particular look in her eyes or a change in her behavior. This discovery offers a glimmer of hope that with careful observation, the power can be predicted and, hopefully, accidents can be prevented. The headmistress, who's been on edge since the recent turn of events, breathes a little easier upon seeing your efforts yield visible improvement. Trust among those at the orphanage is slowly but surely being restored. **Trust System Update:** - Lily: Neutral - The headmistress: High Trust (improved) - Younger orphanage kids: Neutral - Older orphanage kids: Low Trust (unchanged) Feeling a renewed sense of purpose, Sapphire decides to spend some one-on-one time with Lily in her new area, aiming to deepen her understanding of the little girl's powers. This could prove instrumental in preventing future age-regression incidents and perhaps help Lily learn to control her own ability. Before you start the next phase of your plan, you must roll again to determine how Sapphire's one-on-one time with Lily impacts their relationship and whether or not any more trust can be built with the headmistress and the children in the orphanage. **Roll Results:** 1-5: Sapphire encounters difficulties that result in a setback, and Lily accidentally regresses her slightly. 6-10: Sapphire maintains the current situation, but Lily remains oblivious to her powers. 11-15: Sapphire makes progress with Lily, and her own understanding of the powers increases. Moderate trust is gained. 16-20: Sapphire significantly bonds with Lily, who starts to show signs of awareness regarding her powers. Trust is greatly enhanced. **Sapphire's Roll:** Go ahead and roll the d20 for your next action."},{"prompt":"2","completion":"With a roll of 2, Sapphire's attempt to bond with Lily and understand her powers more deeply is met with an unfortunate setback. During your playtime together in the controlled space, Lily becomes unexpectedly upset, possibly due to an overwhelming rush of attention or just the frustration of a three-year-old. Because of her emotional state, she loses control of her mysterious ability just as you're trying to comfort her. In that vulnerable moment, Sapphire feels a strange sensation wash over her. As Lily's eyes well up with tears, Sapphire's own perspective shifts—quite literally. The fence surrounding the play area seems to have grown taller, and the toys around seem larger. Realizing what's happening, Sapphire's heart races; she's getting younger. By the time Lily's emotions settle, it's clear that Sapphire has regressed. The exact extent of the regression is uncertain, but seeing as the roll resulted in a very low number, the effect is significant. **Trust System Update:** - Lily: Neutral (potentially wary or guilty) - The headmistress: Medium Trust (decreased due to the accident) - Younger orphanage kids: Neutral (potentially confused or concerned) - Older orphanage kids: Very Low Trust (further decreased due to increased concern for their own safety) **Age Regression:** Sapphire was 17, but with a roll of 2, let's say she regresses by 3 years, making her a 14-year-old in both mind and body. This regression will certainly affect her authority and the respect the children have for her, as well as her own confidence. Meanwhile, Lily might have absorbed those years—becoming a 6-year-old now—and although she doesn't fully understand her powers, she could be growing more and more cognizant of their effects. Given the new dynamics, Sapphire must navigate her diminished status while still attempting to fulfill her responsibilities. It's time to develop a new strategy, taking into accounts the physical and social limitations she now faces. Roll one more time to see if a younger Sapphire can find a way to communicate the importance of sticking together and looking out for each other to both younger and older kids, thereby restoring some level of trust and order in the orphanage. This will be crucial for both managing Lily and gaining back some respect. **Roll Results:** 1-5: Sapphire encounters resistance from the children, and her younger age makes it hard to be taken seriously. 6-10: Sapphire manages to stabilize her position somewhat, but additional effort is needed to fully restore trust. 11-15: Despite her younger age, Sapphire shows wisdom beyond her years and gains back a moderate amount of respect and trust. 16-20: Sapphire's youthful enthusiasm and approach resonate with the children. She's seen as a peer leader by the younger kids and gains significant trust from all. **Sapphire's Roll:** Please roll the d20 and share the result."},{"prompt":"5","completion":"With a roll of 5, Sapphire attempts to communicate the importance of unity and mutual protection in the orphanage, but her efforts are somewhat hampered by her regressed age. As a 14-year-old trying to take charge among kids who are now her peers or nearly her age, she struggles with authority. The older kids, in particular, find it hard to take directives from someone who is no longer significantly older or more mature than they are. Despite her genuine intentions and heartfelt speeches, some of the children seem resistant, and her words don't carry the weight they once did. There's a mixture of reactions: while some of the younger children might feel a stronger connection to Sapphire given her closer age, many feel insecure about the protection and leadership she can provide. The incident with Lily has cast a shadow upon Sapphire's role, and the trust she had from all parties is wearing thin. Lily herself might be starting to feel wary or guilty about her uncontrollable power, and that state of emotional turbulence isn't making it any easier to establish a sense of normalcy. **Trust System Update:** - Lily: Neutral (potential for wariness or guilt) - The headmistress: Low Trust (decreased due to the inability to prevent regression) - Younger orphanage kids: Neutral (but potentially more open to Sapphire due to her age) - Older orphanage kids: Low Trust (resistance due to Sapphire's regression) Given the current situation and the recent cascade of setbacks, it's clear that Sapphire will need to find a new approach if she hopes to rebuild trust and secure her role within the orphanage community. She may need to leverage her now closer age to the other children to rally their support and perhaps discover new ways to work alongside them rather than solely in a position of authority. It may also be time to confer with the headmistress for advice or to consider seeking external help or knowledge about Lily's condition, as the current methods for managing her powers have not been sufficient. At this point, further rolls could continue to shape the story, leading to more attempts by Sapphire to adjust to her new reality and regaining the stability of her life and the lives of those in the orphanage. However, since the last roll was a 5, we should bear in mind the persistent difficulties Sapphire faces as she tries to regain her footing and the trust of those depending on her."},{"prompt":"To gain trust with the younger kids, Sapphire tries to play with them and help them with their tasks, like helping them dress and giving them baths. She also does this to show the headmistress she can still be responsible","completion":"Sapphire's decision to engage directly with the younger kids by stepping into a nurturing role is a smart way to regain trust and demonstrate her continued value to the orphanage, despite her own regression in age. By helping them with daily tasks and providing care, she can also rebuild her sense of purpose and show the headmistress her adaptability. Let's roll a d20 to see how effective Sapphire's efforts are in regaining the trust of the younger kids and showcasing her responsibility to the headmistress. **Roll Results:** 1-5: Sapphire's attempts are met with challenges, and mishaps occur that undermine her efforts. 6-10: Some younger kids respond well to Sapphire's help, but it's not enough to significantly alter the overall perception of her capabilities. 11-15: Sapphire's caring approach earns her the appreciation and trust of most younger kids, as well as a nod of approval from the headmistress. 16-20: Sapphire excels in her new role, gaining the affection of the younger kids and significantly improving her standing with the headmistress. **Sapphire's Roll:** Go ahead and roll the d20 and share the result."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"With a roll of 4, Sapphire faces unexpected challenges as she tries to help the younger children. Despite her best intentions and efforts, a few accidents and misunderstandings occur. It might be that the children are not yet accustomed to Sapphire in her new younger role, or perhaps Sapphire is still adjusting to the physical and psychological changes of her own regression. During a particularly trying time giving baths, maybe the water spills, or a child becomes upset by the change in routine. While dressing the kids, some of them might be uncooperative, missing the more authoritative figure Sapphire used to be. These small calamities affirm the concerns of the older children and give the headmistress pause about how effective Sapphire can be in her current state. **Trust System Update:** - Lily: Neutral (possibility of increased wariness due to incidents) - The headmistress: Low Trust (continued concerns about Sapphire's capability) - Younger orphanage kids: Low Trust (due to mishaps) - Older orphanage kids: Very Low Trust (further doubts about safety and order) This latest attempt at regaining trust has seemingly backfired, leaving Sapphire in a challenging position. However, Sapphire is not one to give up easily. She must learn from these experiences, adapt her approach, and possibly seek guidance or assistance to better handle the new dynamics and expectations. Sapphire will need to find a way to reassure both the headmistress and the children that she is still a capable and reliable individual, despite the unfortunate age regression. Gaining back trust will likely be a gradual process requiring patience, understanding, and a demonstration of consistent competence in her responsibilities. Moving forward, Sapphire may want to focus on tasks and activities that align better with her new age and physical capabilities while building rapport with the children and showing her maturity by recognizing and navigating these new limitations."},{"prompt":"Drone Electronics","completion":"Drone electronics comprise various components that work together to ensure the drone functions as intended, ranging from flight control and stabilization to navigation and communication. Here is an overview of the main electronic components you might find in a typical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone: 1. **Flight Controller (FC):** This is the brain of the drone, featuring sensors (like gyroscopes and accelerometers) that help stabilize the drone during flight by making rapid adjustments to the motor speeds. The flight controller also interprets input from the pilot or an autopilot system to manage the craft's behavior. 2. **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC):** Each motor on a drone is connected to an ESC, which controls the speed at which the motor spins. The flight controller sends signals to the ESCs to adjust the speed of each motor to maintain balance, control speed, and manage direction. 3. **Motors and Propellers:** These are the mechanical parts that drive the drone. The motors spin the propellers, which generate lift. Brushless DC motors are commonly used because they are efficient, reliable, and have a long lifespan. 4. **Battery:** Typically, drones use Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries, as they have a high power-to-weight ratio, essential for maximizing flight time. These batteries require careful handling and charging to maintain safety and efficiency. 5. **Global Positioning System (GPS) Module:** Many drones come equipped with GPS to allow for automatic navigation, return-to-home functionalities, and other features like waypoint navigation. 6. **Communication System:** Drones use various communication systems for control and telemetry: - **Radio Transmitter and Receiver:** For manually piloted drones, a radio transmitter is used by the pilot, and a corresponding receiver is installed in the drone. - **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth:** Some consumer drones can be controlled via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth through a smartphone or tablet. - **Long-Range Communication Systems:** Advanced or long-distance drones may use specialized radio equipment for greater range. 7. **Sensors:** In addition to gyroscopes and accelerometers, drones often include other sensors such as magnetometers (compasses), barometers (to measure altitude), and even LiDAR, sonar, or optical flow sensors for more advanced positioning and collision avoidance capabilities. 8. **Camera and Gimbal:** Drones intended for aerial photography will include a camera, which is often mounted on a gimbal to stabilize the footage and allow for the camera's angle to be remotely controlled. 9. **Onboard Computers and Processing Units:** Advanced drones, like those used for commercial, scientific, or military purposes, might include more powerful onboard computers capable of image processing, obstacle detection and avoidance, and executing complex autonomous flight plans. 10. **Antenna:** Antennas are vital for maintaining communication between the drone and the controller or for receiving GPS signals. Their design is important for the range and quality of the signal. 11. **Power Distribution Board (PDB):** In multirotor drones, the PDB simplifies the wiring, distributing power from the battery to the ESCs and other components like flight controllers and FPV systems. 12. **First-Person View (FPV) System:** For drones used in racing or immersive piloting experiences, an FPV system includes a small camera and video transmitter on the drone, with the pilot wearing a headset or watching a screen to see what the drone sees in real time. 13. **Lighting:** Some drones are equipped with LED lights for visibility, to indicate status, or to help with orientation during flight, especially in low-light conditions. The integration and complexity of the electronics depend on the drone's purpose, be it a consumer, commercial, or military UAV. Consumer drones are typically more plug-and-play, whereas hobbyists and professionals might build custom setups that require a deep understanding of electronics, soldering, and system integration."},{"prompt":"Where can I learn about the architecture of drones electronics ?","completion":"Learning about drone electronics architecture can be approached from various sources, ranging from online platforms, academic courses, books, and hands-on experimentation.

They are not official Disney canon and have been created solely for entertainment purposes.** 1. **Judy Hopps** - *Secretest Secret:* She is utterly obsessed with carrot-flavored toothpaste to the point where she has a private stash. She keeps it a secret because she doesn't want to reinforce the stereotype that all rabbits are obsessed with carrots – she's a modern bunny breaking boundaries, after all! 2. **Nick Wilde** - *Secretest Secret:* Nick actually has a phobia of blueberries. Why keep it a secret? Because it would ruin his smooth-talking, cool-guy image if anyone knew he panicked every time he saw a tiny fruit that reminded him of... well, he doesn't really know why. 3. **Chief Bogo** - *Secretest Secret:* Despite his tough exterior, Bogo has a secret collection of Gazelle merchandise, including a limited-edition bedspread.

It is named after John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, an 18th-century English aristocrat. It is said that he ordered his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread so that he could eat without interrupting his gambling sessions or soiling his fingers. Because Montagu was the Earl of Sandwich, others began to order “the same as Sandwich,” which eventually just became \\"sandwich.\\" The term \\"sandwich\\" first entered the written English language in Edward Gibbon's journal, in longhand, referring to \\"bits of cold meat\\" as a 'Sandwich'. The first written usage of the English word appeared in Edward Gibbon's journal, in longhand, referring to \\"bits of cold meat\\" as a 'Sandwich'. It is said that Lord Sandwich was fond of this form of food because it allowed him to continue playing cards, particularly cribbage, while eating without using a fork and not getting his cards greasy from eating meat with his bare hands. The name of the Earl's title, Sandwich, is derived from a place name, meaning 'place on the sand' (Old English sand + wīc 'dwelling, place, town'). So, the word \\"sandwich\\" as we use it today links back to a particular person and place, with the concept of meat between bread taking on the name of the title held by the man credited with popularizing this form of food."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: My Dearest , That's why you need to contact my husband's lawyer, So that he will explain to you and also guide you in all legal matters.

The origins of Jersey Mike's trace back to 1956 when a small shop called \\"Mike's Submarines\\" was opened in the seaside town of Point Pleasant, New Jersey. The founder, Peter Cancro, started working in the submarine sandwich business when he was 14 years old. He was a high school student when he began working at the original Mike's Subs. In 1972, at the age of 17, Cancro bought the shop with money he borrowed from his football coach at the time, Rod Smith. Although still in high school, Cancro took a risk and became the owner of the business. Under his leadership, the store began gaining popularity for its fresh ingredients and distinctive preparation with meats and cheeses sliced to order directly in front of the customers. In 1987, Cancro started franchising the concept under the name \\"Jersey Mike's Subs\\" with the aim to expand its presence beyond its original location. The brand's emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients, customer service, and community involvement helped it grow significantly. Jersey Mike's distinguishes itself from other sub shops with its East Coast style subs, which are typically characterized by the use of vinegar and oil and the absence of toasted rolls and warm meat that many other sub shops provide. As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2023, Jersey Mike's has grown to over 2,000 locations across the United States, becoming one of the fastest-growing sandwich chains in the country."},{"prompt":"do you know the 90s TV game show \\"fun house\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"Fun House\\" was a popular children's television game show that aired in various versions and countries throughout the late '80s and into the '90s. The most well-known version in the United States, hosted by J.D. Roth, aired from 1988 to 1991, featuring teams of children competing in action-packed games and challenges for prizes. The format usually involved physical challenges, obstacle courses, and a final fun house run where contestants would grab tags representing prizes while navigating through an exciting maze filled with obstacles, ball pits, and slide. Each episode featured two teams, typically color-coded red and blue, competing against one another. A British version of \\"Fun House\\" was also incredibly popular, hosted by Pat Sharp along with the Fun House twins, Melanie and Martina Grant. It aired from 1989 to 1999 and was a staple for many British children growing up during that time. It followed a similar format to the American show, with teams competing in games, collecting points, and attempting to win prizes by racing through the fun house at the end of the show."},{"prompt":"please write a fun story about two friends sarah and emma appearing together as a team on fun house. they are playing against pam and gwen. sarah and emma absolutely love getting messy and dirty. the first game is not very messy and sarah and emma demand more mess. the host is happy to comply, as the show is supposed to be messy. pam and gwen are a bit prissy, unlike sarah and emma.","completion":"Once upon a time in the buzzing atmosphere of the iconic TV studio, two best friends named Sarah and Emma, both wearing bright yellow t-shirts and matching headbands, were bouncing with anticipation. Today was no ordinary day—for they had been selected to compete on their favorite game show, \\"Fun House\\"! As the studio lights shone down and the upbeat theme song filled the air, the charismatic host, equipped with a microphone and a mischievous grin, introduced the competitors. \\"On the yellow team, we have the dynamic duo, Sarah and Emma! And on the green team, let's welcome the meticulous pair, Pam and Gwen!\\" The crowd roared with applause as the energy in the room hit a fever pitch. The first game was unveiled—a crazy foam-less relay race around a tricky track filled with hoops and hurdles. Sarah and Emma, already covered in glitter from head to toe just for the occasion, exchanged looks of playful disappointment. \\"This is 'Fun House'!\\" shouted Sarah, her voice full of glee, \\"We came here to get messy!\\" Emma chimed in, \\"We were hoping for a gooey, oozy, sludgy kind of challenge!\\" Their infectious enthusiasm and love for mess caught on, and the crowd began chanting, \\"More mess! More mess!\\" The host laughed heartily, \\"Well, here at 'Fun House,' we aim to please!\\" With a wave of his hand, stagehands rushed in, rigging up slime hoses and buckets of sloppy goo above the track. \\"Is this messy enough for you?\\" he asked with a wink. Sarah and Emma whooped with joy, as the anticipation for the impending chaos grew. Pam and Gwen, however, exchanged nervous glances, their green outfits pristine and their hair perfectly coiffed—they were not thrilled at the prospect of an impending muck-ocalypse. Without further ado, the game began, and as Sarah and Emma charged through the course, they were showered in cascades of colorful goop while they laughed uproariously. Pam and Gwen gingerly made their way steadfastly, attempting to dodge the downpour of gunk, but the \\"Fun House\\" had other plans. Gooey globs dripped from their once-neat hair, causing shrieks and gasps from the audience. The messy mayhem continued as the games escalated in hilarity and pandemonium. But as the contest went on, Pam and Gwen started loosening up. The fun of frolicking in the filth eventually won them over, and they began laughing along, their aversion to the slop slipping away with each slide and splat. Finally, it was time for the \\"Fun House\\" grand finale; Sarah and Emma, now resembling abstract art masterpieces, were ready to dash through the maze. Amidst the whirlwind of obstacles, they snatched prize tags as they went, plunging down slides into ball pits and emerging from secret tunnels like victorious explorers. Pam and Gwen, now fully embracing the spirit of \\"Fun House,\\" chased after them, collecting their own share of tags amid the cheers of their newfound fans. As the siren sounded to signal the end of the game, all four girls emerged, splattered from head to toe, panting and laughing, clutching their prize tags tightly. They all shared high-fives and hugs, their early hesitations forgotten, united in the joy of the game and the unparalleled fun of getting absolutely, utterly, and delightfully messy. And so, in the heart of \\"Fun House,\\" amidst the laughter and squelches of muck, true friendship—and a love for mess—prevailed as Sarah and Emma's day of wild and gooey adventure came to an end. They didn't just leave with prizes, but with memories that would stick (quite literally) with them forever."},{"prompt":"please describe the second third and fourth games the teams played in detail. the games get increasingly messy.","completion":"**Game Two: The Pie Podium Pandemonium** After a quick cleanup from the first round, Sarah, Emma, Pam, and Gwen lined up for their next chaotic challenge—The Pie Podium Pandemonium. Four towering podiums stood before them, each rigged with a pie-launching contraption aiming right at the players’ faces. The goal was simple: answer trivia questions correctly to avoid a pie to the face, but get it wrong and...SPLAT! As the game progressed, Sarah's and Emma's eagerness for a sticky situation could hardly be contained. They reveled in the tension before each question, almost hoping for a miss to experience the messy glory of whipped cream and crust. Pam and Gwen, initially trying their best to remain spotless, couldn't help but chuckle when a wrong answer launched a pie that left Gwen looking like a dessert special. Rounds of questions continued, along with laughter echoed by the audience—each incorrect guess met with more outrageous pies until all four contestants looked like they had stumbled into a bakery battle zone, with giggles and cream everywhere. **Game Three: Slime Slipway Showdown** Cleaned up once more but still buzzing from the previous game, it was time for the Slime Slipway Showdown. This time, the task involved a relay race with a twist—or should we say, a slip. Each team member had to slide down a slick, slime-filled slipway, grab a flag at the bottom, and slide back up to tag their teammate. The slipway was a slippery, oozing mess of green gook, guaranteeing an equalizer in the match where only slip-and-slide techniques would serve as an asset. Sarah and Emma cannonballed into the slime, laughing uncontrollably as they skidded and clambered their way up and down the gooey gradient, flags in hand. Pam, trying to maintain her composure, slid down with grace but learned quickly that elegance matters little in a sea of slime. She emerged drenched, her previous prissiness replaced by uncontrollable, slime-induced giggles as she handed the flag to Gwen, who was already stifling laughter. **Game Four: The Splatter Ladder Challenge** The final challenge before the ultimate \\"Fun House\\" run was the Splatter Ladder Challenge. This game pushed the limits of messiness, featuring a massive ladder stretching over a pool filled with a rainbow array of paint and an array of sprinklers ready to spritz the climbing contestants with colorful goo. The objective was to climb up while avoiding spinning obstacles, retrieving balloons filled with mystery substances at various rungs. Upon descent, the balloons had to be sat on in a designated squish zone, unleashing their contents upon the respective contestant. Sarah and Emma climbed bravely, facing runny yolk, slippery marinara sauce, and vibrant paint as the obstacles spun and the sprinklers sprayed. Each successful balloon retrieval ended in an explosion of color and laughter. Pam and Gwen approached the Splatter Ladder with determination, surprising themselves with how eagerly they threw caution—and cleanliness—to the wind. When Gwen's balloon popped, releasing a torrent of sparkly glitter, her expression transformed from shock to pure, unabashed joy. The audience roared in approval, the host cheered them on, and the studio became a canvas of chromatic chaos. All four girls, now living masterpieces of the games thus far, were exhilarated, awash with anticipation for the grand finale, the fabled \\"Fun House\\" run where the ultimate prizes—and yes, even more mess—awaited them."},{"prompt":"please write about sarah and emma getting to go into the fun house. it is very messy, much more so than it really was on the show.","completion":"After conquering the Splatter Ladder Challenge with flying colors—quite literally—Sarah and Emma were beaming from ear to ear. Covered head to toe in a cocktail of slippery yolk, marinara sauce, twinkling glitter, and vibrant paint, they were ready for their final, and most anticipated, moment of glory: the Fun House run. The host, his voice booming with excitement, gave the signal. \\"On your mark, get set, GO!\\" The theme music pumped up the volume as Sarah and Emma dove into the legendary Fun House, grinning like never before. The Fun House itself was an awe-inspiring labyrinth, a child's wild dream with a twist of total mayhem. The path before them was decked out with more pitfalls and surprises than ever before, a true paradise for two friends who loved nothing more than to get gloriously messy. Their first obstacle was the Tank of Tapioca. This wasn’t just a knee-high splash through colored water. No, Sarah and Emma waded into a tub of thick, gooey tapioca pudding, giggling as they sloshed through, searching for the hidden prize tag amongst the gobs of globby mush. Further ahead, they encountered the Confetti Cyclone—a wind tunnel exploding with a blizzard of paper confetti. The colorful pieces stuck to their saucy, sticky bodies, turning them into walking kaleidoscopes as they high-fived and grabbed another tag hanging from the ceiling. With little time to spare, they darted through a corridor lined with Bumper Balloons, each one filled with a mystery mess instead of air. Bursting through, they were showered in bursts of flour, clouds of powdered sugar, and a rain of rainbow sprinkles, each step forward prompting another delightful explosion. Their laughter echoed as they rushed to the next challenge, feeling like the stars of their own slapstick comedy. The Honeycomb Maze was next, a section riddled with walls of stretchy, sticky honeycomb. They pushed through, battling the clingy tendrils with determination while snatching yet another pair of prize tags. Each step left them more entangled but also more joyful—after all, the mess was the best part! Emerging from the maze, they slid down the Slime Slide, a slippery descent into a pool of neon green goo that would make a mutant turtle proud. They splashed down, momentarily submerged in the slime before resurfacing, hands aloft with another prize tag. Their finale was the Mountain of Mousse—a massive climb up a slope of chocolate mousse, frothy and fragrant. It was a dessert disaster waiting to happen, and as they climbed, they left a trail of chocolate footprints. With one final heave, they reached the summit, grasped the last prize tag, and slid victoriously down the other side, into a pit of soft, squishy marshmallows. Time was up! Sarah and Emma emerged from the Fun House breathless, triumphant, and looking like a pair of abstract masterpieces. The audience cheered wildly, the host applauded, and the girls looked at each other—one big, beautiful, hilarious mess—and could only laugh. They had not only conquered the Fun House, but they had turned it into an unforgettable splatter-fest, and in doing so, they had created the messiest, most memorable experience of their lives."},{"prompt":"what did sarah and emma look like at the end of the show?","completion":"By the end of the show, Sarah and Emma were barely recognizable beneath layers of whimsical wreckage from the Fun House. Their bright yellow team shirts were now a patchwork of stains, splatters, and smudges from the array of colorful obstacles they had encountered. Their hair, once neatly tied back for the competition, now stuck out in wild directions, stiff with tapioca pudding and streaked with the rainbow remnants of the Confetti Cyclone. Faces flushed with excitement and laughter, each had smears of chocolate mousse across their cheeks and foreheads, with the occasional marshmallow still clinging on for dear life. The once matching headbands were now completely obscured by a vibrant mix of flour, powdered sugar, and all the other elements they had joyously burst through during the Bumper Balloon corridor. Goo from the slime slide gave their skin a glistening sheen, catching the studio lights as they shone down on the victorious duo. Their hands and arms, which had delved into tanks, grabbed at prize tags, and scaled the sticky Honeycomb Maze, were a living art exhibit of the intense fun and chaos they had thrown themselves into so wholeheartedly. Even their sneakers had transformed. No longer just footwear, they were now odd souvenirs from a mountainous climb of chocolate mousse and a trek through a marshmallow pit. As they stood there, panting, beaming from ear to ear, and covered from head to toe in the joyful debris of the Fun House, Sarah and Emma embodied the very essence of the show – unabashed fun, a spirit for adventure, and a love for getting spectacularly messy."},{"prompt":"Dragon Ball : Como Seria A Combinação Do Instinto Superior Com A Técnica De Teletransporte","completion":"A combinação do Instinto Superior, uma das formas mais avançadas de poder da série \\"Dragon Ball\\", com a técnica de Teletransporte, conhecida em japonês como \\"Shunkan Ido\\" e em inglês como \\"Instant Transmission\\", seria uma mistura extremamente poderosa e quase invencível em combate. O Instinto Superior é um estado que permite ao usuário evitar instintivamente qualquer ataque, sem a necessidade de pensar nas ações. É uma forma que foi primeiramente dominada por Goku durante o arco do Torneio do Poder em \\"Dragon Ball Super\\". Este estado não apenas aumenta drasticamente a velocidade e a força do usuário, mas também a sua capacidade de reação, permitindo que ele se mova e contra-ataque sem processar conscientemente a ação. A técnica de Teletransporte, por outro lado, permite ao usuário se mover instantaneamente para qualquer local que possa visualizar claramente em sua mente, desde que conheça a assinatura de energia do local ou de uma pessoa próxima ao destino pretendido. Essa habilidade é usada muitas vezes por Goku e outros personagens ao longo da série para viagens rápidas ou para escapar de situações perigosas. Ao combinar as duas técnicas, o usuário teria a habilidade de se deslocar para qualquer local instantaneamente, ao mesmo tempo em que esquivaria de ataques sem esforço. Em teoria, a combinação faria com que Goku ou outro lutador com estas habilidades fosse capaz de: 1. Antecipar e reagir a quaisquer movimentos do adversário automaticamente, graças ao Instinto Superior. 2. Usar o Teletransporte para aumentar a imprevisibilidade dos seus movimentos, tornando-se quase impossível de rastrear ou atacar. 3. Contra-atacar de ângulos surpreendentes e em momentos inesperados, potencialmente pegando os oponentes totalmente desprevenidos. 4. Evitar ataques de área em larga escala, teletransportando-se para fora da zona de perigo instantaneamente. No entanto, é importante notar que, apesar dessa combinação ser extremamente poderosa, em \\"Dragon Ball\\" sempre existe a possibilidade de haver adversários com habilidades próprias que podem contrariar ou até mesmo superar essa combinação de técnicas. A série é conhecida por ter um constante aumento de níveis de poder com vilões que trazem novas e surpreendentes habilidades para a mesa."},{"prompt":"What temperature does ammonia become wet?","completion":"The term \\"wet\\" in relation to ammonia generally refers to a mixture of ammonia with water, creating an aqueous solution. Pure anhydrous ammonia is a gas at standard temperature and pressure, but it has a high affinity for water and can easily dissolve in it, resulting in what might be termed \\"wet\\" ammonia. Ammonia has a boiling point of -33.34°C (-28.012°F) at atmospheric pressure, which means it would be a gas above that temperature under normal conditions. At temperatures below its boiling point, ammonia condenses to become a liquid. When ammonia is in its liquid state and then mixed with water, it will form an aqueous ammonia solution. The concentration of ammonia in water can vary, and the term \\"aqueous ammonia\\" typically denotes solutions that contain between 5% and 10% ammonia by weight, though solutions can be substantially more diluted or concentrated depending on the application. If you are asking about the temperature at which ammonia can dissolve in water to form a solution (become \\"wet\\"), this can occur at a wide range of temperatures, as ammonia has a high solubility in water at room temperature. Near room temperature, water can dissolve an amount of ammonia gas in excess of 500 times its own volume. To get specific behavior such as whether ammonia becomes a saturated solution or forms a certain type of wet mixture, the temperature, pressure, and exact concentrations must be specified, and phase diagrams or solubility charts can provide that information."},{"prompt":"What type of liquid would silicon creatures drink?","completion":"The concept of silicon-based life forms is purely speculative and hypothetical, since all known life on Earth is carbon-based. Carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form stable, complex molecules that are essential for life's processes, whereas silicon, despite being in the same group of the periodic table, does not form as diverse a range of compounds at Earth-like temperatures. However, in the realm of science fiction and speculative biology, theorists imagine silicon-based life might evolve on a planet with very different environmental conditions than Earth's. If we dare to speculate about the type of liquid such creatures might 'drink,' it would likely need to be a solvent that can dissolve silicon-based compounds in a way analogous to how water dissolves carbon-based compounds for Earth life. In such a speculative scenario, potential liquids for silicon-based life might include: 1. **Silicones (Organosilicon Compounds):** These are compounds that contain silicon-to-oxygen and silicon-to-carbon bonds. Silicones are known for their stability and could hypothetically function as solvents for silicon-based life forms. 2. **Liquid Metals:** If the environment were very hot, something like liquid silicon or a silicon-metal eutectic mixture might be necessary. This would require temperatures far above those found on Earth's surface. 3. **Liquid Sulfur Compounds:** Silicon sulfides are analogous to carbon dioxide in some ways, so it's possible that sulfur compounds could play a role in a silicon creature's biochemistry, perhaps in high-temperature environments. 4. **Halogenated Solvents:** In a colder environment, perhaps substances that remain liquid at low temperatures, like silicon tetrachloride, could act as solvents. Any biological functions that require a solvent in silicon-based life would need a fluid that remains liquid across the organism's operational temperature range and is able to dissolve substances for chemical reactions to occur within their bodies. It's important to note that these suggestions are entirely speculative, and there is no empirical evidence supporting the existence of silicon-based life or their biological processes. The science surrounding the possibility of such life forms is limited by our understanding of chemistry as it pertains to known biological systems, which are all based on complex carbon chemistry. Thus, while it is an interesting thought experiment, it is currently beyond the realm of practical science."},{"prompt":"Let’s do a roleplay scenario set in a fantasy world before technology where I control Sapphire, a 17 year old girl who returns to the orphanage where she grew up to help the headmistress to take care of the kids there. There’s one particular problematic 3 year old girl called Lily who unknowingly has the mysterious power to regress the age of others and make her grow up faster, as just a month ago she was just 1 year old, but she absorbed the age from some of the toddler orphans and they regressed back into babies, forgot words and have to be in diapers again. Can Sapphire manage to watch over Lily, keep her away from regressing the other kids, and avoid regressing herself? and if not, just how young will she get? We’ll use d20 rolls to determine whether Sapphire manages to resist Lily’s powers, and if she can’t, by how much she regresses and by how much Lily grows in return. The more she regresses, the more difficult it’d be for her to control Lily and be respected by the other orphans at the orphanage (kids there are up to age 12) and be reliable in the eyes of the headmistress. If Lily grows up to the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers, which gives her a bonus to them, and will seek to regress Sapphire intentionally so she herself can grow up and become a teenager. Tell me when to roll and I’ll tell you the result of my rolls. Regressing will give Sapphire penalties to her future rolls. Have a “system of trust” that concerns how various parties at the orphanage deem Sapphire and how reliable and capable she is, and depends on rolls and actions, Sapphire can increase or decrease her worth in the eyes of said parties. The parties are: Lily; the headmistress; the younger orphanage kids; the older orphanage kids. Low and high trust will give her penalties and bonuses in specific rolls.","completion":"In this fantasy, roleplay scenario, Sapphire's primary task is to care for Lily and prevent her from causing further accidental age regression among the children at the orphanage. Her secondary tasks include maintaining her reputation and trustworthiness with the various parties at the orphanage. We'll structure the scenario with the following mechanics: **Lily's Power Check**: Whenever Lily is in a situation where she could potentially regress someone's age (usually due to strong emotions like anger, fear, or excitement), you'll roll a d20 for Sapphire to see if she can manage the situation. - On a roll of 15-20, Sapphire successfully calms or distracts Lily, preventing any regression. - On a roll of 10-14, Lily partially regresses someone's age, but Sapphire mitigates the effect. - On a roll of 1-9, Lily fully regresses someone, and Sapphire herself is at risk. **Regression Effect**: If Sapphire fails to manage the situation, roll a d20 to determine the extent of regression: - On a roll of 1-5, Sapphire regresses a significant amount (subtract 2-4 years from her age). - On a roll of 6-10, Sapphire regresses moderately (subtract 1-2 years). - On a roll of 11-15, Sapphire regresses slightly (subtract a few months to 1 year). - On a roll of 16-20, Sapphire avoids regression, but someone else is affected (you decide who). **Trust System**: Sapphire's actions affect her trust levels with the different parties. Positive actions towards a group earn trust, while negative actions or failure to manage Lily's powers could decrease it. Trust affects Sapphire's effectiveness: - High Trust: +2 bonus on power checks and regression rolls. - Low Trust: -2 penalty on power checks and regression rolls. **Awareness Trigger for Lily**: If Lily reaches the age of 8, she becomes aware of her powers. Sapphire’s goal is to prevent this before she understands how to control Lily. **Starting Trust Levels**: - Lily: Neutral (no initial bonus or penalty) - Headmistress: High Trust (+2 bonus) due to history - Younger orphans: High Trust (+2 bonus) due to Sapphire's caring nature - Older orphans: Neutral (no initial bonus or penalty) Sapphire's current age is 17. Let's begin the roleplay scenario with Sapphire entering the orphanage. She greets the headmistress warmly and is informed about the situation with Lily and the importance of monitoring her closely. Now, Sapphire plans to first engage with Lily to build a rapport and watch her closely. **First action**: Sapphire attempts to build a connection with Lily to make it easier to manage her emotions. Roll a d20 for a Trust Check with Lily to see if Sapphire's initial efforts are successful."},{"prompt":"6","completion":"With a roll of 6, Sapphire's initial efforts to bond with Lily are somewhat clumsy. Lily is a complex child, with a combination of both openness and wariness towards new caretakers, perhaps due to the fluctuations in her age and understanding. Hence, Sapphire's approach doesn’t resonate as well as she had hoped. Lily seems indecisive and slightly mistrustful, not yet ready to see Sapphire as a caregiver or playmate. Sapphire realizes that she'll need to take careful, gradual steps to earn Lily's trust. As a result, Sapphire's initial trust with Lily remains Neutral, but she now knows she must tread carefully as she attempts to prevent any regression incidents. Next, Sapphire decides to spend more time with Lily to better manage her and reduce the likelihood of an accidental age regression. **Age Regression Check**: As part of this careful attention, Sapphire notices Lily becoming agitated as the other kids are making noise, a situation that might trigger her powers. Roll a d20 to see if Sapphire manages to calm Lily down before an incident occurs."},{"prompt":"10","completion":"With a roll of 10, Sapphire's effort to calm down an agitated Lily is partially successful. She's able to soothe Lily enough to prevent a full-blown outburst, but not entirely prevent her powers from activating. **Partial Regression Effect**: Lily's powers leak out in a minor wave as her emotions run high. Sapphire can feel the magic in the air, and while she manages to protect most of the kids, one or two may have regressed slightly. Roll a d20 to determine the extent of the regression. If the roll is on the higher side, perhaps Sapphire only aged down a month or two. If it's lower, she might have regressed by a year or so, but due to her partial success, she herself should be safe from regressing significantly."},{"prompt":"2","completion":"With a roll of 2, the regression effect is more pronounced than Sapphire would have hoped, despite her partial success in calming Lily. One of the younger children nearby, who was playing noisily, suddenly finds himself stumbling as his body shrinks slightly. The child, previously a talkative four-year-old, is now struggling with simple sentences, indicating that he's regressed by about a year. This regression happens amidst gasps from the other children, who are now acutely aware of Lily's impact, although they might not fully comprehend the situation. For Sapphire, the roll means the event doesn't hit her personally with severe regression; she only feels a slight drain and moments of dizziness, suggesting a minor temporal displacement for herself. Still, the incident requires her immediate damage control both regarding the children's well-being and the trust of those around her. Now, the trust levels may shift slightly. The younger orphans, who might have seen one of their own regress, could lose some confidence in Sapphire's ability to protect them from Lily's powers, possibly imposing a small trust penalty. The headmistress may also hear of this and might start to worry about Sapphire's ability to handle the situation, although the history and high initial trust might cushion the impact of this single incident. **Trust Adjustment**: You will need to take actionable steps to restore the trust of the younger orphans and possibly the headmistress. Additionally, continuing to try and bond with Lily is essential to prevent further incidents. Sapphire decides to address the immediate situation by comforting the regressed child and explaining the situation to the headmistress. Roll a d20 for a Trust Check with the younger orphans to see if Sapphire manages to reassure them after this unsettling event."},{"prompt":"8","completion":"With a roll of 8, Sapphire struggles to fully reassure the younger orphans. The recent regression event has shaken their confidence in her ability to keep the environment safe and consistent. While some of the children respond to her comforting presence, others remain uneasy and look towards the older children or the headmistress for stability. The partial success means that while Sapphire doesn't lose all the trust she had built up, she does suffer a minor setback. The younger kids might still approach her, but they display a cautious hesitance during interactions, especially around Lily. Next, it's time to communicate with the headmistress about what happened. The headmistress's higher initial trust level offers a cushion against the setback, but careful handling of this discussion could maintain that trust or even improve it if Sapphire can display a clear plan of action. Roll a d20 for a Trust Check with the headmistress to gauge her response to Sapphire's handling of the situation and to outline her plans to prevent further issues."},{"prompt":"Translate \\"Some other things\\" to Spanish.","completion":"\\"Some other things\\" in Spanish can be translated as \\"Algunas otras cosas\\"."},{"prompt":"Shingeki no kyojin:O Que Marley Faria Com O Poder Do Titã Fundador?","completion":"Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (também conhecido como \\"Attack on Titan\\"), Marley é uma das nações mais poderosas e tem um interesse estratégico nos poderes dos Titãs, particularmente no Poder do Titã Fundador, que é o mais poderoso de todos. O Poder do Titã Fundador é detido inicialmente pela família real de Paradis, os Reiss (ou Fritz, dependendo do ponto na história), e é capaz de controlar todos os outros Titãs, além de manipular a memória dos sujeitos de Ymir, tornando-o uma arma de imenso poder e potencial. Caso Marley conseguisse obter o Poder do Titã Fundador, é provável que ele seria usado para: 1. **Dominação Militar**: Reforçar seu domínio militar sobre outras nações e consolidar seu poder, já que seria capaz de controlar enormes contingentes de Titãs Puros para usar como armas de guerra. 2. **Controle dos Eldianos**: Utilizar o poder de alteração de memória para manipular e controlar a população Eldiana, possivelmente até mesmo para reescrever a história e fortalecer a propaganda anti-Eldiana que Marley promove em seu território. 3. **Estabilização Política**: Assegurar a estabilidade interna de Marley, pois o Poder do Titã Fundador é visto como uma ferramenta-chave para manter a ordem e a supremacia de Marley sobre outros grupos étnicos e nações. 4. **Expansão Territorial**: Prosseguir com a expansão territorial de Marley conquistando pelo medo ou força outras nações, utilizando a ameaça ou a demonstração do poder dos Titãs. 5. **Pesquisa Científica e Militar**: Avançar em investigações sobre os Titãs e talvez tentar desenvolver novas formas de armamento ou estratégias militares baseadas no poder dos Titãs. 6. **Solução para a Dependência de Titãs**: Em um estágio avançado da história, é mencionado que Marley começa a ter uma dependência decrescente na força dos Titãs, devido ao avanço da tecnologia anti-Titã. Por isso, controlar o Titã Fundador poderia ser um modo de reafirmar a posição de Marley como superpotência, até eles se adaptarem às novas realidades de guerra. Marley já possuía vários dos outros Titãs Herdados e usava-os ativamente para propósitos militares e para manter sua hegemonia. A aquisição do Poder do Titã Fundador significaria um aumento imenso em seu poder e influência, solidificando ainda mais a sua posição como uma potência dominante no mundo de \\"Attack on Titan\\". Porém, os métodos que utilizariam para tal fim certamente envolveriam mais conflitos e o uso continuado da guerra como uma alavanca de poder."},{"prompt":"Como Marley Utilizaria Tal Poder Sem O Sangue Real?","completion":"Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (Attack on Titan), a capacidade de usar plenamente o Poder do Titã Fundador é restrita aos indivíduos da linhagem real dos Fritz/Reiss. Aqueles sem sangue real podem herdar o Titã Fundador, mas não podem acessar suas habilidades de controle sobre os outros Titãs ou manipulação de memória. Isso é um obstáculo significativo para Marley, que não tem acesso a um portador com sangue real. No entanto, se Marley conseguisse obter o Poder do Titã Fundador sem ter alguém de sangue real para usá-lo, eles poderiam tentar as seguintes estratégias: 1. **Captura de um Eriano de Sangue Real**: Buscar maneiras de forçar ou persuadir um Eldiano de sangue real a colaborar com eles, seja sob ameaça, manipulação ou algum tipo de trato. Um possível candidato seria a Princesa Historia Reiss (ou qualquer outro parente vivo desconhecido) que está dentro das muralhas de Paradis. 2. **Pesquisa e Experimentação**: Conduzir experimentos científicos, possivelmente até mesmo cruéis, em Titãs Herdados e Eldianos de sangue real na tentativa de replicar ou contornar a necessidade do sangue real para usar o Poder do Titã Fundador efetivamente. 3. **Uso Limitado**: Mesmo sem o acesso total às capacidades de controle e manipulação de memória, o possuidor do Titã Fundador ainda é um Titã de poder considerável; portanto, Marley poderia usá-lo em combate como uma arma formidável. 4. **Estudo da História dos Eldianos**: Investigar a história dos Eldianos e os mistérios por trás do Poder do Titã Fundador para buscar algum conhecimento perdido ou esquecido que pudesse ajudar a desbloquear ou contornar a necessidade do sangue real. 5. **Alianças Políticas**: Forjar alianças com indivíduos ou grupos que tenham acesso a alguém de sangue real para criar uma relação de necessidade mútua. A narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\" explora a complexidade moral de tais ações e o impacto que elas teriam tanto em indivíduos específicos quanto na sociedade em geral. A luta por poder entre Marley e as pessoas dentro das muralhas de Paradis é um tema central da série, e o controle do Titã Fundador desempenha um papel crucial nos eventos que se desenvolvem ao longo da história."},{"prompt":"Предложи список малоизвестных и забытых игп, похожих на For Honor.","completion":"For Honor — это уникальная игра, которая сочетает элементы файтинга, экшена, и стратегии, с акцентом на рукопашный бой средневековых воинов.
