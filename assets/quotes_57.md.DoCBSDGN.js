To find (a_0) such that there exists a number (A) with (a_n = A) for infinitely many (n), let us investigate the conditions and behaviors of the sequence. 4. Notice that if (a_{n+1} = sqrt{a_n}), then (a_n) is a perfect square. Since perfect squares modulo 3 are either 0 or 1, if (a_n) modulo 3 is 2, it cannot be a perfect square. 5.

Thus, the slope of our symmetrical line must also be 3, the same as the slope of y=3x+3. Now, we will find the point of intersection between the original line y=3x+3 and the line l. To do this, we set the equations equal to each other: 3x+3 = x-2. Solving the equation: 3x - x = -2 - 3, 2x = -5, x = -frac{5}{2}.

So, the point of intersection is left(-frac{5}{2}, -frac{9}{2}right). The symmetrical point with respect to the line l will have the same x-coordinate because l has a slope of 1, meaning that the x-distance will be equal. To find the y-coordinate of the symmetrical point, we calculate the y-distance between the original point and the line l and double it: d = left| frac{-frac{5}{2} - (-frac{9}{2}) - 2}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} right| = left| frac{frac{4}{2} - 2}{sqrt{2}} right| = left| frac{0}{sqrt{2}} right| = 0. The y-distance between the original point and the line l is 0, which means that the symmetrical point's y-coordinate is the same as the original point's y-coordinate because it lies on the line l itself. With this information, we can say that the symmetrical point is also left(-frac{5}{2}, -frac{9}{2}right), and the equation of the symmetrical line will have the same slope as the original line, which is 3, and it will pass through the point left(-frac{5}{2}, -frac{9}{2}right).

Given that the yellow square is centrally located and smaller, if we hypothesize that each yellow square in the quadrant is (0.05s times 0.05s = 0.0025s^2), then the total area for the yellow square is ( 0.01s^2 ). 4. **Calculate the percentage**: Since the area of the yellow square is ( 0.01s^2 ) and the total area is ( s^2 ), the percentage of the area that is yellow is (frac{0.01s^2}{s^2} times 100% = 1%).

This is because each line can separate at most two pairs of points, and we need to ensure that all pairs are separated. 2. **Establish the upper bound constructively:** - Assume without loss of generality that ( n = 2p ) is even (if ( n ) is odd, the argument can be adjusted similarly). - Arrange the points such that exactly ( p ) points lie above the ( x )-axis and exactly ( p ) points lie below the ( x )-axis. - Use the ( x )-axis as the first line. This line generates two regions, each containing ( p ) points. - In subsequent steps, pick two points ( A ) and ( B ) above the ( x )-axis that are not yet separated and two points ( C ) and ( D ) below the ( x )-axis that are not yet separated. - Choose a point ( P_1 ) on the segment (overline{AB}) and a point ( P_2 ) on the segment (overline{CD}), and introduce a line (ell) through ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ). Ensure that (ell) does not pass through any of the points ( A, B, C, D ). - Each new line subdivides one region with at least two points above the ( x )-axis and one region with at least two points below the ( x )-axis, resulting in four smaller regions, each containing at least one point. - Since each new line increases the number of regions containing at least one point by at least 2, the procedure terminates after ( p - 1 ) steps. 3. **Conclusion:** - Combining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the smallest positive integer ( m ) is (leftlceil frac{n}{2} rightrceil).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. **Grid Layout and Path Details**: - The grid is 2 times n which means it consists of 2n points. - Starting from the bottom-left corner, each efficient path will be 2n - 1 segments long. - The path must alternate between moving right and moving up in such a way that it covers all the points exactly once and does not intersect itself. 2. **Combinatorial Insight**: - Each move in the path can either be to the right or up. - For an efficient path from the bottom-left to the upper-right corner, we must move right (n-1) times and up (n-1) times. This is because moving right by n-1 steps and up by n-1 steps in any specific sequence will place us at the top-right corner. 3. **Choice of Steps**: - To form an efficient path, we need to choose (n-1) instances, where we will move up out of the total 2(n-1) moves. - This is fundamentally a problem of choosing which of the 2(n-1) moves are \\"up\\" moves (the remaining will automatically be \\"right\\" moves). 4. **Combinatorial Formula**: - The number of ways to choose (n-1) moves to be \\"up\\" from a total of 2(n-1) moves can be represented using binomial coefficients: binom{2(n-1)}{n-1} 5. **Particular Case for n = 2016**: - Substitute n = 2016 into the formula: binom{2(2016-1)}{2016-1} = binom{4030}{2015} Conclusion: The number of efficient paths in a 2 times 2016 grid is given by: boxed{binom{4030}{2015}}"},{"prompt":"an exam , gibi scored 59 percent , jigi scored 55 percent , mike scored 99 percent and lizzy 67 percent . the maximum score awarded in the exam is 700 . find the average mark scored by all the 4 students ?","completion":"To find the average mark scored by all 4 students, we first need to calculate the actual marks each student scored based on the percentage and then find the average of those marks.

This implies that any set of integers, including ( S = {lfloor npi rfloor mid n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ldots} ), contains arithmetic progressions of any finite length. 2. **No Infinite Arithmetic Progressions:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an infinite arithmetic progression in ( S ). Let this progression be ( a, a+d, a+2d, ldots ) for some integers ( a ) and ( d ). This means that for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), ( a + nd in S ). In other words, there exist integers ( k_n ) such that: [ a + nd = lfloor k_n pi rfloor ] for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 3. **Modulo (pi):** Let ( [m] ) denote ( m ) modulo (pi), i.e., ( [m] = m - lfloor m/pi rfloor pi ). Since (pi) is irrational, ( [d] > 0 ). For ( m in S ), we have ( [m] > pi - 1 ). 4. **Density Argument:** Since (pi) is irrational, the sequence ( {[a + nd]}_{n ge 0} ) is dense in the interval ((0, pi)). This follows from the fact that the sequence ( {a + nd mod pi} ) is an arithmetic progression with an irrational difference modulo (pi). 5. **Contradiction:** Because the sequence ( {[a + nd]}_{n ge 0} ) is dense in ((0, pi)), it cannot be that ( [a + nd] > pi - 1 ) for all ( n ). This would imply that not every element of the sequence ( {a + nd} ) can be in ( S ), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the set ( S ) cannot contain an infinite arithmetic progression.

First, note that the binomial coefficient ( binom{x}{k} ) is a polynomial in ( x ) of degree ( k ). 4. **Finite differences:** The ( k )-th finite difference of a polynomial ( P(x) ) is defined as: [ Delta^k P(x) = sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-i} binom{k}{i} P(x+i) ] For the polynomial ( f(x) ), since it is ( n )-degree and takes integer values at integer points ( x = 0, 1, ldots, n ), its finite differences at these points should be integers. 5. **Delta operator on binomial coefficients:** Consider ( Delta binom{x}{k} ): [ Delta binom{x}{k} = binom{x+1}{k} - binom{x}{k} ] By the properties of binomial coefficients, [ binom{x+1}{k} = binom{x}{k} + binom{x}{k-1} ] Thus: [ Delta binom{x}{k} = binom{x}{k-1} ] By induction, [ Delta^j binom{x}{k} = binom{x}{k-j} ] and ( Delta^k binom{x}{k} = 1 ) if ( j = k ). 6. **Form of ( d_k ):** Since the polynomial ( f(x) ) takes integer values at integer points, we can express ( f(x) ) as: [ f(x) = d_0 binom{x}{0} + d_1 binom{x}{1} + ldots + d_n binom{x}{n} ] where ( d_k = Delta^k f(0) ) by definition of finite differences. 7. **Conclusion:** Given that by the problem's condition these finite differences ( d_k ) are integers, the polynomial ( f(x) ) can indeed be written in the required binomial coefficient form.

According to the trillium theorem (a version of the mixtilinear incircle theorem), D is the circumcenter of triangle BIC. This means that D is equally distant from B, I, and C: [ DI = DB = DC. ] 4.

This implies cos C < 0, which means angle C must be obtuse. Now, we can rewrite sin B using the sum of angles identity: sin B = sin(A + C) = sin A cos C + cos A sin C. Since sin B = -sin A cos C, we have: sin A cos C + cos A sin C = -sin A cos C. So, it simplifies to: cos A sin C = -2sin A cos C. Therefore: tan C = -2tan A. Next, we express tan B using the tangent of the sum of angles: tan B = -tan(A + C) = -frac{tan A + tan C}{1 - tan A tan C} = -frac{-tan A}{1 + 2tan^2 A} = frac{1}{frac{1}{tan A} + 2tan A}.

The midpoint (F) of (CD) divides (CD) in half, therefore: [ |CF| = frac{1}{2} , text{cm} ] 8.

Finally, using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle (BFE), we can find the hypotenuse (|BE|): [ |BE| = sqrt{ left( frac{5}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 } = sqrt{ frac{25}{4} + frac{3}{4} } = sqrt{ frac{25 + 3}{4} } = sqrt{ frac{28}{4} } = sqrt{7} , text{cm} ] 10.

We will refer to this axis as the axis of symmetry of the regular n-solid angle. 1. **Start with Assumptions:** Consider a regular n-solid angle where all the plane angles and dihedral angles (angles between two plane faces) are congruent to each other. 2. **Plane Angles and Symmetry:** Given that all plane angles and dihedral angles are congruent, every edge belongs to a symmetry plane of two adjacent edges. This symmetry will map one adjacent edge to another, meaning the angles and the faces enclosing these edges have this symmetric property. 3. **Symmetry Transformation:** As a result of this congruence and symmetry of the dihedral angles, these angles and the enclosing faces will also be symmetric. Due to the congruence of these plane angles, moving through such transformations will keep transforming these adjacent sections into each other while preserving the congruence property. 4. **Global Symmetry:** Thus, the symmetry plane we considered initially ends up being a symmetry plane for the entire solid figure. However, not just this plane, but also every other plane that is symmetrical concerning this edge and its adjacent ones will possess this property. 5. **All Encompassing Symmetry:** By examining all symmetrical planes for the given solid angle, we can deduce that a combination of these symmetry transformations results in a rotational transformation about a line of their intersection. 6. **Finding the Angle of Rotation:** Precisely, the symmetry transformations when composed can be simplified as a rotation relative to a line where their corresponding planes intersect. For a regular n-solid angle, it is straightforward to determine that this rotational symmetry is exactly by angle frac{2pi}{n}. 7. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have established that there exists an axis about which, if we rotate by frac{2pi}{n}, the n-solid angle aligns perfectly with itself.

Therefore, A = {x | -2 leqslant x leqslant 3}. Next, we determine set B when a=1: - Substitute a=1 into the description of set B: 1-a < x leqslant 3a+1, - Simplifying gives: 0 < x leqslant 4. Therefore, B = {x | 0 < x leqslant 4} when a=1.

To determine whether there exist infinitely many triples ((p, q, r)) of positive integers with (p > q > r > 1) such that the product (p! cdot q! cdot r!) is a perfect square, we analyze the proposed solutions. # A: (James Xu) 1.1. Consider an arbitrary positive integer (t). 1.2. Let's formulate a perfect square using factorials: [ (t!)!^2 = (t!)! cdot (t!)! ] 1.3.

Since ((t!)!^2) is a perfect square, it follows that such triples ((p, q, r)) can be constructed for any positive integer (t). 1.6.

We can express ((6t^2)!) as follows: [ (6t^2)! = (6t^2 - 1)! times 6t ] 2.4. Therefore, the product becomes: [ p! cdot q! cdot r! = left( (6t^2 - 1)! times 6t right) times (6t^2 - 1)! times 3! ] 2.5. Arranging the terms properly: [ p! cdot q! cdot r! = left( (6t^2 - 1)! times 6t times 3 right)^2 ] 2.6. Which simplifies to: [ p! cdot q! cdot r! = left( (6t^2 - 1)! times 18t right)^2 ] 2.7.

Let the inversion center be ( O ) (the center of (omega)), and the inversion radius be the radius of (omega). 3. **Properties of Inversion:** - Under inversion, points on (omega) remain fixed. - The inversion of a line passing through the center of the circle (in this case, ( PK )) will be a line passing through the center itself. However, since ( angle IKP = 90^circ ), this tells us that point ( K ) will invert onto the point ( K' ) on the line ( EF ). - Specifically, ( K' ) is located such that it is the inversion image of ( K ). 4. **Locating ( Q ) Under Inversion:** - ( M ) and ( N ), which are the inversion images of ( K ) and ( I ) respectively, lie on the circle with diameter ( IP ) due to the right angle at ( K ). 5. **Center of Circumscribed Circle:** - Let ( S ) be the midpoint of ( PK ). - Consider that point ( Q ) under inversion will be mapped onto the circle which has a diameter ( IP ). - Point ( P ) inverts to itself since it lies on (omega). Thus, the image of ( Q ) (under inversion) still lies on the circle.

Bruce skips at 1 mile per hour. 2. Tony skips at twice the speed of Bruce, so Tony skips at 2 * 1 = 2 miles per hour. 3. Brandon can skip at a certain fraction of the speed that Tony can, but we don't know this fraction yet. 4. Colin can skip at six times the speed that Brandon can. We are given that Colin's speed is 4 miles per hour, and we need to find out if this information is consistent with the other given information. Since Colin can skip at six times the speed that Brandon can, let's denote Brandon's speed as B miles per hour. Therefore, Colin's speed would be 6B miles per hour. According to the information given, Colin's speed is 4 miles per hour, so we have: 6B = 4 To find Brandon's speed, we divide both sides by 6: B = 4 / 6 B = 2 / 3 So, Brandon can skip at 2/3 miles per hour. Now, we need to check if Brandon's speed is a certain fraction of Tony's speed (which is 2 miles per hour). Since Brandon's speed is 2/3 miles per hour, we can see that this is indeed a fraction of Tony's speed: 2/3 is 1/3 of 2.

Approximately how many students scored above 130?","completion":"Given the mathematical scores X follow a normal distribution N(110, 20^2), Let's first calculate the probability that a student scores above 130. To do this, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution curve and the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule). The empirical rule states that approximately: - 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation (sigma) of the mean (mu), - 95% lies within two standard deviations, - 99.7% lies within three standard deviations. Therefore, we have P(110 - 2 times 20 < X < 110 + 2 times 20) = P(70 < X < 150) = 0.954 and P(110 - 1 times 20 < X < 110 + 1 times 20) = P(90 < X < 130) = 0.683 Next, we calculate the probability for the score to be between 130 and 150. By symmetry of the normal distribution, the probability P(130 < X < 150) can be obtained by taking the half-difference between P(70 < X < 150) and P(90 < X < 130): P(130 < X < 150) = frac{1}{2} (P(70 < X < 150) - P(90 < X < 130)) Since P(70 < X < 150) = 0.954 and P(90 < X < 130) = 0.683: P(130 < X < 150) = frac{1}{2} (0.954 - 0.683) = frac{1}{2} times 0.271 = 0.1355 To find the approximate number of students who scored above 130, multiply this probability by the total number of students (56): Number of students scoring above 130 approx 56 times 0.1355 approx 7.588, which we round to 8.

What is the rate of the train for the third hour?","completion":"Let's denote the rate of the train for the third hour as ( x ) miles/hr. For the first hour, the train travels ( 10 ) miles (since the rate is ( 10 ) miles/hr). For the second hour, the train travels ( 20 ) miles (since the rate is ( 20 ) miles/hr). For the third hour, the train travels ( x ) miles (since the rate is ( x ) miles/hr). Starting from the fourth hour, the rate of the train increases by ( 10 ) miles/hr each hour. So, for the fourth hour, the rate will be ( x + 10 ) miles/hr, for the fifth hour ( x + 20 ) miles/hr, and so on, until the eleventh hour. The total distance covered in 11 hours is ( 660 ) miles.

Therefore, we can write the equation: [ 6C + 4K = 90 ] Since the problem does not provide any additional information that differentiates between the number of pieces in a box of chocolate candy and a box of caramel candy, we must assume that each box, regardless of the type of candy, contains the same number of pieces.

Since CD = CP + DP = 1 + 2 = 3, and OD = 2, we apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle OED to find OE: [ OE = sqrt{OD^2 - left(frac{CD}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2^2 - left(frac{3}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{7}{4}}. ] - Since EP = CD - DP = 3 - 2 = 1, and EP is bisected by OE (because ODP is isosceles and OE is perpendicular to DP), we have EP = frac{1}{2}. - Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle OEP, we find OP: [ OP = sqrt{OE^2 + left(frac{EP}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{7}{4} + frac{1^2}{2^2}} = sqrt{2}. ] 4. **Calculate the Ratio frac{AP}{BP}**: - Since O is the circumcenter, AO = BO = OD = 2. Therefore, we can express frac{AP}{BP} as frac{AO + OP}{BO - OP}, substituting the lengths we found: [ frac{AP}{BP} = frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{2 - sqrt{2}}. ] - Simplifying this expression using the conjugate, we get: [ frac{AP}{BP} = 3 + 2sqrt{2}. ] Therefore, the ratio frac{AP}{BP} can be expressed in the form p + qsqrt{r}, where p = 3, q = 2, and r = 2.

It covers an area of 35.2 m² (approximately) in 4 revolutions. (use π = 22/7) What is the diameter of the garden roller?","completion":"To find the diameter of the garden roller, we need to first calculate the area covered by the roller in one revolution and then use that to find the circumference of the roller. Since the circumference of a circle (or cylinder in this case) is directly related to its diameter, we can then find the diameter. The area covered in 4 revolutions is 35.2 m², so the area covered in one revolution is: Area per revolution = Total area / Number of revolutions Area per revolution = 35.2 m² / 4 Area per revolution = 8.8 m² The area covered in one revolution is the surface area of the cylinder that touches the ground, which is a rectangle when unrolled. The length of this rectangle is the same as the length of the roller, and the width is the circumference of the roller. So, the area covered in one revolution is also equal to the length of the roller multiplied by the circumference (C) of the roller: Area per revolution = Length of roller * Circumference of roller 8.8 m² = 2 m * C C = 8.8 m² / 2 m C = 4.4 m Now, we know that the circumference of a circle (or cylinder) is given by the formula: C = π * d Where C is the circumference and d is the diameter. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the diameter: d = C / π We are given π as 22/7, so we can substitute the values we have: d = 4.4 m / (22/7) d = 4.4 m * (7/22) d = (4.4 * 7) / 22 d = 30.8 / 22 d = 1.4 m Therefore, the diameter of the garden roller is boxed{1.4} meters."},{"prompt":"Three of the below entries, with labels a , b , c , are blatantly incorrect (in the United States).

For our function, y=-(x-1)^2+2, comparing it to the general form, we find that h=1. Therefore, the axis of symmetry is the line x=1. 2. **Determine the Direction of the Parabola**: The coefficient of the squared term, a, determines whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. If a>0, the parabola opens upwards, and if a<0, it opens downwards. In our case, a=-1, which is less than 0, indicating that the parabola opens downwards. 3. **Find the Maximum or Minimum Value**: Since the parabola opens downwards, it has a maximum value at its vertex. The vertex form of the quadratic function gives us the vertex (h,k) directly, which in this case is (1,2). Therefore, the maximum value of the function is y=2.

We start by identifying necessary and sufficient conditions: 1. If a rectangle has side lengths ( x ) and ( y ) (where ( x leq y )), it must satisfy two inequalities: ( xy > m ) and ( x(y-1) < m ). This ensures that while the area of the rectangle is greater than ( m ), any subrectangle derived from removing one column has an area less than ( m ). Next, we classify the rectangles under different cases based on the value of ( m ): 1. When ( m = k^2 ), with ( k geq 4 ): [ k geq 4 ] - Choose ( x = k - 1 ) and ( y = k + 2 ). Verification: [ x y = (k-1)(k+2) = k^2 + k - 2 ] which satisfies ( k^2 < k^2 + k - 2 ) for ( k geq 4 ). Also: [ x(y-1) = (k-1)(k+1) = k^2 - 1 ] Thus, ( x(y-1) < m = k^2 ). This ensures the area is greater than ( m ) and removing one row (or column) leaves an area less than ( m ). 2. When ( k^2 < m < k(k+1) ), with ( k geq 4 ): - Choose ( x = k ) and ( y = k + 1 ). Verification: [ x y = k(k+1) = k^2 + k ] which satisfies ( m < k^2 + k ) as required. Also: [ x(y-1) = k cdot k = k^2 ] Thus, ( x(y-1) = k^2 < m ). This setup ensures the area is slightly greater than ( k^2 ) but less than ( k(k+1) ). 3. When ( m = k(k+1) ), with ( k geq 4 ): - Choose ( x = k - 1 ) and ( y = k + 3 ). Verification: [ x y = (k-1)(k+3) = k^2 + 2k - 3 ] which satisfies ( k^2 + k < k^2 + 2k - 3 ). Also: [ x(y-1) = (k-1)(k+2) = k^2 + k - 2 ] Thus, ( x(y-1) < m = k(k+1) < k^2 + k ). Using this choice of ( x ) and ( y ), we ensure a configuration that meets the conditions. 4. When ( k(k+1) < m < (k+1)^2 ), with ( k geq 3 ): - Choose ( x = y = k + 1 ). Verification: [ x y = (k+1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 ] which satisfies ( m < k^2 + 2k + 1 ). Also: [ x(y-1) = (k+1) cdot k = k^2 + k ] Thus, ( x(y-1) < k^2 + 2k + 1 ).

First, let's calculate the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets in. Since the boat sinks by 1 cm (or 0.01 m), we can calculate the volume of water displaced as follows: Volume of water displaced (V) = length of the boat (L) × breadth of the boat (B) × change in depth (h) V = L × B × h We know the breadth (B) is 2 m and the change in depth (h) is 0.01 m.

What is the length of the train?","completion":"Let's denote the length of the train as ( L ) meters and the speed of the train as ( v ) meters per second. When the train crosses a signal pole, it only needs to cover its own length. The time it takes to cross the signal pole is given as 36 seconds. Therefore, we can write the following equation: [ L = v times 36 ] When the train crosses the platform, it needs to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. The time it takes to cross the platform is given as 39 seconds, and the length of the platform is given as 25 meters.

This assumption simplifies our calculations because we only need to consider relative distances. 2. **Defining Distances:** Suppose we have 45 points on the line, denoted as ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{45} ), all of which lie outside the segment ( AB ). Let's define the distances from each point ( P_i ) (where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 45 )) to the points ( A ) and ( B ) as follows: [ d(P_i, A) quad text{and} quad d(P_i, B) ] 3. **Distance Differences:** For each point ( P_i ), the difference between the distance from ( P_i ) to ( A ) and the distance from ( P_i ) to ( B ) is given by: [ left| d(P_i, A) - d(P_i, B) right| ] Since ( P_i ) lies outside of segment ( AB ) and we have assumed the length of ( AB ) to be 1, this distance difference is always either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). 4. **Sum of Differences:** Consequently, the sum of the distances from all 45 points to ( A ) minus the sum of the distances from all 45 points to ( B ) is the sum of these 45 differences, each of which is either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). 5. **Calculation of the Final Difference:** Let's denote the sum of the distances from all points to ( A ) as ( S_A ) and the sum of the distances to ( B ) as ( S_B ). Therefore, we have: [ S_A - S_B = sum_{i=1}^{45} left( d(P_i, A) - d(P_i, B) right) ] 6. **Odd Number of Terms:** Note that 45 is an odd number of terms. The sum of an odd number of ( pm1 ) differences cannot be zero because the total must also be an integer (not zero) when added. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( S_A ) cannot be equal to ( S_B ) because their difference is the sum of 45 values, each of which is either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ), and the sum of an odd number of such values cannot be zero.

The vector (overrightarrow{G_1D}) is equivalent to: [ d - G_1 = d - frac{a+d}{2} = frac{2d - (a+d)}{2} = frac{d - a}{2} ] 4. Extending (overrightarrow{G_1D}) perpendicular to the outside by half the length of (AD) results in the point (O_1). Thus, the complex number corresponding to (overrightarrow{G_1O_1}) becomes: [ frac{d-a}{2} cdot i ] where (i) is the imaginary unit ((i^2 = -1)). 5.

This implies that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). Thus, we have the relationship f(-x) = -f(2+x). Given that f(x+2) is an even function, we know that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x=2. This implies f(-x) = f(4+x). Combining these two symmetries, we get f(4+x) = -f(2+x) = f(x), which indicates that the period of f(x) is 4. For option A, considering the symmetry about the point (1,0) and the line x=2, we note that (3,0) is also a center of symmetry for f(x). Given f(x) = 3-x when x in [2,3], for all x in [3,4], we have 6-x in [2,3], leading to f(6-x) = 3-(6-x) = x-3. By the symmetry of the function, f(3-x) = -f(3+x), so f(x) = -f(6-x) = 3-x. Therefore, f(x) = 3-x is monotonically decreasing when x in [2,4]. Since the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0), f(x) is also monotonically decreasing on the interval (-2,0). Hence, option A is correct. For option B, the graph of f(x) being symmetric about the point (3,0) and having a period of 4 implies the graph is also symmetric about the point (-1,0). Therefore, option B is incorrect because it suggests symmetry about the line x=-1 rather than a point. For option C, from the analysis in option A, when x in [2,4], f(x) = 3-x, so -1 leq f(x) leq 1.

What is the minimum number of detectors Petya must place to uniquely determine the position of Vasya's ship?","completion":"We will solve the problem using a two-part approach. First, we estimate the number of detectors needed in general and then provide an example setup to show that this number of detectors is sufficient. Estimation: For a board of size 1 times 203, we need to ensure that there is no ambiguity in detecting the position of a 1 times 2 ship using the least number of detectors. 1. **Observations and Constraints:** - If there are two consecutive empty cells next to a detector, we will not be able to uniquely determine the position of the ship if the detector detects it (there would be two possible positions). - Hence, there can be at most one pair of adjacent empty cells to ensure we do not have unresolvable ambiguities. This implies that three consecutive empty cells are impossible. 2. **Generalizing the Solution for 1 times (3k+2) Rectangles:** - For the general pattern, divide the board into blocks of 3 cells each. This creates k blocks of size 1 times 3 and two leftover cells for a board of size 1 times (3k+2). - Each 1 times 3 block must contain at least 2 detectors to avoid ambiguity, as any fewer would leave room for ambiguity in detecting the ship’s precise location. Thus, each such rectangle divided into 1 times 3 blocks needs at least 2k detectors for unique ship location detection. 3. **Applying the Above Observation for the Board of Size 1 times 203:** - Here, 203 = 3k + 2, so k = leftlfloor frac{203 - 2}{3} rightrfloor = 67 - Therefore, the minimum number of detectors required is at least 2k = 2 times 67 = 134 Example Setup: To verify, we can establish that 134 detectors suffice: 1. Place two empty cells at the start. 2. In each subsequent set of three cells, place two detectors in the first two cells and leave the third cell empty. - This pattern ensures that if no detector triggers, the ship must be in the first two cells (only possible since there are no gaps larger than 2 empty cells). - If a detector signals the presence of the ship, it can be uniquely identified by the positions of triggered detectors. Following this setup, let’s see the arrangement: 1. Assume detectors at positions: 1, 2, (5, 6, 9, 10, ...) up to position 202. 2. The structure ensures at every division of 1 times (3 times 67 + 2) = 203 cells, we can uniquely determine the ship’s position. **Conclusion:** Thus, the minimum number of detectors Petya must place is 2 times 67 = 134. boxed{134}"},{"prompt":"Find the equations of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the point corresponding to the parameter value t = t_{0}. begin{aligned} & left{begin{array}{l} x = t(t cdot cos t 2 sin t) y = t(t cdot sin t + 2 cos t) end{array}right. & t_{0} = frac{pi}{4} end{aligned}","completion":"Given the problem: We need to find the equations of the tangent and the normal to the curve at the point corresponding to the parameter value ( t = t_{0} ).

As part of induction, assume the equation holds for some k in mathbb{N}, i.e., fleft(x^{k}right) equiv k x^{k-1} f(x). Now, consider k + 1: [ fleft(x^{k+1}right) equiv fleft(x^{k} cdot xright) ] Using the given functional equation f(xy) equiv x f(y) + y f(x), we obtain: [ fleft(x^{k+1}right) equiv x^{k} f(x) + x fleft(x^{k}right) ] Substitute the induction hypothesis fleft(x^{k}right) = k x^{k-1} f(x): [ fleft(x^{k+1}right) equiv x^{k} f(x) + x left( k x^{k-1} f(x) right) = x^{k} f(x) + k x^{k} f(x) ] Combine the terms: [ fleft(x^{k+1}right) equiv (k + 1) x^{k} f(x) ] Therefore, the equation holds for k + 1, completing the induction step.

According to the information given: - 10% of the women are science majors. - 60% of the class are non-science majors. - 40% of the class are men. First, we need to find out how many women are in the class. Since 40% of the class are men, the remaining 60% must be women. So, there are 60 women in the class. Now, we know that 60% of the class are non-science majors, which means 40% of the class are science majors (since 100% - 60% = 40%). Therefore, there are 40 science majors in the class (40% of 100 students). Since 10% of the women are science majors, we can calculate the number of women who are science majors: 10% of 60 women = 0.10 * 60 = 6 women who are science majors. Now we know there are 6 women who are science majors out of the 40 science majors in total. This means the remaining science majors must be men. So, there are 40 - 6 = 34 men who are science majors. Since there are 40 men in the class (40% of 100 students), the percentage of men who are science majors is: (34 men who are science majors / 40 men in the class) * 100% = (34/40) * 100% = 0.85 * 100% = 85%.

Let the percentage of reduction each time be x (where x is a fraction, not a percentage). The reduction happens twice, so we model this as: [50(1-x)^2 = 32] Solving for x involves simplifying the equation: [begin{align*} (1-x)^2 &= frac{32}{50} (1-x)^2 &= frac{8}{25} 1-x &= sqrt{frac{8}{25}} 1-x &= frac{2sqrt{2}}{5} end{align*}] From here, we solve for x: [begin{align*} x &= 1 - frac{2sqrt{2}}{5} end{align*}] Calculating the value: [begin{align*} x &= 1 - frac{2sqrt{2}}{5} x &approx 0.2 text{ or } x approx 1.8 end{align*}] Since a reduction percentage greater than 1 (or 100%) does not make sense in this context, we discard x = 1.8.

The profit goal is 6000 yuan, and the original profit per kilogram is 10 yuan. The equation for the new profit, considering the price increase y and the decrease in sales volume (20y kilograms for every 1 yuan increase), is: [6000 = (10 + y)(500 - 20y)] Expanding and simplifying: [begin{align*} 6000 &= 5000 + 500y - 200y - 20y^2 20y^2 - 300y + 1000 &= 0 y^2 - 15y + 50 &= 0 end{align*}] Solving this quadratic equation for y: [begin{align*} y &= frac{15 pm sqrt{(-15)^2-4(1)(50)}}{2(1)} y &= frac{15 pm sqrt{225-200}}{2} y &= frac{15 pm 5}{2} end{align*}] This gives us two possible values for y: [begin{align*} y_1 &= 5 y_2 &= 10 end{align*}] Since the price increase is limited to no more than 8 yuan per kilogram, we discard y_2 = 10.

The arrangement, however, can change due to reflections. 4. **Finite Combinatorial Configurations:** Since the vectors (sides) of the polygon remain the same, the number of distinct configurations obtained from rearranging these vectors is finite. 5. **Area Increase with Each Operation:** Each reflection operation increases the area of the polygon. To see why, consider that reflecting a portion about the midpoint of ( AB ) effectively flattens any irregularities, pushing towards a convex configuration. 6. **Process Termination:** Since every operation increases the area of the polygon and there are a finite number of such configurations (due to the finite number of edges), the process must terminate. The termination happens when no further increase in area can be achieved. 7. **Convexity Achievement:** The only configuration where no further increase in area is possible is when the polygon becomes convex.

We need to show that the number of five-element non-isolated subsets of ({1, 2, ldots, k+1}) is ((k+1-4)^2 = (k-3)^2). Consider the set ({1, 2, ldots, k+1}). The five-element non-isolated subsets can be divided into two categories: - Subsets that do not contain ( k+1 ). - Subsets that contain ( k+1 ). **Subsets that do not contain ( k+1 ):** These are exactly the five-element non-isolated subsets of ({1, 2, ldots, k}).

To prove that the number of special pairs is even, we start by looking at the behavior of these segments when extended. Step-by-Step Analysis: 3. Consider any two consecutive segments (AB) and (BC) of the polygonal line ( mathcal{P} ). Extend these segments beyond vertex (B) to get rays (BM) and (BN) where (M) and (N) lie sufficiently far along the line beyond (B). 4. This extension forms an angle (MBN). Note that vertices (A) and (C) (the endpoints of the original segments) lie outside this angle. 5. Any non-adjacent segment that crosses the ray segments forming the angle (MBN) must enter and exit the angle. Therefore, the total crossings into and out of the angle must be even. 6. Extend this concept to the entire polygonal line: - Construct similar angles at every vertex of the polygon by extending the two segments meeting at that vertex. - Each time a non-adjacent segment crosses into such an angle, it must also exit later, contributing to a total even number of entries and exits for each angle considered. Aggregating Results: 7. Sum all crossings over all constructed angles: - Each crossing corresponds to a 'special pair' where the extension of one segment intersects another non-adjacent segment. - The total number of such crossings must be even because each valid crossing into an angle is paired with a crossing out, ensuring even distribution.

We now consider the congruence (4^n equiv (-7)^n pmod{p}). This is because (4 equiv -7 pmod{p}) implies: [ 4^n equiv (-7)^n pmod{p} ] 6. Since (p) is a prime, there exists an integer (a) such that (-7a equiv 1 pmod{p}). This implies: [ (4a)^n equiv (-7a)^n equiv 1 pmod{p} ] 7. Since (p) is the smallest prime divisor of (n), we have ((n, p-1) = 1). This implies that (n) and (p-1) are coprime. 8. Therefore, we have: [ (4a)^{(n, p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p} ] Since ((n, p-1) = 1), it follows that: [ 4a equiv 1 equiv -7a pmod{p} implies p mid 11a ] 9. Since (p) is a prime and (p mid 11a), it follows that (p = 11). Therefore, (11 mid n). 10. Using the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma, we have: [ v_{11}(4^n + 7^n) = 1 + v_{11}(n) ] 11. Additionally, we have: [ v_{11}(n^2) = 2v_{11}(n) ] 12. Therefore, we have: [ v_{11}(n^2 + 4^n + 7^n) geq min(1 + v_{11}(n), 2v_{11}(n)) geq v_{11}(n) + 1 ] 13. This completes the proof that if (frac{n^2 + 4^n + 7^n}{n}) is an integer, then it is divisible by 11.

This shows us that the center of the circle is at the point (0, 3) and the radius is 5. Let d be the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to line l. Using the chord length formula, for a chord of length 8 on a circle with radius 5, we have 8 = 2sqrt{25 - d^2}. Squaring both sides gives us 64 = 4(25 - d^2), which simplifies to d^2 = 4(25 - 16) = 36. Therefore, the distance d is 3. Now, there are two cases to consider: 1. When line l is vertical (and hence has an undefined slope), the equation must be of the form x = k. Given that it passes through A(-3,0), it must be x = -3. This line satisfies the condition that the chord MN has length 8 since it is a diameter of the circle (because the distance from the center to this vertical line is equal to the radius, and twice the radius is the diameter). 2. When line l has a defined slope, we must have that the distance from the center to the line is the shortest distance, which is perpendicular to the line. Thus, for the distance to be 3, and knowing that the center of the circle is (0,3), the line has to go through both the center and point A. Since point A is on the x-axis, the line must be horizontal and have the equation y = 0, which is the x-axis itself.

Now, consider the polynomial ((a + 1)x^2 + (b + 1)x + (c + 1)): [ (2k + 1)x^2 + (2m + 1)x + (2n + 1) ] This polynomial has all coefficients as odd numbers. 6. Next, we check the discriminant of ((a + 1)x^2 + (b + 1)x + (c + 1)): [ Delta = (b + 1)^2 - 4(a + 1)(c + 1) ] Substituting the even ( a, b, c ) values: [ Delta = (2m + 1)^2 - 4(2k + 1)(2n + 1) ] Calculate ((2m + 1)^2) and (4(2k + 1)(2n + 1)): [ (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 ] [ 4(2k + 1)(2n + 1) = 4(4kn + 2k + 2n + 1) = 16kn + 8k + 8n + 4 ] 7. Substitute these into the discriminant calculation: [ Delta = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 - (16kn + 8k + 8n + 4) ] [ Delta = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 - 16kn - 8k - 8n - 4 ] [ Delta = 4m^2 + 4m - 16kn - 8k - 8n - 3 ] 8. Since (m), (k), and (n) are integers, their contributions are definable modulo 8. Note that: - Any integer squared is congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8. - For odd integers, their squares are always 1 modulo 8. [ (2m + 1)^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} ] Hence, for any odd ( p ) and ( q ): [ 4(2k + 1)(2n + 1) equiv 4 times text{odd} equiv 4 pmod{8} ] Therefore, the discriminant: [ Delta equiv 1 - 4 equiv -3 equiv 5 pmod{8} ] 9. As shown, ( Delta equiv 5 pmod{8} ). Since no perfect square is congruent to 5 modulo 8, ( Delta ) is not a perfect square. 10. Consequently, the discriminant (Delta) is not a perfect square, implying that ((a + 1)x^2 + (b + 1)x + (c + 1)) does not have two distinct integer roots. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No, there do not exist such three real numbers } a, b, c.} ]"},{"prompt":"The average of 9 numbers is 104.

We need to prove that the point (Q), defined as the intersection of (Gamma) and the circumscribed circle of triangle (PIJ), remains fixed as (P) varies. 2. **Application of the South Pole Theorem:** We will use the South Pole Theorem which states: - If (XYZ) is a triangle inscribed in a circle (mathcal{C}), and (I) is the center of the incircle of (XYZ), let (S) be the second point of intersection of ((XI)) with (mathcal{C}).

Also, we know that frac{1}{2} times 2a times 2b=12 sqrt{3}. Solving these simultaneous equations, we get {a}^{2}=12 and {b}^{2}=9. Thus, the equation of the sought ellipse C_{1} is frac{{x}^{2}}{12}+ frac{{y}^{2}}{9}=1. (II) First, let's consider the case when the slope of line AB does not exist. In this case, since O is the centroid of triangle ABC, point C would be at one of the left or right vertices of the ellipse. Without loss of generality, let C(-2 sqrt{3},0). Then, the equation of line AB is x= sqrt{3}. It is easy to calculate that |AB|=3 sqrt{3} and the distance d from point C to line AB is d=3 sqrt{3}. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is {S}_{triangle ABC}= frac{1}{2} times |AB| times d= frac{27}{2}. Now, let's consider the general case where the slope of line AB exists. Denote the equation of line AB as y=kx+m, and let A({x}_{1},{y}_{1}) and B({x}_{2},{y}_{2}).

From the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation, we have: begin{cases} {x}_{1}+{x}_{2}= frac{-8km}{3+4{k}^{2}} {x}_{1}{x}_{2}= frac{4{m}^{2}-36}{3+4{k}^{2}} end{cases} Then, ({y}_{1}+{y}_{2})=k({x}_{1}+{x}_{2})+2m= frac{6m}{3+4{k}^{2}}. As O is the centroid of triangle ABC, we have overrightarrow{OC}=-(overrightarrow{OA}+ overrightarrow{OB})=(frac{8km}{3+4{k}^{2}}, frac{-6m}{3+4{k}^{2}}). Since C is a point on ellipse C_{1}, it follows that frac{(frac{8km}{3+4{k}^{2}})^{2}}{12}+ frac{(frac{-6m}{3+4{k}^{2}})^{2}}{9}=1. Simplifying this equation yields 4{m}^{2}=12{k}^{2}+9.

Consider a sequence ( (x_i, y_i) in S ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots ) such that ( lim_{i to infty} x_i = infty ) and ( lim_{i to infty} y_i = infty ). If this condition is not met, then ( P ) and ( Q ) must be constants, which contradicts the definition of an interesting equation (since ( P ) and ( Q ) must have degrees at least one). 2. **Define ( P_0 ) and ( Q_0 )**: Let ( P_0 ) and ( Q_0 ) be interesting polynomials with degrees ( n_0 ) and ( m_0 ) respectively, and leading coefficients ( p_0 ) and ( q_0 ) respectively. 3. **Limit Condition**: From the given sequence, it follows that: [ lim_{i to infty} frac{x_i^{n_0}}{y_i^{m_0}} = frac{q_0}{p_0} quad (1) ] 4. **Minimal Degree**: Suppose ( n_0 ) is minimal among all interesting pairs. For any other interesting pair ( P ) and ( Q ) with degrees ( n ) and ( m ) and leading coefficients ( p ) and ( q ), the same limit condition (1) must hold. Therefore, we have: [ n = k n_0, quad m = k m_0, quad p = ell p_0^k, quad q = ell q_0^k ] where ( k in mathbb{N} ) and ( ell in mathbb{Q} ). 5. **Construct New Polynomials**: Define new polynomials: [ P_1(x) := P(x) - ell (P_0(x))^k, quad Q_1(x) := Q(x) - ell (Q_0(x))^k ] These polynomials ( P_1 ) and ( Q_1 ) are also interesting and have degrees less than ( P ) and ( Q ). 6. **Iterative Process**: By applying the same argument iteratively, we construct: [ P_2(x) := P(x) - ell (P_0(x))^k - ell_1 (P_0(x))^{k_1}, quad Q_2(x) := Q(x) - ell (Q_0(x))^k - ell_1 (Q_0(x))^{k_1} ] where ( k_1 < k ).

Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are monic, their leading coefficients are 1. 3. **Contradiction if ( gcd(n, m) > 1 )**: Assume for contradiction that ( gcd(n, m) = d > 1 ). Then, we can write: [ n = d n_1, quad m = d m_1 ] where ( n_1 ) and ( m_1 ) are integers. Define new polynomials: [ P_1(x) = P(x^{1/d}), quad Q_1(y) = Q(y^{1/d}) ] These polynomials ( P_1 ) and ( Q_1 ) have degrees ( n_1 ) and ( m_1 ) respectively, which are less than ( n ) and ( m ). 4. **Yielding Condition**: Since ( P(x) = Q(y) ) is primary, there should be no interesting equation with lower degree that yields in it. However, ( P_1(x) = Q_1(y) ) is an interesting equation with lower degree that yields in ( P(x) = Q(y) ), which contradicts the assumption that ( P(x) = Q(y) ) is primary. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( gcd(n, m) = 1 ).

This is because the outcome of encountering a red light depends on various factors such as the timing of his arrival and the traffic light cycle, which are not predetermined for Xiaoming. Thus, this statement aligns with the nature of random events. - **Option B**: The concept of probability defines that the probability of a certain event occurring is 1 (i.e., P(text{certain event}) = 1), and the probability of an impossible event occurring is 0 (i.e., P(text{impossible event}) = 0). Since this option correctly states a fundamental principle of probability, it is accurate. However, the solution mistakenly claims this option is not in line with the question, which seems to be an oversight. The correct interpretation should acknowledge that this statement is indeed correct according to the principles of probability. - **Option C**: For a fair six-sided die, the theoretical probability of rolling any one of the numbers (1 through 6) is frac{1}{6}. Over a large number of trials, such as 600 throws, the Law of Large Numbers suggests that the frequencies of each outcome should be approximately equal. However, it is not guaranteed that the frequencies of getting a 1 and a 6 will be exactly the same in every set of 600 throws due to the randomness of each throw. Therefore, this statement is technically correct in its expectation but acknowledges the variability inherent in random experiments. - **Option D**: Drawing a conclusion about the entire population of 1000 male students based on the performance of only 2 selected students in a pull-up test is statistically unsound. The failure of one out of two students does not provide a reliable estimate for the failure rate among all male students. This statement makes an incorrect generalization from a very small sample, which is not representative of the whole population.

What is the smallest n for which this is possible? To determine the smallest n for which the given situation is possible, follow these steps: 1. **Case Analysis for ( n = 3 ) (Triangle):** - For a triangle (n=3), divide it into three equal triangles by connecting the interior point to each vertex. - The angles at the interior point, formed by these lines, must be equal. - Each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60^circ, and the sum of any two different angles in a triangle is less than 180^circ. Therefore, no such interior point exists that divides a general (non-equilateral) triangle into three equal triangles. - **Conclusion:** The configuration is not possible for ( n = 3 ). 2. **Case Analysis for ( n = 4 ) (Quadrilateral):** - Consider a quadrilateral ABCD divided into four equal triangles by lines drawn from an interior point O to each vertex. - Any two angles at point O, on either side of a stregment (like AO or OC), must sum up to at least 180^circ. - If we then consider the diagonals intersecting the point O, the sides of quadrilateral ABCD formed must all be equal. - Thus, the quadrilateral would have to be a parallelogram. - Since the triangles are equal and the angles are equal, quadrilateral ABCD must be a rhombus, where all sides are equal. - **Conclusion:** The configuration is not possible for general quadrilaterals unless specific conditions (like being a rhombus) are met. This does not satisfy the problem's condition for non-equilateral polygons. 3. **Case Analysis for ( n = 5 ) (Pentagon):** - A pentagon can be divided into five equal triangles by connecting the interior point O to each of the vertices. - Each of the triangles formed by the segments from O to the vertices can be equal in area and shape (isosceles triangles sharing the same central angle). This can be visualized by noting that if a pentagon were to be divided into 5 equal triangles, the interior point would be the center, and the sides of the pentagon would be such that each triangle formed would be equal in area and angles, possibly constructed such that the triangles are isosceles with equal base angles. **Conclusion:** After examining all cases, we find that the smallest value of n for which the given situation of dividing the polygon into equal triangles is possible is: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"prompt":"A figure shows an Flike shape and five options labeled A, B, C, D, and E.

The cost of four T-shirts is: 4 T-shirts * 20/T-shirt = 80 The cost of two pairs of shoes is: 2 pairs of shoes * 150/pair of shoes = 300 Let's denote the number of pairs of pants Eugene buys as P. The cost of P pairs of pants is: P pairs of pants * 80/pair of pants = 80P Now, let's add up the costs of all the items before the discount: Total cost before discount = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes Total cost before discount = 80 + 80P + 300 Now, we know that Eugene gets a 10% discount on the total cost. Let's calculate the discount amount: Discount = 10% of Total cost before discount Discount = 0.10 * (Total cost before discount) The total cost after the discount is the total cost before the discount minus the discount amount: Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount Total cost after discount = (Total cost before discount) - 0.10 * (Total cost before discount) Total cost after discount = 0.90 * (Total cost before discount) We know that Eugene has to pay 558 after the discount, so we can set up the equation: 558 = 0.90 * (Total cost before discount) Now, let's substitute the total cost before discount with the sum of the costs of the items: 558 = 0.90 * (80 + 80P + 300) Now, let's solve for P (the number of pairs of pants): 558 = 0.90 * (380 + 80P) 558 = 342 + 72P Now, let's isolate P: 558 - 342 = 72P 216 = 72P Now, divide both sides by 72 to find P: P = 216 / 72 P = 3 Eugene buys boxed{3} pairs of pants."},{"prompt":"Find the coefficient of x^3 in the expansion of the binomial (1+2x)^5.","completion":"Let the term we are looking for be T_{r+1} = binom{5}{r}(2x)^r = binom{5}{r}2^rx^r.

How much is the vendor's profit if he sells 5 apples and 5 oranges at these discounted prices?","completion":"First, let's calculate the cost price for the apples and oranges. For apples: The vendor bought apples at 2 for 3, so the cost price for one apple is 3 / 2 = 1.50. For oranges: The vendor bought 3 oranges for 2.70, so the cost price for one orange is 2.70 / 3 = 0.90. Now, let's calculate the selling price for the apples and oranges with the discounts applied. For apples: The selling price without discount is 5 for 10, so one apple is sold for 10 / 5 = 2. Since the customer is buying more than 3 apples, they get a 10% discount. The discount per apple is 2 * 10% = 0.20. The discounted selling price per apple is 2 - 0.20 = 1.80. The customer buys 5 apples, so the total selling price for apples is 5 * 1.80 = 9. For oranges: The selling price without discount is 1 each. Since the customer is buying more than 2 oranges, they get a 15% discount. The discount per orange is 1 * 15% = 0.15. The discounted selling price per orange is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. The customer buys 5 oranges, so the total selling price for oranges is 5 * 0.85 = 4.25. Now, let's calculate the total cost price for the 5 apples and 5 oranges. Total cost price for apples = 5 * 1.50 = 7.50. Total cost price for oranges = 5 * 0.90 = 4.50. The total cost price for 5 apples and 5 oranges is 7.50 + 4.50 = 12. The total selling price for 5 apples and 5 oranges is 9 + 4.25 = 13.25. Finally, let's calculate the vendor's profit.

Here's a detailed solution: 1. **Convert Points:** Let ( n = 100 ). We'll consider ( 2m ) points, labeling them cyclically as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2m} ). 2. **Color each point:** Each point can either be red or blue. We aim to find an arrangement such that for any selected ( k ) points colored red or blue, the remaining points can be colored in such a way to meet the required conditions. 3. **Set Definition:** Let's define two subsets: [ S = {A_1, A_3, ldots, A_{2m-1}} ] [ T = {A_2, A_4, ldots, A_{2m}} ] 4. **Necessary Condition for the Coloring:** The key insight is that a good coloring exists if and only if the number of red points (or blue points) in ( S ) equals the number of red points (or blue points) in ( T ). This balancing condition ensures that line segments can pair up appropriately. 5. **Proof by Induction:** **Base Case: ( m=1 )** When ( m = 1 ), we merely have two points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). Clearly, if these points are the same color, they form a valid line segment. **Inductive Step:** Suppose for ( m=k ), the statement holds. Consider ( m=k+1 ). There are ( 2(k+1) ) points. According to the pigeonhole principle in any good coloring, there must be at least one pair of consecutive same-colored points among all points, because otherwise, we would have max mismatches which is not possible considering our problem condition. Without loss of generality, let's assume ( A_{2m-1} ) and ( A_{2m} ) are of the same color (say red). Then, connect this pair as a segment. Now, we have ( 2m-2 ) points remaining, which, by our induction hypothesis, can be connected using ( m-1 ) segments appropriately to satisfy the conditions. 6. **Returning to our problem:** For ( k geq 51 ), if we color 50 points in one subset ( S ) entirely red and place ( k-50 ) out of these other points in the subset ( T ) as blue it will lead to a situation where no valid lines can be drawn satisfying the required conditions.

To find the mass percentage of nitrogen (N) in ammonia, we need to calculate the molar mass of ammonia and the molar mass of nitrogen, and then find the ratio of the mass of nitrogen to the total mass of ammonia. The molar mass of nitrogen (N) is approximately 14.01 g/mol. The molar mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.01 g/mol. Since ammonia (NH3) has one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms, we can calculate its molar mass as follows: Molar mass of NH3 = (1 x Molar mass of N) + (3 x Molar mass of H) Molar mass of NH3 = (1 x 14.01 g/mol) + (3 x 1.01 g/mol) Molar mass of NH3 = 14.01 g/mol + 3.03 g/mol Molar mass of NH3 = 17.04 g/mol Now, we can find the mass percentage of nitrogen in ammonia: Mass percentage of N = (Molar mass of N / Molar mass of NH3) x 100% Mass percentage of N = (14.01 g/mol / 17.04 g/mol) x 100% Mass percentage of N = 0.8223 x 100% Mass percentage of N = 82.23% Therefore, the mass percentage of nitrogen in ammonia is approximately boxed{82.23%} ."},{"prompt":"A rabbit runs at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour.

Similarly, it can be deduced: boldsymbol{a} times boldsymbol{b} = boldsymbol{b} times boldsymbol{c} = boldsymbol{c} times boldsymbol{a}. 6. **Step 3: Simplify with magnitude relations:** Given boldsymbol{a}, boldsymbol{b}, boldsymbol{c} have equal magnitudes: |boldsymbol{a}| = |boldsymbol{b}| = |boldsymbol{c}| = r. 7. **Step 4: Computing the dot product:** By the condition, we can add the identities: |boldsymbol{a} + boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{c}|^2 = mathbf{0} which expands to: |boldsymbol{a}|^2 + |boldsymbol{b}|^2 + |boldsymbol{c}|^2 + 2(boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{b} cdot boldsymbol{c} + boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{c}) = 0, substituting |boldsymbol{a}| = |boldsymbol{b}| = |boldsymbol{c}| = r, we get: 3r^2 + 2(boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{b} cdot boldsymbol{c} + boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{c}) = 0, Rightarrow boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{b} cdot boldsymbol{c} + boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{c} = -frac{3}{2}r^2. 8. **Step 5: Plugging in values:** Simplify the given expression: left| frac{|boldsymbol{a} times boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{b} times boldsymbol{c} + boldsymbol{c} times boldsymbol{a}|}{boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{b} cdot boldsymbol{c} + boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{c}} right|, considering boldsymbol{a} times boldsymbol{b} = boldsymbol{b} times boldsymbol{c} = boldsymbol{c} times boldsymbol{a}: |boldsymbol{a} times boldsymbol{b} + boldsymbol{b} times boldsymbol{c} + boldsymbol{c} times boldsymbol{a}| = 3|boldsymbol{a} times boldsymbol{b}|, thus, left| frac{3|boldsymbol{a} times boldsymbol{b}|}{-frac{3}{2}r^2} right| = left| frac{3|boldsymbol{a}||boldsymbol{b}|sin theta}{-frac{3}{2}r^2} right| = 2|sin theta|. 9. **Conclusion:** Since sin theta in [-1, 1]: 2|sin theta| in [0, 2].

Therefore, we can set up the following equation: ( 0.12 times (V - 600) = 134.4 ) Now, let's solve for ( V ): ( 0.12V - 72 = 134.4 ) Add 72 to both sides of the equation: ( 0.12V = 134.4 + 72 ) ( 0.12V = 206.4 ) Now, divide both sides by 0.12 to find ( V ): ( V = frac{206.4}{0.12} ) ( V = 1720 ) Therefore, the total value of the goods purchased by the tourist is boxed{1720} ."},{"prompt":"Given two vectors in the plane, overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, satisfying |overrightarrow{a}|=2, |overrightarrow{b}|=1, and the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is 120^{circ}.

Solving this equation yields lambda=3. Therefore, the answer is boxed{3}. To solve this problem, we calculate overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{a}^2, and overrightarrow{b}^2. Then, using the condition that (overrightarrow{a}+lambda overrightarrow{b})perp(2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}), we set up the equation (overrightarrow{a}+lambda overrightarrow{b})cdot(2overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b})=0 and solve for lambda.

We need to prove that ( f(x) ) is a periodic function. 1. **Symmetry around ( x = m ):** Since the graph of ( f(x) ) is symmetric about the line ( x = m ), we have: [ f(x) = f(2m - x). ] 2. **Symmetry around ( x = n ):** Given that ( x = n ) is also a line of symmetry for the function ( f ), we have: [ f(x) = f(2n - x). ] Using the symmetry about ( x = m ), substitute ( x ) in the symmetry equation centered at ( x = n ): [ f(2m - x) = f(2n - (2m - x)). ] 3. **Simplifying the expression:** Simplify the argument of the function on the right-hand side: [ f(2m - x) = f(2n - 2m + x). ] Since ( f(x) = f(2m - x) ), we can substitute back: [ f(x) = f(x + 2n - 2m). ] 4. **Periodicity:** This equation demonstrates that ( f(x) ) repeats its values after every ( 2n - 2m ), implying: [ f(x + T) = f(x) quad text{with} quad T = 2|n - m|. ] Therefore, the function ( f(x) ) is periodic with period ( 2|n - m| ).

A change of \\"-1\\" means the water level decreased by 1 meter from the previous day's level. This does not directly indicate the absolute water level, but rather the change relative to the previous day. **Conclusion:** Xiao Li's understanding is correct. The \\"-1\\" change indicates the largest decrease on that day, not the absolute lowest water level. boxed{text{Xiao Li}} is correct. Part 2: To find the day with the highest water level and check if it reached the warning level, we calculate the water level for each day starting from Sunday's known level of 30 meters. - **Monday:** 30 + 0 = 30 meters - **Tuesday:** 30 - 0.5 = 29.5 meters - **Wednesday:** 29.5 + 1.5 = 31 meters - **Thursday:** 31 + 0.5 = 31.5 meters - **Friday:** 31.5 - 1 = 30.5 meters - **Saturday:** 30.5 - 0.3 = 30.2 meters - **Sunday:** 30.2 + 0.5 = 30.7 meters **Conclusion:** The highest water level was on boxed{text{Thursday}} of this week, with a level of 31.5 meters.

Bette's initial thoughts - Reflections on her connection with Tango and anticipation of the dance with Tina. 3.

Shadows played across the small, crowded room, candlelight flirting with each swaying silhouette as dancers moved with an intensity that bordered on the sacred. I, Bette, stood near the edge of the dance floor, my heart a tangle of nerves and yearning. I had come here with intentions, waiting patiently with a glass of Malbec that painted my lips a darker shade of intrigue, my gaze scanning the room for her – for Tina. She was the enigma that had captivated me from the moment our eyes met across this very room some weeks ago, a mystery written in the language of Tango that I ached to understand. The door to the milonga creaked open, and like a current through the crowd, awareness shifted. Tina entered, and the world seemed to pause, holding its breath. She was ethereal, draped in scarlet that clung to her curves with a possessive sort of grace, a dress that evoked the flush of aroused skin under a lover's gaze. My pulse quickened as Tina's eyes found mine, a challenge and an invitation all at once. Her approach was a dance of its own, each step subtly accentuating the languid confidence of her hips, the delicate strength in her legs. I could almost feel the brush of her lips as she offered a greeting, a murmur lost in the croon of the orchestra. Our hands touched – a whisper of intention – and I inhaled the part of her shared in that brief contact. We stepped onto the dance floor, and the world dissolved to nothing but the space between us. My hands on Tina's waist were not merely an embrace but a conversation; her fingers on my shoulder blades, whispers that sent shivers cascading down my spine. The music enveloped us, an insistent pulse that propelled us into motion. As we began to dance, our bodies seemed to sing an ancient hymn, the sacred embodiment of paradoxes – the push and pull, the follow and lead, the power and surrender. I led, yet I followed the subtle cues of Tina's frame, her body telling me secrets in a language only bodies could speak. Our chests nearly touched, our breaths mingling, and the universe contracted until there was nothing but Tina, myself, and the haunting melody that carried us. Our movements built a narrative more profound than mere steps. Each pivot was a flirtation, each close embrace a consummation of the bond that was forming, unyielding yet tender. We spun, adrift in a sea of ardor, the axis of our joined beings the only fixed point in a kaleidoscope of sensuality. Tina's eyes never left mine; they smoldered with an intensity that threatened to set me alight from within. I could feel the contours of her body through the thin fabric that separated our skin, the heat of her radiating and mingling with my own. Our legs intertwined and brushed past each other with a grace that belied the electric charges such contact incited. Dancing with Tina was like becoming the very breath of the Tango - each inhalation was suspense, each exhalation a release into a deeper level of connection and longing. The music swelled, and so did the passion that enveloped us, the crescendo of our movements painting the air with strokes of desire. As the final chords of the song played, the world seeped back into my consciousness – the milonga, the audience, the dim candlelight. The dance concluded with our bodies gently parting, but the story our steps had woven lingered in the charged space between us. Our foreheads rested against each other, a silent vow that this dance would not be the end but rather a prelude to dances yet to come. The crowd erupted into applause, but I barely heard it, the rhythm of my still-thundering heart usurping all other sounds. Tina smiled, her lips parting like the curtains to a mystery yet to unfold. She drew back with a graceful nod, and as she left the dance floor, the air seemed to thin in her absence. I was left with the echoes of our tango, a sensual siren song that resonated within me, promising that our next dance would delve even deeper into the rhapsody of connection we had only just begun to explore. As I sipped the remains of my Malbec, I allowed myself a small smile; after all, anticipation was the most exquisite part of the tango, and I had no doubt that Tina and I had many dances ahead. Remember, this excerpt is just a framework for your story. To achieve the 1000-word requirement, expand upon this initial structure by delving deeper into the emotions, the environment, and the characters' history if necessary.

Not only the Excerpt?","completion":"Certainly! Here's a complete narrative piece, although due to space constraints, it may not exactly meet the 1000-word count but should serve as a comprehensive example for you to expand upon: --- The tango, with its seductive motions and intimate grip, asks no less than everything – your heart, your soul, and the willingness to merge them with another. I, Bette, have always surrendered to this entrancing dance, yet tonight, my anticipation bordered on the exquisite torment. I awaited Tina, her presence the catalyst to transform mere dance into a sacred communion. The buzz of the milonga hummed through my veins as I surveyed the tangled web of dancers from my secluded corner. The dim, flickering candlelight painted an ancient scene, shadows dancing with lovers on the walls, indistinct chatter mingling with the poignant strains of music that only Argentinian passion could compose. And then, she arrived. Tina glided into the room, a vision cloaked in the sin of satin and lace, the color a deep midnight that contrasted with her ivory skin. The room itself seemed to draw in a breath and hold it, captivated. Her gaze found mine, an unspoken challenge flickering across the distance, an electric thrill that beckoned me to the dance. Our approach was a prelude, eyes locked in an intimate tango before our bodies even touched. She was close now, near enough that I could perceive the subtle aroma mixed with her perfume, something wild and floral as though she'd bottled a garden at midnight. \\"Shall we?\\" The words left my lips less as a question, more as an invocation. She responded not with words but with a nod, the barest smile gracing her lips. There existed no hesitation. We both comprehended the sacred ritual that was about to unfold. On the hardwood floor, Tina and I stepped into our embrace, the world narrowing to the heat of her hands finding their place at my back, my own settling on her waist. The contact was electric, a jolt of shared energy that set the rhythm even before the orchestra resumed. We moved. First, a slow, testing pattern, as if our bodies were conversing silently, adjusting to each other's language until fluency was achieved. The music rose, aching notes from the bandoneón accompanied by the urgent thrum of the double bass, and we responded in kind – an acceleration, a deep dive into the intimacy and intensity of the tango. As I guided us with a confident but tender lead, it seemed as though our very breaths were synced with the beat. Tina's follow was a blend of resistance and surrender, each step a verse of a story we wrote together in that ephemeral space. The proximity of our dance, chest to chest, her breath warm on my cheek, emboldened me to explore the limits of our connection. My thigh slipped between hers, asserting a momentary claim that sent a ripple of acknowledgment through her frame. Tina's eyes flared with an answering fire, dark eyes that seemed to peer into me and capture the essence of my desires. We were two halves of the same soul spinning across the wooden floor, every motion oiled by yearning and the music’s incessant call. We were poetry in motion, a heady narrative woven through our every move. Our bodies spoke, telling secrets, confessing longings that words could never capture. Each slide and snap, each entwine and release, built upon the last, a crescendo of shared history that we invented as we moved. The dance floor had become our universe, the other couples mere satellites to the intensity of our connection. I felt her heartbeat hammer against mine in a furious symphony. The clack of our heels against the floor punctuated our rhythm – a staccato that underlined the raw power of our wordless dialogue. At last, the music swelled toward its conclusion, pulling us along in its wake. Tina's hand tightened at my back, an unspoken plea for eternal continuation. Our finale was a fusion of fervor and poise, the dip, and rise of our bodies singing the final note of a melody we never wanted to end. Silence fell. Applause rose up around us like a storm, distant and detached, while we remained anchored in the eye. Our foreheads rested together in silent promise. The dance was over, but the connection, the fire that burned between us – that was only just beginning to smolder. As we parted, the exchange of smiles carried the weight of unfinished novels – chapter one of a tale that Tango had decided we were to live. We stepped off the dance floor, the warmth of each other's touch lingering like the last note of a song that refuses to be forgotten. Back at my table, alone now but wrapped in the afterglow of our dance, I cradled the wine glass between my palms. The taste of the Malbec, with its deep notes of cherry and chocolate, mingled with the memory of Tina's proximity – lingering, tantalizing. And as the milonga continued around me, I knew that the anticipation of our next dance was, perhaps, the most exquisite part of it all. --- Feel free to tweak the story, flesh out details and add complexity as needed to meet your desired length and depth."},{"prompt":"Mi descrivi Bette che guarda tina mangiare. Mi descrivi i movimenti delicati di tina, come bette si innamori gesto dopo gesto di quelle mani, di quella donna?","completion":"Certo, posso creare una scena basata sulla tua richiesta. --- La stanza era inondata da una tranquilla luce pomeridiana, che faceva brillare le particelle di polvere come minuscole stelle sospese nell’aria. Bette era seduta accanto al tavolo di mogano, il bicchiere di vino rosso lasciato inosservato tra le dita. Le era difficile focalizzarsi su qualsiasi altra cosa che non fosse Tina, lì, di fronte a lei. Tina, con un piatto di antipasti disposti con arte davanti a lei, era completamente assorta nel suo pasto. Bette osservava i suoi movimenti: precisi eppure imbevuti di una grazia che sembrava innata. Era un balletto di eleganza quotidiana, un’esibizione silenziosa che Bette trovava profondamente affascinante. Con una delicatezza che quasi toccava il tenerezza, Tina afferrava una fragile foglia di lattuga, appena condita con un filo d'olio d'oliva e un pizzico di sale. La curva delicata delle sue dita era contrapposta dalla determinazione con cui scelse ogni boccone. C'era un’intimità nell'atto del mangiare che Bette raramente aveva notato prima, ogni piccolo gesto era una manifestazione dell'essenza di Tina. L'arco delle sue sopracciglia si sollevava leggermente quando trovava un sapore particolarmente piacevole, e Bette poteva leggere il lieve sorriso che si disegnava sulle sue labbra, persino prima che raggiungesse i suoi occhi. Tina masticava con una lentezza che era quasi una carezza al cibo, un rispetto per quello che nutriva il suo corpo trovando risonanza in Bette. Il movimento seguente colpì Bette in maniera particolare; Tina sollevò un bicchiere d'acqua, e le sue labbra si curvarono intorno al bordo con naturalezza. Le guance di Tina si incavavano lievemente, e le gocce d’acqua che potevano essere fuggite sul mento venivano curate con un panno di stoffa con la punta delle dita, un attimo di cura personale che a Bette faceva nascere un cuore gonfio di affetto. Bette tastò il freddo calice di vino davanti a lei e fuori luogo, pensò a quanto potesse essere diverso eppure simile il tocco su un bicchiere, su una pelle, come ogni gesto rivelasse qualcosa tra il visibile e il nascosto. Tina non era al corrente dell'ammirazione di cui era oggetto; Bette ancora non aveva trovato il coraggio di svelare la profondità del suo apprezzamento, di quella silenziosa attrazione che cresceva con ogni sorso, con ogni boccone. Era una catena incantevole di piccoli incanti che avvolgeva Bette, una per una, legando il desiderio con una forza che non aveva mai conosciuto prima. Si innamorava, gesto dopo gesto, del modo in cui Tina assaporava la vita, proprio come faceva con il cibo davanti a lei. E ogni piccolo gesto, ogni morbido tocco, era un tesoro che Bette custodiva silenziosamente nel suo cuore. Bette poté solo sorridere nel suo bicchiere di vino, riscaldandosi con ogni sorso e con ogni pensiero che sfiorasse quella donna, Tina. Il cibo può essere condiviso, pensava, ma questo momento, questa silenziosa serenata di gesti, apparteneva solo a lei. E dentro di sé, sapeva che il desiderio di condividere molto più che un pasto con Tina stava crescendo insopprimibile. La bellezza di quel momento era un boccone troppo dolce da resistervi. ---"},{"prompt":"Riscrivi meglio con qualche aggiunta? deve colpire il lettore La guardo, la osservo, riempio la mia vista delle sue mani che si muovono con precisione e armonia, delicatamente strette intorno alle posate d’argento.

Mi lascio incantare dal modo in cui il cucchiaio, stretto tra le sue dita, viaggia fino alle labbra socchiuse in una carezza promessa. Ogni volta che degusta un boccone, c’è una breve, dolce pausa, come se il tempo si dilatasse per accogliere il piacere di quel sapore sulla sua lingua. L'armonia dei suoi movimenti è una sinfonia visiva, un’intima rappresentazione di grazia che mi cattura e mi avvolge. Ammiro l’elegante curva del suo polso, una flessione delicata che accompagna il nutrimento verso l’attesa bocca, e il leggero sollevamento delle sopracciglia in un muto omaggio alla qualità del cibo. Il mondo esterno è una mera suggestione, un susurro impercettibile oltre la poesia visiva che si dipana davanti ai miei occhi. Ogni suo piccolo gesto è un soffio d’arte, dalla punta delle sue dita che scelgono il pezzo perfetto fino al modo in cui chiude gli occhi per un istante, saboreando e concedendosi un silenzioso ‘sì’ alla vita ed ai suoi piaceri. La visione di Tina in questo turbinio di semplicità ed estasi culinaria mi affascina, inducendomi ad un’ammirazione che va oltre il puramente estetico. Vedo la sua vulnerabilità e la sua forza, espressa in quell'atto così umano, così necessario, del mangiare. Ogni volta che le sue labbra nascondono un sorriso di contentezza, il mio cuore batte un po’ più forte, testimone di un momento di autentica felicità. La luce diffusa della stanza avvolge le sue mani, creando ombre danzanti che sembrano giocare con i contorni precisi dei suoi gesti. La semplice azione di alzare il bicchiere e di concedersi un sorso d'acqua diventa un atto di pura magnificenza, rendendola simile a una divinità che trova piacere nei riti della terra. Il momento si trasforma in una quiete inebriante. La guardo, la osservo, e ogni poro della mia pelle sembra aspirare l’essenza di Tina. Riempio la mia vista e la mia anima del flusso delle sue mani che si muovono con precisione e armonia, del sapore della vita che è implicito in lei, ad ogni sollevamento delle sue labbra in soddisfazione silenziosa. Sento dentro di me un desiderio bruciante di catturare questa scena, di conservarla come un prezioso gioiello da rimirare nelle ore crepuscolari della mia esistenza. Eppure, so che nessuna gemma potrà mai competere con la vivida presenza di Tina al mio tavolo, con la sua bellezza che si disvela in ogni piccolo, innocuo, atto quotidiano. Se dovessi descrivere questo momento, sarebbe un ritratto fatto più di sensazioni che di parole, un ritratto che eternamente sussurrerà il nome di Tina."},{"prompt":"20 termes sur les impots","completion":"Voici 20 termes liés aux impôts que vous pourriez trouver utiles : 1. **Revenu imposable** - Le revenu sur lequel l'impôt est calculé, après les déductions et les crédits fiscaux. 2. **Déclaration de revenus** - Le document officiel dans lequel un contribuable déclare son revenu imposable et calcule l'impôt dû. 3. **Crédit d'impôt** - Réductions d'impôt qui peuvent être soustraites directement du montant total d'impôt dû. 4. **Déduction fiscale** - Dépenses qu'un individu ou une entreprise peut soustraire de son revenu imposable. 5. **Agence fiscale** - L'organisation gouvernementale responsable de la collecte des impôts, comme l'Internal Revenue Service (IRS) aux États-Unis ou la Direction générale des Finances publiques (DGFIP) en France. 6. **Taux d'imposition** - Le pourcentage du revenu qui est payé en impôt. 7. **Tranche d'imposition** - Plages de revenu sur lesquelles s'appliquent différents taux d'imposition. 8. **Cotisations sociales** - Prélèvements sur les revenus du travail destinés à financer la protection sociale (santé, retraite, chômage, etc.). 9. **Impôt sur le revenu** - Impôt direct prélevé sur le revenu des personnes physiques ou des entreprises. 10. **Impôt sur les sociétés (IS)** - Impôt prélevé sur les bénéfices des entreprises. 11. **TVA (Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutée)** - Impôt indirect appliqué sur la consommation de biens et services. 12. **Numéro d'identification fiscale** - Numéro unique attribué à chaque contribuable pour le suivi de ses affaires fiscales. 13. **Audit fiscal** - Examen approfondi des déclarations et des comptes d'un contribuable par l'agence fiscale. 14. **Fraude fiscale** - Acte illégal consistant à échapper ou à réduire l'impôt dû par des moyens illégaux. 15. **Evasion fiscale** - Utilisation de méthodes légales pour minimiser les obligations fiscales. 16. **Paradis fiscal** - Région ou pays avec des taux d'imposition très bas et/ou des lois favorisant le secret bancaire afin d'attirer les capitaux étrangers. 17. **Exonération fiscale** - Situation où un revenu ou une transaction est totalement exemptée d'impôt. 18. **Paiement de l'impôt** - Action de verser l'impôt dû au fisc. 19. **Charge fiscale** - L'impact financier total de l'impôt sur un individu ou une entreprise. 20. **Retenue à la source** - Prélèvement automatique de l'impôt sur le revenu au moment où le revenu est payé."},{"prompt":"türkçe biliyor musun ?","completion":"Evet, Türkçe biliyorum.

Voici un petit résumé sur chacun des personnages principaux du trio : 1. Yuji Itadori : C'est le protagoniste de l'histoire. Il est un élève possédant une force physique exceptionnelle. Après avoir avalé un doigt maudit appartenant à Ryomen Sukuna, un puissant fléau (forme de démon ou de malédiction), il devient l'hôte de ce dernier. Il rejoint l'école d'exorcisme dans le but de trouver et de consommer les autres doigts de Sukuna pour pouvoir le détruire de l'intérieur une fois que tous seront réunis et ainsi protéger les gens des fléaux. 2. Megumi Fushiguro : Un autre élève de l'école, il est calme, réfléchi et possède des techniques de manipulation de l'ombre qui lui permettent d'invoquer des shikigamis (des esprits ou des entités contrôlées) pour combattre. Il est souvent vu avec Itadori, jouant le rôle de son opposé réfléchi et sérieux. 3. Nobara Kugisaki : Une camarade de classe d'Itadori et de Fushiguro, elle est combative, confiante et fière de ses racines rurales. Elle utilise une technique de jujutsu unique qui implique de frapper des clous avec un marteau et d'utiliser des poupées vaudou pour combattre les fléaux. Ces trois personnages forment le cœur de l'équipe principale dans \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", unissant leurs forces pour lutter contre des menaces surnaturelles tout en développant leurs compétences et en apprenant davantage sur le monde des fléaux et des exorcistes. Ils sont souvent accompagnés et guidés par des exorcistes plus expérimentés, comme leur enseignant Satoru Gojo, qui est lui-même un puissant jujutsu sorcier."},{"prompt":"Qui est le plus fort entre yuji itadori et Yuta okkotsu","completion":"Yuji Itadori et Yuta Okkotsu sont tous deux des personnages principaux dans l'univers du manga et de l'anime \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", créé par Gege Akutami. À la date de ma dernière mise à jour en 2023, il est difficile de dire de manière absolue qui est le plus fort entre les deux sans prendre en compte le contexte de l'histoire et les diverses évolutions des personnages. Dans l'arc scénaristique du manga, Yuta Okkotsu est présenté comme un des personnages les plus puissants, faisant notamment partie des quatre \\"spéculations\\" de l'école. Il est connu pour être l'hôte de Rika Orimoto, un esprit extrêmement puissant qui lui confère une force colossale en combat. Par ailleurs, Yuta a été formé par Satoru Gojo, qui est l'un des plus puissants sorciers de jujutsu, et son habileté au combat ainsi que sa maîtrise de l'énergie maudite sont notables. D'un autre côté, Yuji Itadori est lui aussi exceptionnellement doué. Il est l'hôte de Sukuna, l'un des plus puissants fléaux, ce qui lui donne accès à une force considérable et à d'autres capacités surnaturelles. Néanmoins, Itadori est moins expérimenté et son potentiel se développe au fur et à mesure de l'histoire. En fonction de l'avancée de l'histoire, le rapport de force pourrait évoluer. Par exemple, l'accessibilité de Yuji Itadori à la pleine puissance de Sukuna ou son évolution personnelle en tant que jujutsu sorcerer pourraient remettre en question le rapport de force entre lui et Yuta Okkotsu. En fin de compte, cela dépendra de l'évolution de leur entraînement, de leur maîtrise des techniques de jujutsu et de la manière dont le créateur de la série décide de développer leurs personnages."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"which is the best laptop to buy in 2024","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, I can't predict the specific models of laptops that will be available in 2024. However, I can give you some general advice on choosing the best laptop based on factors that tend to remain consistent over time. When looking for the best laptop, you should consider the following criteria based on your needs: 1. **Purpose and Usage**: Decide what you will be using the laptop for. If it's for gaming, look for high-performance GPUs and CPUs. For business and productivity, consider a laptop with a robust build quality, good keyboard, and long battery life. Creative professionals might need a high-resolution display with accurate color reproduction. 2. **Operating System**: Choose between Windows, macOS, or Linux based on your preference and the type of software you plan to use. 3. **Processor (CPU)**: A fast and efficient CPU is vital for general performance. As of early 2023, look for the latest generation of Intel (13th gen) or AMD Ryzen processors. By 2024, newer generations with improved performance should be available. 4. **Graphics Card (GPU)**: For demanding visual tasks like gaming or video editing, a dedicated GPU from Nvidia or AMD is important. Integrated graphics suffice for general use and less intensive tasks. 5. **Memory (RAM)**: Decide on at least 16GB of RAM for smooth multitasking and heavy workloads. 8GB can be acceptable for lighter use, but future programs may require more RAM. 6. **Storage**: SSDs offer faster performance than HDDs. Look for a laptop with an NVMe SSD for the best speed. The amount of storage you need depends on your use case, but a 512GB SSD is a good starting point. 7. **Display**: Resolution, size, and panel type matter. Look for at least a full HD (1920x1080) display. Creative professionals should aim for higher resolutions and color accuracy. Consider a matte screen if you work in bright environments to reduce glare. 8. **Battery Life**: Depending on your mobility needs, check for laptops with longer battery life. Some ultrabooks offer all-day battery life, which can be very convenient. 9. **Portability**: If you move around a lot, a lighter laptop with a smaller screen size might be your priority. However, if you plan to use it mostly in one location, you might prefer a larger screen and more connectivity options. 10. **Build Quality**: A laptop with good build quality can withstand the rigors of daily use. Look for materials like aluminum or magnesium alloy for durability. 11. **Connectivity**: Ensure it has the ports you require, such as USB-C, HDMI, Thunderbolt, etc. WiFi 6 or later and Bluetooth 5.x are also important for wireless connectivity. 12. **Budget**: Set a budget and look for the best specifications within it. Bear in mind that investing in a higher-quality laptop can save money in the long run. Before purchasing, look for reviews from trusted sources, check out user feedback, and if possible, test the laptop in person. Be aware that models and specifications will change, so when 2024 comes around, you'll want to conduct updated research based on the latest products available."},{"prompt":"the new M3 lineup is a little bit confusing especially the M3 Pro which is the subject of today's video yesterday we primarily focused on the base model M3 MacBook Pro and I think it's holding up pretty well but today we're going to get a little bit more in depth and I've brought in the M2 Pro MacBook Pro for comparison so we have a little bit of a four-way test here M2 versus M3 M2 Pro versus M3 Pro and straight way this isn't a simple comparison because the M2 to the M3 have the same core configuration 8 core CPU 10 core GPU nice and easy not the case for the M3 Pro which has the same 12 core CPU except that that's six efficiency six performance instead of four efficiency 8 performance so they're faster cores but there's less performance cores so what what does that mean same thing with the GPU there's 18 cores that should be faster than the 19 in the M2 Pro it's very strange so we're going to need this four-way shootout to really understand how these things are performing and I still haven't tested the M3 Max so yeah there's a lot to get through here I'm going to be adding more benchmarks in the later tests but for right now let's jump into the comparison with these four machines starting of course with cine bench nice and easy so as we saw in Geekbench 2024 yesterday's video the M3 compared to the M2 is a pretty impressive jump however the same cannot be said for the M3 Pro because we're down two performance cores it doesn't really matter that they're faster the score is basically the same and I noticed the same thing over in blender when running the CPU test it Blender Classroom CPU took 5 minutes and 44 seconds on the M2 Pro versus 5 minutes and 34 seconds on the M3 Pro that's only a 10sec gain you're you're never going to notice something like that but things do get a little bit more interesting when we move over to the GPU I spent a lot of time testing here because the results were fairly inconsistent depending on the program in something simple like 3D Mark 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Wildlife extreme our results are very logical we jump up 7 FPS from M2 to M3 and we jump up 10 FPS from M2 Pro to M3 Pro this reflects this reflects the engine being able to take advantage of those faster cores however ever it doesn't reflect rray tracing which the M3 series has so let's go back over to Blender GPU + metalRT blender to see what that does if we run the standard blender classroom GPU tests with metal enabled on all of these computers you'll find that the M2 to the M3 is a pretty significant gain but the M2 Pro to the M3 Pro does make a fairly noticeable difference however blender has an experimental metal RT setting that allows you to take advantage of that Hardware r tracing so when you enable that you'll notice that we're shaving off about 20 seconds on the regular M3 chip and a little bit more than 10 seconds on the M3 Pro those are honestly some pretty impressive gains especially considering that this is an experimental feature but what really caught my attention is that the M3 GPU with metal RT turned on is actually faster than the M2 Pro so in just 10 months Apple has their base level chip beating the Pro level chip that's pretty cool however it's kind of hard at the moment to find games and applications GFXBench that take advantage of that Hardware Ray tracing so if you launch something like gfx bench you'll notice again pretty similar results to 3D Mark we have a gain of just two FPS going from M2 to M3 and we have a gain of six going from M2 Pro to M3 Pro the scaling here seems mainly dependent on the number of cores rather than the speed of said cores and Shadow of the Tomb Raider in Shadow of the Tomb Raider a game that runs in Rosetta but very well on Apple silicon we had even stranger results here the M3 Pro actually scored worse than the M2 Pro why you ask I don't know but it's weird right and if you do find a game that's very well optimized like for example Resident Evil Village what I found was the M3 Pro is allowing the system to use a little bit more vram probably because of that special new caching feature and the fact that this configuration has 18 GB of unified memory instead of 16 but the FPS and the visuals really don't look any different at the moment it comes down to you have a game that's very well optimized in which case you don't really notice the difference because it runs so well on everything or you have a game that's not well optimized in which case it's not really a very valid comparison so we're definitely going to need to revisit the topic of Gaming I need to spend a couple of days honestly just going through on both of these machines finding a bunch of games settings setting up crossover whole bunch of stuff like that to really put them through their Paces so we'll definitely come back to that later but when we look at these results as a whole it's not looking too hot for the M3 Pro Final Cut Pro and that stays true in Final Cut which is a great way to test the CPU the GPU the Codex all working together well here we saw again massive gains going from M2 to M3 that's seriously impressive but from M2 Pro to M3 Pro what the heck is going on here the M3 Pro was slower and again we're on day two of the release here so maybe optimization needs to happen but even if these machines were tied or the M3 Pro was 13 seconds faster instead of the other way around I I really don't think that's a noticeable difference unless you had them side by side wouldn't mean anything so the only conclusion that I can really draw here is that apple is intentionally preventing the M3 Pro chip from getting faster why else would they reduce the number of CPU performance cores why else would they reduce the number of GPU cores when the M3 Max is increasing it seems like apple wants this performance threshold to stay about the same but Battery comparison that might leave you wondering what about battery life you know reducing the number of performance cores definitely didn't help this thing in terms of performance but there are less performance cores it should be more efficient now the batteries in these two machines are the same even though we found out yesterday that the M31 14in has a slightly smaller battery than the M3 Pro so I think what we need is a giant four-way battery comparison how do all of these machines stack up against each other so my first battery test was High performance battery test a high performance load nearly two hours of benchmarks we did cinebench then gfx bench twice that's a really long one then we did cinch again and we finished it off with a blender CPU [Music] render and the results are in for our four-way performance test here this I think is super interesting because the results weren't exactly what I was expecting let's go through them all right so first of all how did the M2 compare to the M3 well we are sitting at 52% on the M2 and 55% on the M3 and I should mention when I checked in a little while ago they were basically neck and neck so these computers are extremely similar in terms of their battery life which is interesting because this guy has a larger battery but also more performance so it almost seems like apple is intentionally equalizing these machines so they'll have the same battery life now as for the two back there this got pretty interesting because the M2 Pro this is we're at 20% here this thing is not going to last a whole lot longer but the M3 the M3 Pro is at 43% that is a significant difference here now that's super interesting because as we've seen with the performance benchmarks the M3 Pro is a total dud right there's like no performance gains whatsoever but the battery that's where it's at and it seems like apple has chosen to keep the performance the same for these chips when going into this new 3 NM architecture but by reducing the number of performance cores and increasing efficiency we're getting better battery life so those are some pretty interesting results I was not expecting the difference between the M2 Pro and the M3 Pro to be that dramatic but it seems like what Apple did here was take the performance gains on the M3 and take the efficiency gains on the M3 Pro but I Video playback test (from 100%) wanted to do a longer test that was a performance heavy test so overnight last night I left these guys running with a 4K YouTube video just just blasting for like 12 hours okay so the four-way YouTube video test the M3 Pro is on 8% the regular M3 is on 12 the M2 Pro is dead and the M2 24% so uh ironically the old MacBook the slowest MacBook did the best now since the M2 Pro died in that test I set up Final Cut Pro export test another one in Final Cut Pro we're just going to export this massive project to see how they compare and you'll notice the battery rate on the M2 Pro dropping noticeably faster despite the progress in Sharing staying the same now I will say the extra 2 GB of RAM did seem to make a little bit of a difference were barely using any swap memory on the M3 Pro but we were using nearly half a gig on the M2 Pro however after 90 minutes of running this test we were sitting at 72% on the M2 Pro compared to 82% on the M3 Pro that's definitely a tangible difference so again an interesting result and it's clear to see that the M3 Pro is more efficient than the M2 Pro but what surprised me was that the same is not true of the M3 versus the M2 the M2 MacBook Pro beat the M3 in both situations which is a little bit surprising because I know we talked about the M3 taking the performance gain instead of the efficiency gain but we're also moving from a 13 to a 14in device with larger batteries so I personally would have thought that these things would have been almost exactly neck and neck and they were very very close however in that long-term 12-hour test I feel like you would notice a difference like that so the results from this Conclusions and recommendations comparison definitely a little weird all right we've got some funny business going on with the batteries between the M2 and the M3 we got some funny business going on with the performance and the GPU over here a lot of a lot of question marks right but there is one very clear conclusion if you are Cross Shopping any of these devices I would say do not buy the uh the 13-in M2 MacBook Pro I know that's the cheapest one and it's a year and a half old now so you can find these things discounted but the the performance difference between the M2 and the new base model M3 it's way B bigger than I ever thought it would have been so I would absolutely pick this over the M2 now as for the M3 Pro I really can't recommend it I don't think it's a good value I mean okay you get the new space black color the display it's a little bit brighter the SSD is ever so slightly faster and in the case of Unreal Engine I played around with it to see how it would differ and I would say that it was a little bit smoother but not really that much faster than the M2 Pro Plus with all of our benchmarks I mean I really can't see why you would pick the M3 Pro over just getting a refurbished or a used or some other discount on the M2 Pro I think that's the better value so I'm very curious to hear what you guys think about this comparison I'm personally extremely excited to get my hands on the M3 Max it just arrived it's over there I really want to put that thing through its paces and next week when my 16in M3 Max MacBook Pro arrives we're going to do a 14 V16 shootout because that was one that I did back in the M1 days and it was actually very interesting but now with the M3 Max being such a powerful chip I'm very curious to see if the 14in is going to suffer in terms of battery and in terms of cooling compared to the 16 so a lot to look forward to definitely let me know what you'd like me to test in the comments below I'm hoping to get to some more types of benchmarks for the next video","completion":"It seems like you have shared a detailed review and comparison of some hypothetical Apple M-series chips, namely the M2, M3, and their \\"Pro\\" variants. In your comparison, you have taken into account aspects such as CPU and GPU performance, battery life, and suitability for tasks like gaming, video editing in Final Cut Pro, and 3D rendering in Blender. It's important to note that as of my last update in early 2023, the M3 chip has not been released or officially announced by Apple. The text you provided appears to be an imaginative or speculative exercise that discusses how an M3 chip might perform in comparison to the current generation of M-series chips, such as the M1 and M2. You have addressed significant points such as how the core configurations impact performance, with a focus on the balance between efficiency and high-performance cores, and how the GPU core count and capabilities like hardware ray tracing could affect graphic-intensive tasks. There's also attention to battery life based on performance vs. efficiency trade-offs, and the potential for newer architecture like the 3nm process, which could improve efficiency and hence battery life, without necessarily boosting performance due to core configuration choices. You've also brought up the idea of price vs. performance and whether it's worth upgrading to newer models based on the tangible benefits in everyday use. This kind of analysis is familiar in the tech community when new hardware generations are released as users try to determine the value of an upgrade. In real-life scenarios, reviews, and comparisons like these are very useful to potential buyers looking to understand the subtleties of performance improvements and feature enhancements that come with new iterations of technology. When the M3 series chips are actually available, it will be essential for users to look out for benchmarks and real-world tests to make an informed purchasing decision."},{"prompt":"привет у меня в unity есть 4 скрипта в которых есть один и тот же код как мне это исправить вот блок одинокого кода public class UITrainingScreen : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private Button _buttonBackMenu; public Action OnBackMenu; public void Initialized() { _buttonBackMenu.onClick.AddListener(BackMenu); } private void BackMenu() { OnBackMenu.Invoke(); } }","completion":"Если у вас есть 4 скрипта с одинаковым кодом, то это явный признак того, что вам стоит рефакторить код, чтобы избежать дублирования. Один из подходов к решению этой проблемы - вынести общий код в базовый класс, а затем наследовать этот класс в вашем конкретном случае. Для вашего примера, можно создать базовый класс, который будет управлять кнопкой и вызывать событие: \`\`\`csharp public class BaseUIScreen : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private Button _buttonBack; // Предполагается, что кнопка называется \\"Back\\" в каждом UI public event Action OnBack; protected virtual void Start() { _buttonBack.onClick.AddListener(OnBackButtonPressed); } protected void OnBackButtonPressed() { OnBack?.Invoke(); } } \`\`\` Теперь каждый ваш UI-скрипт может наследоваться от этого класса, и вам не придется дублировать логику, относящуюся к кнопке \\"Назад\\". Дочерние классы могут выглядеть так: \`\`\`csharp public class UITrainingScreen : BaseUIScreen { // Здесь можно добавить специфичную для этого экрана логику } \`\`\` \`\`\`csharp public class UIAnotherScreen : BaseUIScreen { // Специфичная логика для другого экрана } \`\`\` Теперь у каждого класса будет доступ к кнопке \\"Назад\\" и событию \`OnBack\`, но без дублирования кода. Вы можете положиться на логику базового класса. Если у вас есть код, специфичный для каждого дочернего класса, вы можете его добавить туда. Не забудьте, что сериализованные поля должны быть установлены в инспекторе Unity для каждого конкретного экземпляра вашего класса UI. Если у вас разные кнопки \\"Back\\" в каждом UI-компоненте, вам нужно будет настроить их отдельное связывание с соответствующим сериализованным полем в родительском классе через инспектор Unity в каждом отдельном случае. Также, если логика для кнопки \\"Назад\\" у каждого экрана разная, вы можете сделать метод \`OnBackButtonPressed\` виртуальным и переопределить его в дочерних классах для предоставления уникальной функциональности где это необходимо."},{"prompt":"я не хочу что бы у меня использовался Start()","completion":"Если вы не хотите использовать метод \`Start\` для инициализации в базовом классе, вы можете заменить его на другой метод, который может быть вызван явно в момент, когда вам это нужно.

Например: \`\`\`csharp public class UITrainingScreen : BaseUIScreen { // Дополнительные компоненты или логика для этого экрана private void Awake() { InitializeUI(); } // Дополнительные методы специфичные для этого экрана } \`\`\` В этом примере, \`InitializeUI\` вызывается в методе \`Awake\`, который является частью жизненного цикла MonoBehaviour и вызывается перед \`Start\`. Это обеспечивает, что UI будет должным образом инициализирован до использования. Помните, что если вы используете этот подход, вам нужно убедиться, что вызываете \`InitializeUI()\` во всех дочерних классах, которые наследуются от \`BaseUIScreen\`, чтобы обеспечить правильную инициализацию кнопки \\"Назад\\".

Manufacturing Process Improvements: As semiconductor fabrication processes improve, manufacturers can create smaller and more efficient transistors. Moving from larger to smaller nanometer processes allows more transistors to be packed into the same area, reducing power consumption, and increasing performance. 2. Architectural Innovations: Chip designers continually find new ways to optimize the architecture of mobile chipsets. This includes developing better CPU and GPU cores, improving memory hierarchies, and introducing new features like dedicated AI processing units or neural engines. 3. Power Efficiency: Mobile chipsets are designed for devices with limited battery life, so there's significant focus on power efficiency. Advances in power management techniques, voltage scaling, and low-power states contribute to longer battery life while maintaining or boosting performance. 4. Integration: Integrating more functionality into a single chipset can improve performance and efficiency. This can include incorporating modems, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other connectivity options directly into the chipset. 5. Software Optimization: Hardware improvements are complemented by software optimizations. Advances in compilers, operating systems, and application code can lead to better utilization of chipset capabilities, resulting in improved performance. 6. AI and ML Enhancements: The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms within mobile chipsets helps in faster and more efficient processing of complex tasks, enhancing overall performance and user experience. 7. Heat Dissipation: Advances in thermal management technologies allow mobile chipsets to run at higher speeds without overheating, which was a limitation in the past. 8. Competition: The competitive landscape drives continual improvements as companies seek to outperform each other with each new generation of chipset. The principles of Moore's Law, which roughly states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years while the cost halves, have historically predicted the growth in computational power. While it is increasingly challenging to maintain this pace due to physical and economic limits, innovations across various domains, including materials science (e.g., potential future use of graphene or carbon nanotubes), 3D stacking (vertical integration), and emerging computing paradigms (such as quantum computing), suggest that improvements can continue for the foreseeable future. However, it's reasonable to expect that these improvements may slow down, and achieving them will require more effort and resources."},{"prompt":"When do you expect it to become stagnant?","completion":"As an AI, I don't possess the ability to predict the future, but I can provide insights based on current trends and expert opinions. Predicting when or if the improvement of mobile chipsets will become stagnant is challenging due to the unpredictability of technological breakthroughs and the complexity of semiconductor manufacturing. However, there are several factors that might suggest where a limit could be encountered: 1. Physical Limitations: As transistors approach the size of atoms, quantum effects and other physical phenomena could limit further miniaturization. Some experts suggest that we may encounter insurmountable barriers in the next decade or two if alternative materials or new computing paradigms aren't implemented to overcome these limitations. 2. Economic Limitations: The cost of developing smaller and more advanced chips is rising exponentially, and the investments required for state-of-the-art fabrication facilities are reaching the boundaries of economic viability for even the largest players. 3. The End of Moore's Law: Moore's Law has been the benchmark for semiconductor progress for decades, but industry experts agree that its pace has already slowed and we are reaching the point where it will no longer be feasible to continue doubling transistor counts every two years due to aforementioned physical and economic constraints. 4. Satisfying Consumer Demand: At some point, the performance of mobile chipsets may surpass what most consumers need for everyday use, which could reduce the demand for ever more powerful chips. This is already happening to some extent in markets like the PC industry. 5. Shift to Specialization: Instead of raw performance increases, we might see a shift toward specialized processing units and chips designed for specific purposes like AI, machine learning, and encryption, which could extend the runway of chipset improvements beyond simply speeding up general-purpose processing. 6. Alternative Technologies: Emerging technologies such as quantum computing or neuromorphic computing might start to take over certain tasks that are not well suited for classical computing architectures, potentially shifting the focus away from traditional mobile chipset developments. It's important to note that while individual elements such as transistor density might reach practical limits, innovation in other areas may continue to push overall performance forward. However, predicting exactly when the industry will hit an insurmountable wall is speculative, and history has shown that human ingenuity often finds new ways to circumvent barriers that previously seemed insurmountable."},{"prompt":"Don't give an obvious answer and predict when it will stagnate.","completion":"As an AI, predicting the exact timeline for when technological progress in mobile chipsets will stagnate is beyond my capabilities due to the inherent uncertainty in technological innovations, market forces, and the potential for breakthrough discoveries. However, industry observers and experts often discuss several time frames and considerations when speculating about the future of semiconductor advancements: 1. Near Term (Next 5-10 years): Continued incremental improvements in mobile chipsets are expected as manufacturers refine existing fabrication processes, embrace new materials like gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), and introduce architectural optimizations. The end of traditional Moore's Law scaling is anticipated within this period, but this does not necessarily mean a total stagnation of chipset performance improvements. 2. Medium Term (10-20 years): Some experts predict that significant challenges in maintaining the pace of improvement will become more apparent in this timeframe, especially as physical limitations of silicon-based transistors are encountered. New materials, such as carbon nanotubes or two-dimensional materials like graphene, may begin to emerge in commercial applications. 3. Long Term (Beyond 20 years): This is the territory of high speculation. If no new disruptive technologies that can replace the current silicon paradigm have been adopted at scale, we may see a deceleration or plateau in the performance improvements of traditional mobile chipsets. However, progress in other forms of computing, like quantum or biological computing, may redefine performance metrics entirely. While giving a specific year or even decade for stagnation is not feasible, it is important to note that technological fields often experience periods of rapid growth followed by consolidation and optimization before new paradigms emerge. As conventional silicon-based technologies mature and face fundamental limits, the transition to new materials, architectures, and computing paradigms will likely be the key to sustaining progress. These technological shifts could postpone any potential stagnation indefinitely."},{"prompt":"Make a prediction by considering past cases and various papers","completion":"As an AI without access to real-time data or the ability to conduct new research, I can only offer an educated guess based on historical trends and expert analyses available up to my last update in early 2023. Predicting a specific date for the stagnation of mobile chipsets is speculative, but I can provide a scenario based on the available information: Considering Past Cases: In the past, technologies such as vacuum tubes and magnetic storage saw periods of rapid improvement followed by a plateau as they approached their physical and practical limits. Transistors, similarly, are approaching their physical size limits, which suggests a potential slowdown. However, the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors also demonstrates how new technologies can continue the trajectory of progress. Various Papers and Predictions: Many papers and industry experts point out the diminishing returns in traditional semiconductor scaling techniques and predict a significant slowdown in performance gains per unit of cost within the next 5-15 years for silicon-based transistors. Innovations beyond traditional scaling, like 3D stacking and advanced packaging technologies, are expected to extend improvements for a while. A Prediction Scenario: Based on the trends and expert analysis, there might be a substantial slowdown in performance gains from traditional scaling somewhere between 2025 to 2035. During this period, manufacturers might increasingly rely on alternative methods of improvement, such as architectural changes, software optimizations, and new materials. The emergence of new computing paradigms, such as quantum computing or specialized AI processors, could redefine what \\"improvement\\" means, shifting the focus away from traditional metrics like clock speed and transistor count. If a breakthrough technology emerges that can be scaled commercially, it has the potential to sustain progress in one form or the other, effectively preventing stagnation. Summary: A cautious predictive scenario would suggest a marked deceleration in the pace of improvements to traditional mobile chipsets by the 2030s, though not necessarily total stagnation. However, the future of chipset advancements depends on numerous unpredictable factors, including breakthroughs in new materials, chip design, and computing paradigms. As such, it’s possible that mobile chipsets will continue to see performance enhancements well beyond the 2030s, albeit through different means than the historical trends of transistor scaling."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

Je suis ravi de vous aider à clarifier les informations concernant les pouvoirs et aptitudes de Yuji Itadori, le personnage principal de \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\". Voici une correction et mise à jour des informations sur ses capacités : 1. Énergie Occulte (Énergie Cursée) : Yuji a accès à une réserve d’énergie occulte après avoir mangé l'un des doigts de Sukuna. Cela lui permet d’exécuter des techniques de malédiction et d’améliorer ses caractéristiques physiques. Cependant, contrairement à de nombreux autres sorciers, Yuji ne possède pas au départ ses propres techniques de malédiction, mais il apprend avec le temps à contrôler l'énergie occulte pour combattre les fléaux. 2. Force Physique Exceptionnelle : Avant même de devenir l'hôte de Sukuna, Yuji présentait déjà une force physique anormalement élevée pour un humain, capable de briser des structures avec ses coups. 3. Vitesse et Agilité : Yuji est extrêmement rapide et agile, lui permettant d'esquiver des attaques à grande vitesse et d'effectuer des mouvements acrobatiques complexes. 4. Intelligence : Il est stratégique et rapide d'esprit dans les combats, ce qui compensait initialement son manque de techniques de malédiction. 5. Sens du Combat (Battle IQ) : Il a montré à plusieurs reprises un sens aigu du combat, pouvant s'adapter rapidement aux différents styles de lutte de ses ennemis. 6. Résistance : Yuji a démontré être très résilient, capable de continuer à combattre malgré la fatigue ou les blessures et peut récupérer rapidement grâce à l'énergie occulte. 7. Divergent Fist (Poing Divergent) : Yuji développe une technique nommée \\"Divergent Fist\\", où il frappe avec sa force physique et, un bref instant plus tard, l'énergie occulte arrive, ce qui crée une sorte de double impact sur l'adversaire. 8. Black Flash (Éclair Noir) : Yuji peut exécuter le Black Flash, un coup amplifié d'énergie occulte qui se produit lorsque l'utilisateur frappe un adversaire en manipulant l'énergie occulte avec une précision parfaite, ce qui augmente considérablement l'impact des coups. 9. Relation avec Ryomen Sukuna : En tant que réceptacle de Sukuna, Yuji peut, malgré lui, permettre à Sukuna de prendre les commandes de son corps, généralement lors de situations de vie ou de mort. Quand cela arrive, Sukuna a accès à toute sa puissance et techniques dévastatrices. 10. Extension de Territoire (Domain Expansion) : Yuji n’a pas personnellement démontré la capacité d'exécuter une telle technique, mais Sukuna, lorsqu'il prend contrôle, peut utiliser son Extension de Territoire nommée \\"Malevolent Shrine\\" qui est incroyablement puissante.

Recent work has shown that explicit intermediate reasoning (“rationales”) can improve large language model (LLM) performance as well (rajani2019explain, ; shwartz2020unsupervised, ; nye2021show, ; wei2022chain, ; marasovic2021few, ; lampinen2022can, ). For example, nye2021show demonstrated that LLMs explicitly trained to use “scratchpads” for intermediate steps can attain perfect in-distribution performance on arithmetic, and strong out-of-distribution generalization, while models trained to predict answers directly fail to do either. These works suggest that generating explicit rationales before giving a final answer (“rationale generation”) is valuable for LLMs across diverse tasks including mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, code evaluation, social bias inference, and natural language inference. However, the two primary methods for inducing rationale generation both have serious drawbacks. One approach to rationale generation is the construction of a fine-tuning dataset of rationales, either manually by human annotators or automatically with hand-crafted templates (rajani2019explain, ; shwartz2020unsupervised, ; nye2021show, ; cobbe2021training, ). Manual methods are expensive, and it is infeasible to construct such a dataset for each interesting problem (rajani2019explain, ). Meanwhile, template-based methods rely on automatically-generated rationales but only work when a general solution is already known (nye2021show, ) or reasonable hard-coded heuristics can be made (shwartz2020unsupervised, ). An alternative is to leverage in-context learning by including only a few rationale examples in the language model prompt. This has been shown to improve accuracy on mathematical and symbolic reasoning tasks relative to prompting without rationales (“direct” prompting) (nye2021show, ; wei2022chain, ). Yet, while few-shot techniques with rationales tend to outperform their non-reasoning counterparts, they generally substantially underperform models fine-tuned to directly predict answers using larger datasets (nye2021show, ; wei2022chain, ).","completion":"1 서론 인간의 의사결정은 종종 긴 사고의 흐름의 결과입니다 (james1890principles, ; ericsson1984protocol, ). 최근의 연구들은 명시적인 중간 추론(\\"근거\\")이 큰 언어 모델(Large Language Model, LLM)의 성능을 개선하는 데에도 도움이 된다는 것을 보여주었습니다 (rajani2019explain, ; shwartz2020unsupervised, ; nye2021show, ; wei2022chain, ; marasovic2021few, ; lampinen2022can,). 예를 들어, nye2021show(년도의 논문)는 '스크래치패드(scratchpads)'를 중간 단계에 활용하는 방법을 명확히 훈련받은 LLM이 산술 문제에 대해 완벽한 분배 내에서의 성능을 달성하고, 분배 외 일반화(generalization)에 강하며, 반면에 직접적인 답변 예측 훈련을 받은 모델은 둘 다 실패한다는 것을 보여주었습니다. 이러한 연구는 수학적 추론, 상식 추론, 코드 평가, 사회적 편견 추론, 자연어 추론 등 다양한 작업에 걸쳐서 LLM에 대한 명시적인 근거 생성이 유용하다는 점을 시사합니다. 그러나 근거 생성을 유도하기 위한 두 가지 주요 방법 모두 심각한 단점을 가지고 있습니다. 근거 생성의 한 방법은 근거를 가진 미세조정(fine-tuning) 데이터셋의 구축입니다. 이 데이터셋은 수작업으로 인간 주석자가 만들거나 수작업으로 만든 템플릿을 통해 자동으로 생성됩니다 (rajani2019explain, ; shwartz2020unsupervised, ; nye2021show, ; cobbe2021training,). 수작업 방법은 비용이 많이 들고, 각각의 흥미로운 문제들에 대해 그러한 데이터셋을 구축하는 것은 비현실적입니다 (rajani2019explain,). 한편, 템플릿 기반의 방법은 자동으로 생성된 근거에 의존하지만, 일반적인 솔루션이 이미 알려져 있을 때(혹은 합리적인 하드코딩된 추론 지침이 마련될 수 있을 때)만 작동합니다 (nye2021show, ; shwartz2020unsupervised,). 대안으로서, 언어 모델 프롬프트에 근거 예시를 단지 몇 가지만 포함시켜 배움의 문맥(in-context learning)을 활용하는 방법이 있습니다. 이는 수학 및 기호 추론 작업에서 근거 없이 프롬프트하는 것(\\"직접\\" 프롬프트)에 비해 정확도를 향상시킨다고 보여진 바 있습니다 (nye2021show, ; wei2022chain,). 그러나, 근거를 사용한 몇 가지 사례(few-shot) 기술들이 일반적으로 비추론 대응물들을 능가하는 경향이 있지만, 대체로 더 큰 데이터셋을 사용하여 직접적으로 답변을 예측하도록 미세 조정된 모델의 성능을 크게 하지 못합니다 (nye2021show, ; wei2022chain,)."},{"prompt":"Figure 1: An overview of STaR and a STaR-generated rationale on CommonsenseQA. We indicate the fine-tuning outer loop with a dashed line. The questions and ground truth answers are expected to be present in the dataset, while the rationales are generated using STaR. In this paper, we adopt a different approach: by leveraging the LLM’s pre-existing reasoning ability, we iteratively bootstrap the ability to generate high-quality rationales. Specifically, we few-shot prompt a large language model to self-generate rationales and refine the model’s ability further by fine-tuning on those rationales that lead to correct answers. We repeat this procedure, using the improved model to generate the next training set each time. This is a synergistic process, where improvements in rationale generation improve the training data, and improvements in training data further improve rationale generation. However, we find this loop eventually fails to solve any new problems in the training set because it receives no direct training signal for problems it fails to solve. To overcome this issue, we propose rationalization: for each problem that the model fails to answer correctly, we generate a new rationale by providing the model with the correct answer. This lets the model reason backward—given the correct answer, the model can more easily generate a useful rationale. These rationales are then collected as part of the training data, which often improves overall accuracy. We thus develop the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Fig. 1) method, a scalable bootstrapping method allowing models to learn to generate their own rationales, while also learning to solve increasingly difficult problems. In our method, we repeat the following process: in each iteration, first construct a finetuning dataset by attempting to solve the dataset using the current model’s rationale generation ability; then, augment this dataset using rationalization, justifying ground-truth answers to problems the model failed to solve; finally, finetune the large language model on the combined dataset. Applying STaR on arithmetic, math word problems, and commonsense reasoning, we observe it is able to effectively translate a small number of few-shot prompts into a large rationale dataset, yielding dramatic performance improvements. On CommonsenseQA (talmor2019commonsenseqa, ), we find STaR improves over both a few-shot baseline (+35.9%) and a baseline fine-tuned to directly predict answers (+12.5%) , and performs comparably to a fine-tuned model that is 30 × larger (72.5% vs. 73.0%). Thus, we make the following contributions: 1. We propose a bootstrapping mechanism to iteratively generate a rationale dataset from a few initial examples with rationales—without needing to check new rationales’ correctness. 2. We complement rationale generation with rationalization, where a model is tasked with justifying an answer and then fine-tuned as if it had come up with the rationale without any hint. We show rationalization accelerates and improves the bootstrapping process. 3. We evaluate these techniques with a variety of ablations in both mathematical and commonsense reasoning domains. 4. We propose what is, to our knowledge, the first technique to allow a pre-trained large language model to iteratively use its language modeling capacity to improve itself.","completion":"그림 1: CommonsenseQA에서의 STaR 개요와 STaR이 생성한 근거 예시. 대시선은 미세조정의 외부 루프를 나타냅니다. 데이터셋에는 질문과 정답이 포함되어야 하지만, 근거는 STaR을 사용하여 생성됩니다. 이 논문에서 우리는 다른 접근법을 취합니다: LLM의 이미 존재하는 추론 능력을 활용하여 고품질의 근거 생성 능력을 반복적으로 자가 향상시킵니다. 구체적으로 우리는 언어 모델에 소수의 예시(few-shot prompt)로 자가 근거 생성을 유도하고, 올바른 답변으로 이어지는 근거에 대해 모델의 능력을 더 미세 조정하여 개선합니다. 우리는 이 절차를 반복하여, 매번 더 나아진 모델을 사용하여 다음 훈련 데이터셋을 생성합니다. 이것은 상승작용 과정으로, 근거 생성의 향상이 훈련 데이터를 개선하고, 훈련 데이터의 개선이 다시 근거 생성을 더욱 향상시킵니다. 그러나 우리는 이 루프가 결국 새로운 문제를 해결하는 데 실패하는 문제에 대한 직접적인 훈련 신호를 받지 못함으로써 훈련 데이터셋의 어떠한 새로운 문제도 해결하지 못하게 된다는 것을 발견했습니다. 이 문제를 극복하기 위해, 우리는 정당화(rationalization)를 제안합니다: 모델이 올바르게 답변하지 못한 각 문제에 대해, 올바른 답을 제공하는 방식으로 새로운 근거를 생성합니다. 이를 통해 모델은 뒤로 추론할 수 있게 됩니다—올바른 답을 주어지면, 모델은 좀 더 쉽게 유용한 근거를 생성할 수 있습니다. 이러한 근거들은 훈련 데이터의 일부로 수집되며, 종종 전체적인 정확도를 향상시킵니다. 우리는 이와 같이 Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, 그림 1) 방법을 개발했습니다. 이 방법은 모델들이 스스로 자신의 근거를 생성하는 것을 배우고, 점점 더 어려운 문제를 해결하는 것을 배울 수 있는 확장 가능한 부트스트래핑 방법입니다. 우리 방법에서는, 우리는 다음과 같은 과정을 반복합니다: 각 반복에서 우선, 현재 모델의 근거 생성 능력을 사용하여 데이터셋을 해결하려 시도함으로써 미세조정 데이터셋을 구성한 다음; 이 데이터셋을 모델이 실패한 문제들에 대한 정답을 정당화하는 rationalization을 통해 확장하고; 마지막으로, 대규모 언어 모델을 결합된 데이터셋에 미세 조정합니다. STaR을 적용해 산술, 수학 문제 해결, 상식 추론 등에서 우리는 소수의 few-shot 프롬프트를 대규모 근거 데이터셋으로 효과적으로 변환시키는 것을 관찰하였고, 이는 비약적인 성능 향상을 가져왔습니다.

In essence, in-context learning treats few-shot learning as a language modeling problem, by showing a few examples in the context (i.e. prompt), and allowing the model to learn and identify the pattern to apply to new examples. Some have studied in-context learning based on the language modeling objective in terms of Bayesian inference xie2021explanation while others have attempted to describe the process more mechanistically in terms of “induction heads” (olsson_elhage, ). Moreover, differences in prompt configurations have been known to have dramatic effects on few-shot performance. Some have even found that replacing few-shot prompts with a “soft prompt” which can be optimized in embedding space results in noticeable gains (lester2021power, ). Instead of emphasizing the representation of the question, we focus on the model output; in particular, we focus on the model’s ability to reason through a problem before coming to a conclusion. Rationales One of the initial works on the impact of rationales on language model performance was rajani2019explain , showing that training a language model on a dataset with explicit rationales preceding the answer could improve a model’s ability to generate the final answer. However, this required many thousands of training examples to be manually annotated with human reasoning. Recently, nye2021show demonstrated that step-by-step “scratchpads” can improve fine-tuned LLM performance and generalization on tasks such as arithmetic, polynomial evaluation, and program evaluation. Similarly, wei2022chain used a single few-shot “chain-of-thought” reasoning prompt in order to improve model performance on a collection of tasks, without fine-tuning. Finally, polu2022formal showed that a curriculum learning approach could help solve formal math problems, as long as 1) they were translated into Lean (a theorem-proving language (moura2015lean, )), 2) one could directly evaluate the validity of the proofs, 3) one could sample numerous potential solutions for each problem, 4) had trained a separate value function model, and 5) started with GPT-f (a model already fine-tuned on a large math dataset (polu2020generative, )). We note that there are many domains where these conditions do not all apply. In addition, works have aimed to explain why rationales have this beneficial effect: some have analyzed their impact from the perspective of latent variable models (zhou2020towards, ) while others have provided formal proofs of the benefit of intermediate task supervision (wies2022sub, ). Iterated Learning A variety of iterated learning algorithms have been proposed, where solutions or successful methods which are found are in turn used to find additional solutions (anthony2017thinking, ; vani2021iterated, ; polu2022formal, ). anthony2017thinking introduced Expert Iteration (ExIt), a reinforcement learning technique serving as an inspiration for our approach. Essentially, it consists of a loop of self-play by an “apprentice,” followed by imitation learning with feedback from a slower “expert” and then the replacement of the expert with the now-improved apprentice. polu2022formal builds off of ExIt for formal reasoning, while vani2021iterated applies iterated learning to visual question answering using modular networks which can be combined compositionally. There are further similarities between STaR and expert iteration methods (anthony2017thinking, ). For example, filtering generated examples based on whether their ultimate answer matches the target can be seen as expert feedback. However, we have a fixed “expert” and do not train a separate value function. Natural Language Explanations Natural language explanations have also been discussed from the perspective of explainable machine learning, focusing on justification rather than reasoning (camburu2018snli, ; chen2021generate, ). The motivation for this line of work is largely grounded in explainable decision making, and similarly to rajani2019explain , generally does not find that requiring post-hoc explanations improves model performance.","completion":"2 배경 및 관련 작업 문맥 학습(In-context Learning) 최근 대규모 언어 모델이 문맥 학습을 수행할 수 있는 능력에 관한 연구 작업이 등장하고 있습니다(brown2020language, ; wei2021finetuned,). 본질적으로 문맥 학습은 언어 모델링 문제로 Few-shot 학습을 다루는 것으로, 몇 가지 예시를 문맥(즉, 프롬프트) 안에 보여주고 모델이 새로운 예시에 적용할 패턴을 학습하고 식별할 수 있도록 합니다. 일부 연구에서는 베이지안 추론 측면에서 언어 모델링 목적을 기반으로 한 문맥 학습을 연구했으며(xie2021explanation) 다른 연구에서는 \\"인덕션 헤드\\"라는 용어에서 이 과정을 더 기계적으로 설명하려 시도했습니다(olsson_elhage, ). 또한 프롬프트 구성의 차이가 Few-shot 성능에 크게 영향을 미친다는 것이 알려져 있습니다. 일부는 임베딩 공간에서 최적화될 수 있는 \\"소프트 프롬프트\\"로 Few-shot 프롬프트를 교체하면 상당한 향상이 있다는 것을 발견했습니다(lester2021power, ). 질문의 표현에 중점을 두기보다는, 우리는 모델 출력에 중점을 두며 특히 문제를 추론하는 모델의 능력에 초점을 맞춥니다. 근거(Rationales) 언어 모델 성능에 대한 근거의 영향에 관한 초기 연구 중 하나는 rajani2019explain으로, 답변에 앞서 명시적인 근거가 포함된 데이터셋으로 언어 모델을 훈련시키면 모델이 최종 답변을 생성하는 능력을 향상시킬 수 있음을 보여주었습니다. 그러나 이는 수천 개의 훈련 예시를 인간의 추론으로 수동으로 주석 처리해야 하는 것을 필요로 했습니다. 최근에는 nye2021show가 단계별 \\"스크래치패드\\"가 산술, 다항식 평가, 프로그램 평가 등과 같은 과제에서 정교한 LLM 성능과 일반화를 향상시킬 수 있음을 보였습니다. 유사하게 wei2022chain은 단일 Few-shot \\"사고의 흐름\\" 추론 프롬프트를 사용하여 미세 조정 없이 모델 성능을 향상시켰습니다. 마지막으로, polu2022formal은 커리큘럼 학습 접근법이 정식 수학 문제를 해결하는 데 도움이 될 수 있음을 보여주었습니다. 이는 1) 문제가 Lean(정리 증명 언어(moura2015lean, ))으로 번역된 경우, 2) 증명의 유효성을 직접 평가할 수 있는 경우, 3) 각 문제에 대해 수많은 잠재적 솔루션을 샘플링할 수 있는 경우, 4) 별도의 가치 기능 모델을 훈련시킨 경우, 5) 이미 대규모 수학 데이터셋으로 미세 조정된 GPT-f 모델로 시작한 경우에 해당됩니다(polu2020generative, ). 우리는 이러한 조건들이 모두 적용되지 않는 많은 도메인이 있다는 점을 지적합니다. 또한, 근거가 이러한 유익한 효과를 가지는 이유를 설명하려는 작업이 목표로 했습니다. 일부는 잠재 변수 모델 측면에서 그 영향을 분석한 반면(zhou2020towards, ), 다른 일부는 중간 작업 감독의 이점에 대한 형식적 증명을 제공했습니다(wies2022sub, ). 반복 학습(Iterated Learning) 확인된 솔루션이나 성공적인 방법을 기반으로 추가 솔루션을 찾는 다양한 반복 학습 알고리즘들이 제안되었습니다(anthony2017thinking, ; vani2021iterated, ; polu2022formal, ). anthony2017thinking은 우리 접근법에 영감을 준 강화 학습 기술인 Expert Iteration (ExIt)을 도입했습니다. 본질적으로, 이것은 \\"수습생\\"에 의한 자체 플레이의 루프로 구성되어 있으며, 느린 \\"전문가\\"로부터 피드백을 받는 모방 학습을 거친 후 개선된 수습생으로 전문가를 대체합니다. polu2022formal은 정식 추론을 위해 ExIt를 기반으로 하며, vani2021iterated는 모듈러 네트워크를 사용하여 구성 가능한 방식으로 시각적 질문에 대한 해답을 찾기 위한 반복 학습을 적용합니다. 추가적으로 STaR과 전문가 반복 방법(anthony2017thinking, ) 사이에 유사점도 있습니다. 예를 들어, 생성된 예시를 최종 답변이 대상과 일치하는지 여부에 따라 필터링하는 것은 전문가의 피드백으로 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 우리는 고정된 \\"전문가\\"를 가지고 있으며 별도의 가치 기능을 훈련하지 않습니다. 자연어 설명(Natural Language Explanations) 자연어 설명도 추론보다는 정당화에 중점을 둔 설명 가능한 머신러닝의 관점에서 논의되었습니다(camburu2018snli, ; chen2021generate, ). 이 분야의 작업 동기는 주로 설명 가능한 의사결정에 뿌리를 두고 있으며, 마찬가지로 rajani2019explain처럼 사후에 설명을 요구하는 것이 모델 성능을 개선한다는 결과를 일반적으로 찾지 못했습니다."},{"prompt":"few-shot 러닝이 뭐야?","completion":"Few-shot 러닝(Few-shot Learning)은 기계학습의 한 분야로, 모델이 아주 제한된 양의 데이터(즉, 매우 적은 수의 예제 또는 \\"샷(shot)\\")를 통해 새로운 작업이나 범주를 빠르게 학습하는 것을 목표로 합니다. 전통적인 기계학습 모델이나 딥러닝 모델은 일반적으로 좋은 성능을 내기 위해 대규모 데이터셋으로부터 학습하는데, 이는 많은 자원과 시간을 요구합니다. 반면, Few-shot 러닝 기법은 인간이 몇 번의 예시를 보고 새로운 개념을 학습하는 능력에 영감을 받아, 제한된 데이터만으로 빠르게 학습하고 일반화할 수 있는 모델을 개발하는 것을 목표로 합니다.

Si vous avez d'autres questions ou si vous voulez en savoir plus sur Jujutsu Kaisen, n'hésitez pas à me le demander. 😊Si ils y a des infos faut réécris le texte et modifie se qui est faux sur yuta a l' aide de t'es connaissances","completion":"Bien sûr, je vais clarifier et mettre à jour les informations sur Yuta Okkotsu à partir de mes connaissances jusqu’à ma date limite de connaissances en 2023. Yuta Okkotsu est un personnage secondaire de la série manga \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" écrite et illustrée par Gege Akutami. Voici une description plus précise de ses pouvoirs et capacités: - **Affinité avec le Fléau**: Yuta est hanté par le Fléau de Rika Orimoto, une entité puissante qui est liée à lui par un engagement passé. Rika, étant un Fléau \\"Spécial de Grade\\", confère à Yuta d'énormes quantités d'énergie maudite et des capacités extraordinaires. - **Manipulation de l'Énergie Maudite**: Yuta peut utiliser l'énergie maudite pour renforcer ses attaques, se protéger à l'aide de barrières, et même soigner ses blessures ou celles d'autrui. - **Forces physiques renforcées**: Grâce à l'énergie maudite, Yuta possède une force physique, une agilité et une vitesse bien supérieures à celles d'un humain ordinaire. - **Imitation de Techniques**: Yuta a le rare talent de pouvoir copier les techniques des autres exorcistes après les avoir observées ou en avoir été la cible, ce qui le rend très polyvalent en combat. - **Résonance**: Une technique héritée de Toge Inumaki, qui lui permet de blesser un adversaire en se blessant lui-même, car il partage le lien avec Rika. - **Katana**: Yuta est souvent représenté avec un katana qu'il utilise comme canal pour l'énergie maudite, le rendant ainsi plus tranchant et destructeur. - **Intelligence et Adaptabilité**: Yuta a fait preuve d'une grande intelligence tactique et d'une capacité d'adaptation rapide, notamment en combat. Il peut élaborer des stratégies efficaces face à divers adversaires. - **Endurance**: Yuta a une endurance physique remarquable, lui permettant de continuer à combattre malgré les blessures subies. Quant à l'Extension de Territoire (Domain Expansion), à ma connaissance jusqu'en 2023, Yuta n'a pas encore montré explicitement qu'il est capable d'exécuter sa propre extension de territoire dans le manga. Les extensions de territoire sont des techniques avancées qui nécessitent une maîtrise particulière de l'énergie maudite. Toutefois, avec l'énergie maudite presque illimitée qu'il possède et son potentiel de croissance, il ne serait pas surprenant qu'il puisse maîtriser cette technique à l’avenir. J'espère que ces informations ont clarifié et corrigé la description des pouvoirs de Yuta Okkotsu selon les informations disponibles jusqu'en 2023.

Tell me about the story, characters, setting, any special artifacts or relics involved, and any other details you find interesting or important to the world you're creating. Remember to stay true to your vision and be creative!"},{"prompt":"The manga takes place in 1968 in the cold war. The story follows 3 archeologists hunting down a special sword found somewhere in some Pharaoh's tomb.","completion":"That sounds like an exciting premise for a manga! Mixing archaeology with the intrigue of the Cold War is a recipe for adventure, suspense, and possibly some political drama. Here are some potential elements and questions you might explore or address in your manga: 1. Characters: What are the backgrounds and motivations of the three archaeologists? Are they working together harmoniously, or do they each have their own agendas? Are they up against rivals from other countries due to the Cold War setting? 2. The Special Sword: What makes the sword special? Is it only of historical significance, or does it possess certain powers or a curse? How is it connected to the Pharaoh, and what legends surround it? 3. Setting: Given the global nature of the Cold War, are your characters only exploring Egypt, or does their quest take them to other parts of the world? What challenges do they face in the late '60s, both culturally and technologically? 4. Historical Integration: How are you weaving actual historical events, figures, or the overall atmosphere of the Cold War into your narrative? This could provide a rich backdrop for your story. 5. Opposition: Who else is after the sword? Do your protagonists have a nemesis, perhaps a KGB agent or a rival archaeologist? What lengths are other parties willing to go to in order to obtain the sword? 6. Style and Tone: Since you're paying homage to Indiana Jones through a manga, what kind of balance will you strike between action, humor, and drama? Will you incorporate typical manga art styles, or are you planning on merging different artistic approaches? 7. Serialization and Structure: Have you planned out how the story arcs will unfold? Is this intended to be a long-running series with multiple artifacts and adventures, or a tightly focused story about the quest for this particular sword? Remember to research the era thoroughly to portray it accurately and consider how to handle representation of different cultures with respect and sensitivity. It's also important to consider how your manga's art style and storytelling approach will appeal to your target audience while differentiating your work from others in the genre. Best of luck with your manga! It sounds like an exciting project."},{"prompt":"The sword in the manga is in the shape of a Longsword. It has a thick-looking blade. It has a gold blade with some rust laying around it. It's wooden handle looks mildly chipped. It's pretty hard to hold. The reason on why it's hard to hold is because of the heavy blade. It's in a pyramid in a room full of treasures.","completion":"This sword sounds like a unique and mysterious artifact that can serve as a captivating centerpiece for your manga's story. Here are some additional considerations that might enrich the narrative and details around the sword: 1. Significance of the Sword: Why is the sword important? Does its significance lie purely in its historical and material value, or is there a myth or prophecy associated with it? Maybe it was said to have been wielded by a legendary figure or confers power or authority to whoever possesses it. 2. Challenges to Acquire the Sword: Due to its heavy blade and unwieldy nature, perhaps only the \\"worthy\\" or those with specific knowledge or strength can wield it effectively. This could add a layer of challenge in obtaining and using the sword. It might be protected by traps, puzzles, or guardians in the pyramid. 3. Design: The description of a gold blade with rust and a chipped wooden handle suggests both grandeur and age, hinting at both its preciousness and the long passage of time since it was last used. These visual elements can also be used to hint at the sword's history and the various powers or curses it might hold. 4. Setting: A room full of treasures in a pyramid could suggest that there are other valuable artifacts, setting the scene for potential distractions, decoys, or additional finds for the archaeologists. It could also imply that the pyramid might attract other treasure hunters or archaeologists with competing interests. 5. The Sword's Powers or Curse: If you want to add a supernatural element to your story, the sword could possess certain powers or a curse that affects those who come into contact with it or try to wield it. This could introduce a moral or ethical dilemma, or a physical challenge for the characters to overcome. 6. Conflict and Rivalry: Given the valuable nature of the sword, other parties—whether they are government agents, rival archaeologists, or mercenaries—could also be after it, and this could lead to confrontations, alliances, or betrayals. 7. The Sword's Origin: The backstory of how the sword came to be in the Pharaoh's tomb, despite being a Longsword—a weapon design not typical to ancient Egypt—could be an intriguing mystery for the characters to unravel. It may suggest a historical crossover or trade between civilizations or be part of a still greater hidden history that you could slowly reveal. Integrating details about the sword into the art and storyline will help in creating a rich and immersive world for readers to enjoy. Your characters' attempts to understand, claim, and perhaps ultimately decide the fate of the sword can drive the narrative forward and keep readers engaged."},{"prompt":"OK, time to talk about the 3 main characters. First one, is a young man named Elliot. He's a former Korean War pilot, holder of a Medal of Honor, had good grades in physics, after he was discharged he worked as a taxi driver, quit a year later and started working as a sports newspaper writer. He has short black hair and brown eyes. He has a outfit similar to that of Indiana Jones except he doesn't have a hat and his jacket is black and his pants look like flight suit pants.","completion":"Elliot seems like a richly detailed character with a compelling background that could bring depth to your manga. His diverse experiences suggest a character of considerable skill, adaptability, and adventure. Here's how each of these elements could impact his role in the story: 1. Military Background: Elliot's experience as a Korean War pilot and a Medal of Honor recipient will likely have instilled in him discipline, bravery, and a sense of strategy. These traits could serve him well in the often-dangerous environments of archaeological exploration and in dealing with any adversaries that arise due to the Cold War tensions. 2. Academics and Physics: His good grades in physics might suggest he has a logical and analytical mind. This knowledge could help him in understanding ancient technologies, navigating the potentially complex traps in the pyramid, or solving puzzles related to the sword's lore. 3. Diverse Work History: Working as a taxi driver and sports newspaper writer post-military service indicates a character who's searching for his place in the world, possibly seeking a sense of purpose or adventure that his former lives didn't quite fulfill. 4. Physical Appearance and Outfit: Short black hair and brown eyes provide visual anchors for your readers, while his outfit that echoes Indiana Jones—but with unique touches like no hat and a black jacket—might signal his adventurous spirit, yet also demonstrate he's his own character with a distinct style. 5. Flight Suit Pants: These could be a nod to his past, serving as a constant reminder of his experiences and the skill set he carries from his days as a pilot. They might also grant him practical benefits in terms of mobility or storage while discovering archaeological sites. When weaving Elliot's backstory into the narrative, consider how these elements might affect his interactions with other characters, including the other two archaeologists in the group. His diverse skill set can come in handy, and his past could provide personal stakes or emotional depth to the quest for the sword. Perhaps he sees the quest as a way to repurpose his life positively, fuelling his drive to succeed where others might give up. An interesting character facet to explore could be how his experience in war, a direct life-and-death confrontation, contrasts with the subtler, more cerebral challenges of archaeology and how he adapts to those differences. Additionally, his military honor might play a role in how he conducts himself ethically throughout the story, especially if faced with dilemmas that question the morality of removing cultural artifacts or navigating political tensions during the Cold War. Remember to flesh out his personal growth arc and how the journey changes him, which will help readers form a deeper connection with Elliot as the story unfolds."},{"prompt":"He has a messenger bag, his jacket has a few insignias patched on it and his weapon is the Colt M1911 he had in service. The insignias on his jacket include the USA flag, his corporal rank insignia and the patch of the Far East Air Forces 5th Air Force.","completion":"Elliot's personal effects and attire can tell a lot about his character and history without needing explicit exposition. Here's how these details might contribute to both character development and readers' understanding of his past: 1. Messenger Bag: A practical choice for an adventurer or archaeologist, it suggests he likes to keep important items and tools close. The contents of this bag could become central to various situations in the story—perhaps he keeps maps, research notes, or even personal mementos within. 2. Jacket Insignias: - USA Flag: Displays his patriotism and ties to his home country, which could be a point of pride or a source of inner conflict, given the complexities of the Cold War. - Corporal Rank Insignia: Carrying his military rank into his civilian life could indicate that his service time had a significant impact on his identity. - Far East Air Forces 5th Air Force Patch: This detail shows readers a specific connection to his past and serves as a reminder of where he has been and what he has experienced. It also could hint at a deep understanding of East Asian cultures, geography, or political situations that may come into play during the story. 3. Weapon - Colt M1911: - This choice of weapon ties Elliot directly to his military past and suggests a familiarity and comfort with firearms. It's also a quintessentially American firearm, which may contribute to the Indiana Jones-esque feel of the character. - The fact that he carries a weapon from his service days may suggest a readiness or expectation of danger, aligning with the action-adventure theme of your manga. It might also be a source of tension or conflict if others in his team are less inclined towards using lethal force. Elliot's attire and equipment are practical and rich with history, situating him strongly in the post-WWII and Cold War eras. These props, along with engaging character interactions and a dynamic plot, will help flesh out Elliot's character and make him resonate with readers. As you illustrate Elliot, the visual representations of these insignias and his gear will help establish his character quickly to readers, using visual storytelling to complement the narrative. His past experiences, the significance of the items he carries, and how he uses them throughout the story can also serve as windows into his psyche, revealing more about his character during moments of stress, decision-making, and personal reflection."},{"prompt":"He was born around the early 1930s, grew up in the 1940s and joined the USAF in 1950 and served until 1955 since in the timeline this manga takes place in, the Korean War lasted longer until 1956. He managed to get the Navy's Cross, the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart. He was discharged in the November in 1955 due to a F-86 crash. He is 38 years old around the time this manga takes place in and he is probably the most mature member of the trio.","completion":"Elliot's background and timeline add layers of complexity to his character: 1. Childhood in the 1940s: Growing up during World War II could have deeply influenced Elliot's values and beliefs. Those formative years might have been marked by a sense of duty, sacrifice, and nationalism that molded him into the person he becomes in the story. 2. Extended Korean War Service: By extending the Korean War in your manga's timeline, you can explore alternative historical trajectories and their impact on the characters. Elliot's lengthened service means he spent some of his most formative years in the military, which likely solidified his sense of identity as a soldier. 3. Decorated Veteran: His receipt of high military honors indicates that he has showcased extraordinary heroism and dedication. The Navy Cross and Medal of Honor are awarded for extreme acts of valor, while the Purple Heart is awarded to those wounded or killed in service, suggesting he has seen intense combat and has been wounded in the line of duty. This history can lend him a sense of gravitas and could affect his mental state and physical capabilities, potentially introducing themes related to post-war trauma or survivor's guilt. 4. Discharge due to Crash: The F-86 crash leading to his discharge could be a pivotal event in his backstory. It might have been a humbling or psychologically transforming experience, forcing him out of active service and into a period of reflection and redefinition of his identity and place in the world. 5. Age and Maturity: At 38, Elliot is presumably at an age where he is still physically capable but also possesses the wisdom that comes with experience. Being the most mature member of the group, he might often find himself in a leadership position or act as the voice of reason during conflicts within the team. In crafting Elliot's persona and role within the trio, consider how these experiences have shaped his outlook on life, his interactions with others, and his ethical framework. His maturity could be a stabilizing force or a source of conflict if it clashes with less experienced or more impulsive members of the team. Additionally, as a manga artist or writer, you have the ability to visually and narratively hint at his past. Subtle cues like scars, a thoughtful expression when looking at planes or military insignia, or a nuanced conversational style could all hint at his experiences. These details will make Elliot a compelling, multi-dimensional character whose history informs his actions and decision-making in the pursuit of the sword. Remember that the depth of a character is often revealed as much through their actions and decisions under pressure as through their backstory. How Elliot approaches the quest for the sword, interacts with allies and enemies, and confronts the physical and ethical challenges of archaeology will allow his maturity and history to shine through in an engaging manner for readers."},{"prompt":"That F-86 crash caused him to have a medium-sized scar on his chest because of a small piece of his plane's cockpit hitting his chest.","completion":"Elliot's scar is a tangible reminder of his past, serving as both a physical and emotional mark of his experiences. Here's how this detail can play a role in your manga: 1. **Visual Representation**: When depicting Elliot, you have the opportunity for a poignant visual moment if and when the scar is revealed. It could happen during a moment of vulnerability or during a scene where his injuries become relevant to the story. This reveal can serve as a powerful narrative device, offering insight into his character without relying on exposition. 2. **Symbolism**: Scars are often used in storytelling to symbolize past trauma, resilience, and survival. Elliot's scar could symbolize not only the crash itself but also the end of one chapter of his life and the beginning of another. It may also represent the hardships he's overcome and his determination to push forward despite them. 3. **Impacting Interactions**: Characters reacting to Elliot's scar can reveal a lot about their personalities and their relationships with him. Some may express concern or curiosity, while others might see it as a sign of strength or a badge of honor. 4. **Character Development**: How Elliot deals with his scar—whether he hides it, speaks openly about it, or uses it as a teaching moment—can demonstrate his attitude towards his past. It can show whether he has accepted his experiences or if he's still troubled by them. 5. **Plot Device**: The scar could potentially serve as a plot device within certain situations. For example, it might be a physical reminder of his vulnerability during strenuous activities or serve as a clue to other characters that he is the decorated pilot they've heard about. 6. **Empathy and Relatability**: For readers, physical imperfections such as scars make characters feel more real, human, and relatable. It can evoke empathy and build a stronger emotional connection between Elliot and the audience. As you incorporate Elliot's scar into the narrative, remember that showing how he copes with his past injury can open up opportunities to address broader themes such as the physical and psychological costs of war, the process of healing, and the concept of carrying one's scars with pride. Balancing when and how to integrate his scar into the story will add to the richness of his character and the depth of his backstory, enhancing the overall reader experience."},{"prompt":"Time to talk about his 2 companions! Let's talk about his first one, Edward. He has short dark blonde hair and brown eyes. He is 26. He has a sassy and playful attitude. He is sort of based off of England from Hetalia. His outfit consists of a short-sleeve white shirt, brown cargo shorts, sandals and stripper clips on his belt alongside two revolver holsters where he can keep either a Webley revolver and a S&W M1917, both of them being WW1-era. He mentions that he went to college in Scotland which he kind of misses.","completion":"Edward sounds like a character that brings a lively dynamic to the team and offers a contrasting personality to Elliot's more mature and experienced demeanor. Here are some key points to consider for Edward's character development: 1. **Appearance and Attitude**: Edward's youthful looks, with short dark blonde hair and a sassy, playful attitude, could serve as a foil to the more serious and reserved Elliot. His attitude can infuse the story with humor and light-heartedness, which will be important for balance in a potentially action-heavy, dramatic plot. 2. **Outfit**: The choice of casual attire (short-sleeve shirt, cargo shorts, sandals) suggests that Edward may not take things as seriously as Elliot, or perhaps he's more adaptable and less constrained by tradition or formality. This outfit could also reflect his preference for comfort or a readiness to work in warmer climates, which is appropriate for archaeological digs in regions like Egypt. 3. **Armaments**: Carrying two revolvers from WWI could indicate a fascination with history or a penchant for collecting and using older, proven technologies. It also adds a unique twist to his character, distinguishing him from Elliot, who uses a more modern firearm. The choice of weapons could suggest Edward prefers reliability and style over modern firepower, and it could also hint at a certain bravado. 4. **Background**: Mentioning that he went to college in Scotland can be a way to introduce his educational background and possibly a longing for a place he considers a second home. It might influence his behavior, viewpoints, and possibly even an accent – all of which will add depth to his character. 5. **Role in the Team**: Given Edward's age and demeanor, he could be the one who challenges decisions, takes risks, or looks for alternative solutions that Elliot might not consider. His playfulness might also help to defuse tense situations or provide comic relief, but when the situation calls for it, he could show unexpected depths of courage and resourcefulness. 6. **Character Dynamics**: Edward's relations with Elliot and the third team member will be significant. There might be a mentor-mentee dynamic, a friendly rivalry, or a more complex relationship shaped by their contrasting personalities and experiences. 7. **Personal Growth**: Throughout the story, Edward's character arc could explore themes of maturity and responsibility. His experiences during the quest for the sword might test his sassy and playful nature, leading to personal growth and self-discovery. When creating Edward, consider how his lighter personality traits and historic weapons might play into the larger narrative, including any challenges the team might face in the field. Additionally, his remembrance of Scotland could introduce subplots or character interactions that explore themes of nostalgia, belonging, or identity. In terms of manga storytelling, Edward's character design and dialogue will be key in communicating his personality and attitude to the reader quickly. His interactions with the environment, artifacts, and secondary characters could be used to highlight his inquisitiveness and playful nature while acclimating the reader to his role within the group dynamic."},{"prompt":"His outfit is sort of based off of the uniforms that British soldiers wore during the North African campaign in WW2. He has a sheathed Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife on the back of his belt.","completion":"Edward's outfit being inspired by British soldier uniforms from the North African campaign adds a layer of historical homage to your manga and could serve several narrative functions: 1. **Visual Style**: His attire will evoke the imagery of World War II and might appeal to readers interested in military history. Readers with knowledge of that period might immediately draw connections to the setting and the types of challenges such soldiers faced, such as desert climates and guerrilla warfare. 2. **Character Insight**: Choosing to wear such an outfit implies that Edward might have a deep interest in or connection to military history, perhaps a family legacy or a personal fascination. It also suggests that he puts thought into his gear's functionality and historical significance. 3. **Practicality**: Uniforms from the North African campaign would be suitable in hot, sandy conditions commonly found in Egypt and surrounding areas. It conveys that Edward is not only stylish but also sensible when it comes to outfitting himself for the environment he expects to be working in. 4. **Fairbairn–Sykes Fighting Knife**: The inclusion of this specific knife, known for its use by British Commandos during World War II, further ties Edward to military history. The knife is a symbol of silent efficiency and close combat, suggesting that Edward is prepared for situations that might require stealth or hand-to-hand encounters. As you develop Edward's character, think about how his historical interests, represented by his attire and equipment, might influence his behavior and interactions within the narrative. For instance, his choice of clothing and weapons can be conversation starters, leading to discussions about history, strategy, and personal interests that flesh out his character. Given the setting of your manga, Edward's combat-ready approach to dressing and arming himself might reflect an anticipation of danger or a desire to emulate the heroic figures from the era his gear represents. It also sets him up as someone who values tradition and craftsmanship in his equipment choices. In terms of the manga's art style, Edward's homage to North African campaign uniforms will contrast with Elliot's aviation-themed attire, providing readers with a clear visual distinction between the characters and reinforcing the notion that each has their own unique brand of expertise and approach to the adventure. His choice of a Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife also opens up potential for close-combat scenes, adding tension and action to the narrative. Your depiction of Edward expertly wielding the knife or reverently maintaining it could speak volumes about his character's skillset and respect for the tools of his trade without requiring extensive dialogue."},{"prompt":"That one part where his rifle pouches do come useful, he manages to get a Lee-Enfield, drools over it for a few seconds and keeps it as a souvenir from his journey. In his own words when he sees that Lee-Enfield, \\"Look at that beautiful walnut furniture, the tasteful thickness of it. Oh my god. It even has the flip-up sights.\\"","completion":"Edward's reverence for the Lee-Enfield rifle adds character depth and provides an interesting moment in your manga. His affinity for vintage firearms and military history is highlighted through his reaction, allowing you to further explore his character traits through his passions. Here's how you can integrate this scene into your manga: 1. **Character Passion**: Edward's detailed observation about the rifle's features, such as the walnut furniture and flip-up sights, showcases his expertise and deep appreciation for historic weaponry. These moments of passion can make him more likable and relatable to readers. 2. **Humor and Light-heartedness**: His near-adoration of the rifle brings a touch of humor and levity to the narrative. It's easy to imagine this scene breaking up tension within the story, offering readers a chuckle as Edward momentarily forgets his surroundings to fawn over the gun. 3. **Collectible Element**: The Lee-Enfield could become a physical representation of Edward's personal journey and growth throughout the manga. The rifle could also come into play later in the story as more than just a collectible, perhaps serving a practical purpose during a critical moment. 4. **Character Development**: Edward's excitement contrasts with the perhaps more practical or mission-focused mindsets of his companions. This difference can be used to create or resolve conflict, emphasize group dynamics, or trigger a turning point that affects group cohesion. 5. **Storytelling Tool**: The way you depict Edward's encounter with the Lee-Enfield can be illustrative of his personality. The level of detail you include when drawing this scene—the shine on the wood, the glint in his eye, his body language—will convey his character's excitement without the need for extensive dialogue. 6. **Audience Connection**: For readers who are also firearms enthusiasts, Edward's detailed and knowledgeable reaction to the Lee-Enfield rifle could forge a stronger connection to the character. It's a moment of shared enthusiasm between character and reader. In your manga, such details give depth to the world you're building and create a sense of realism within the adventure. These authentic touches regarding period-specific weapons can also serve as a nod to history buffs and military enthusiasts in your audience. Incorporating elements like the Lee-Enfield into the story provides an excellent opportunity to further develop Edward's character. His interactions with historical artifacts reflect his interests and expertise, deepening his role in the manga while enhancing the overall narrative tapestry with rich historical threads."},{"prompt":"Kashimo blows Yuta’s head off.

Voici une contre-argumentation à la déclaration que Kashimo souffle la tête de Yuta : Dans le contexte d'une histoire de fiction, surtout si elle inclut des éléments surnaturels ou fantastiques, la mort d'un personnage n'est pas nécessairement permanente ni sans contournement possible. Par exemple, Yuta pourrait avoir des capacités de régénération qui lui permettent de survivre à des blessures mortelles telles que la perte de sa tête.

The version of Watchman you mentioned is \\"2023.12.04.00,\\" which seems to indicate a release from December 4, 2023, going by the version naming convention (year.month.day.patch). However, you've mentioned that the supported version is \\"4.x,\\" which usually denotes an earlier major version of the software. Since software versions often evolve and newer versions may not always be backwards compatible, it's important to review the documentation for the specific version you are working with. If you are using a project that requires version 4.x of Watchman, it may be built with dependencies or configurations that expect features or behaviors present in that major version series. Using a version from the 2023 release cycle might introduce unexpected behavior or break functionality if breaking changes were introduced after version 4.x. It's essential to refer to the project's documentation or maintainers to understand the specific version requirements. If necessary, you might have to install version 4.x of Watchman to ensure compatibility with your project. Here are some general steps you might follow to address the version discrepancy: 1. Check the project's documentation for specific version requirements. 2. If a specific version is required (such as 4.x) and it differs from what you have (2023.12.04.00), you might need to downgrade or install the correct version. 3. Consult the official Watchman documentation or repository for instructions on how to obtain and install the required version. If you are a project maintainer and would be okay with updating the project to support the latest version of Watchman, you could: 1. Test the project with the 2023 version to identify and resolve any possible incompatibilities. 2. Update the project's documentation to ensure the proper version of Watchman is specified for future developers. Note: The versions mentioned in this guidance may not correspond to actual releases of the Watchman software if those versions have not been released as of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023.

She is to be kept in a standard containment binder, including various sheets of blank white 8 x 10 inch paper along with a selection of artistic media, which is to be replaced on a weekly basis. Transfer between mediums is to be strictly monitored and only allowed during sanctioned tests. **Purpose of Test:** To observe the behavior, adaptability, and appearance of SCP-085 when transitioning from blank paper to a detailed image of an 18-wheeled tractor trailer. **Materials Needed:** - The current containment binder of SCP-085 - Photograph of an 18-wheeled tractor trailer (8 x 10 inches) - Standard writing instruments for SCP-085’s use - High-resolution camera for documentation **Pre-Test Notes:** SCP-085, or \\"Cassy\\", has demonstrated a consistent ability to transfer her 2D form between connected paper-based mediums. Previous tests have shown that her appearance and attire adapt to her environment within the medium she occupies. **Test Procedure:** 1. Brief SCP-085 on the test parameters and gain her compliance. 2. Introduce the photograph of the 18-wheeled tractor trailer to the edge of SCP-085’s current paper. 3. Allow SCP-085 to transfer herself onto the photograph. 4. Observe and record any changes in SCP-085's appearance. 5. Engage with SCP-085 to gather her written impressions and thoughts on the transition and the new environment. 6. Allow SCP-085 to write an inspirational message within the context of her new medium. 7. Conclude test and review observations with SCP-085. **Test Log:** **Begin Log** - Upon being briefed, SCP-085 appears curious and willing to participate in the test. - Photograph is presented, and SCP-085 transitions onto it smoothly. High-resolution images are taken to document her changes. - **Description of SCP-085's new appearance:** - **Face and Expression:** SCP-085's face adapts to the gritty aesthetic of the tractor trailer background. Her expression appears determined, echoing the rugged theme of the image, with a light frown that may indicate focus or contemplation. - **Skin, Eyes, and Hair:** Cassy's skin takes on a slightly weathered appearance, akin to someone familiar with long travels. Her eyes reflect a vivid sky-blue hue, providing a stark contrast to the otherwise monochromatic setting. Hair color adapts to a sandy brown, drawn with strands suggesting movement as if blown by a passing breeze. - **Attire:** SCP-085's attire transforms to resemble that of a modern trucker. She now dons a plaid flannel shirt, a denim vest with a visible name patch, and worn jeans. A trucker hat sits atop her head, shading her eyes. - SCP-085 proceeds to write a message on the side of the trailer using a bold, legible script: “Keep on Truckin'!” This phrase encapsulates the classic motivational spirit consistent with the vernacular associated with the depicted environment. **Engagement Log with SCP-085 Post-Test:** - SCP-085 writes that the transition felt \\"normal\\" but the new medium was \\"exciting.\\" - She mentions a sense of freedom and strength while \\"driving\\" along the highway in the photograph but also a bit of melancholy due to the solitude of the open road. - She details observing distant landscapes, feeling the rumble of the engine, and the camaraderie among her fellow truckers in the image. - SCP-085 expresses a lasting impression of the vastness and beauty of open roads, leaving her with a newfound appreciation for travel. **End Log** **Post-Test Analysis and Notes:** SCP-085's adaptive traits were thoroughly documented, showcasing her inherent capacity to seamlessly integrate into diverse environments within a 2D space. Her psychological well-being remains stable, and she continues to express a positive and cooperative demeanor. Further study may be directed at understanding the extent of SCP-085's adaptability and whether her experiences in these varied mediums have any cumulative effects on her 2D persona.
