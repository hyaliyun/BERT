Next, we must consider whether ( y ) has a minimum period ( T ), or could it be that ( y ) might not have a smallest positive period at all. 4. To illustrate this, let's consider specific examples: - Let ( f_1(x) = sin x ) and ( f_2(x) = -sin x ): [ y = sin x + (-sin x) = 0 ] The function ( y(x) = 0 ) is periodic for any non-zero period, meaning there is no smallest positive period. Hence, ( y ) does not have a smallest positive period, demonstrating it could be a periodic function but without a smallest positive period. 5. Let's also analyze other scenarios to understand further. Consider the case where ( f(x) = sin x ) and ( g(x) = sin(pi x) ): - The function ( sin x + 1 ) is a periodic function, while ( sin x + sin(pi x) ) is not periodic due to the irrational period ratio.

We need to show that the ratio of each diagonal to its corresponding parallel side is the same for all such pairs of segments in the pentagon, and we are to determine this common ratio. Step 1: Establishing Parallel Pairs First, note that each diagonal has a unique side that it is parallel to. For instance, in the pentagon (ABCDE), the side (AB) has a parallel diagonal, and the only possible diagonal that can be parallel to (AB) is (CE), as the other diagonals involve endpoints (A) and (B), which start two diagonals each (reference to the configuration shown in Figure 1). Step 2: The Required Proof and Symmetry Argument It is sufficient to prove that the ratio of the lengths (AD:BC = AC:ED), i.e., the diagonals and their corresponding parallel sides from the same vertex, are equal. Since the pentagon does not distinguish any side or vertex specifically, a similar argument holds by cyclic rotation of the vertices. Thereby, if we relabel the vertices such that (A to C), (B to D), (C to E), and so forth, the relation still holds and concludes that the mentioned ratio is equal for any pair of corresponding segments. This suggests our final result will be true universally across similar pairs. Step 3: Verification with Parallel Lines Theorem Let’s denote the intersections of diagonal (BE) with diagonals (AC) and (AD) by points (F) and (G) respectively. In the resulting parallelograms formed by edges (BC) and (BC = GD), and (FC = ED), according to the intercept theorem’s application on angle (angle CAD): [ frac{AD}{BC} = frac{AD}{GD} = frac{AC}{FC} = frac{AC}{ED} ] Thus, we have shown the desired equality. Calculation of the Ratio Using the equivalence (x = frac{BE}{CD} = frac{BE}{CD} + 1), we simplify this equation using properties of similar triangles formed due to the parallel lines: [ x = frac{BF + FE}{FE} = frac{BF}{FE} + 1 = frac{BA}{CE} + 1 = frac{1}{x} + 1 ] Solving the quadratic equation (x^2 - x - 1 = 0): [ x = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] Thus, the consistent ratio among all such pairs in the pentagon is given by [ x = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} approx 1.618 ] Conclusion This final ratio is also known as the Golden Ratio, displayed uniquely in convex pentagonal structures of this nature.

We need to carefully read the problem and make reasonable use of the definitions of trigonometric functions. From the given information, we have sin alpha = frac{m}{sqrt{3 + m^2}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}m. Our goal is to find the value of m, which will help us determine the quadrant of angle alpha. Solution steps: 1. We know that the terminal side of angle alpha passes through point P(-sqrt{3}, m), where m neq 0. Let's denote the coordinates of point P as (x, y) = (-sqrt{3}, m). 2. Recall that the sine function can be defined as sin alpha = frac{y}{r}, where r = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} is the distance from the point to the origin. In this case, we have r = sqrt{(-sqrt{3})^2 + m^2} = sqrt{3 + m^2}. 3. Given that sin alpha = frac{m}{sqrt{3 + m^2}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}m, we can simplify this equation as follows: frac{m}{sqrt{3 + m^2}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}m 4. Squaring both sides and simplifying further, we get: m^2 = frac{7}{3} 5. Taking the square root of both sides, we find two possible values for m: m = pm frac{sqrt{21}}{3} 6.

We know that 0.overline{ab} can be written as frac{ab}{99}, where ab represents the two-digit number formed by digits a and b. This is because the repeating decimal 0.overline{ab} means ab repeats indefinitely, and the fraction form of a repeating decimal with two digits repeating is given by the two digits over 99. Next, we need to consider the factors of 99 to understand the possible denominators of the fraction in its lowest terms. Factoring 99 gives us 99 = 3^2 cdot 11.

To understand why, note that with more than 4 sides, the polygon has enough degrees of freedom to allow such a deformation. For a more comprehensive proof, we refer to the solution of problem 78105. subsection*{Case 2: n = 4} For n = 4, any quadrilateral can be deformed into another quadrilateral, except for the specific case of a parallelogram (textit{including the special cases of rectangles and squares}). Consider a quadrilateral A_1A_2A_3A_4: - If it is not a parallelogram, due to the degrees of freedom in the hinges, it can be deformed into other shapes but will maintain its four vertices configurations. - However, it can be continuously deformed from one rectangle to another with different side lengths but cannot collapse into a triangle due to the constraints of the fixed lengths of the rods and the nature of the hinges. Thus, when n = 4, the quadrilateral cannot be deformed into a triangle if it remains a linked quadrilateral with hinge joints. subsection*{Case 3: n < 4} For n < 4: - When n = 3, the polygon is already a triangle and cannot be deformed further while maintaining the rigid rod lengths. - When n = 2 or n = 1, these do not form closed shapes that can be compared with a polygon. subsection*{Conclusion} It is evident that a polygon with more than 3 sides, specifically n > 4, can be deformed into a triangle.

Prove that the number of selfintersections of the broken line is at most frac{3}{2}n^{2} 2n + 1","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a closed broken line consisting of (3n) line segments in the Euclidean plane, with no three vertices collinear. Each triangle (A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2}) has a counterclockwise orientation and an angle of (60^circ). We need to prove that the number of self-intersections of the broken line is at most (frac{3}{2}n^2 - 2n + 1). 2. **Analyzing the Line Segments:** Since each triangle (A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2}) has an angle of (60^circ), the line segments can be grouped into three sets of (n) parallel segments each. Let's denote these sets as (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n), (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n), and (C_1, C_2, ldots, C_n). 3. **Ordering the Segments:** We can order the segments in each set from outside to inside. This ordering is not related to the indices of their vertices. Let (A_1, ldots, A_n) and (B_1, ldots, B_n) be the resulting lines from two different directions. 4. **Describing the Linking by Permutations:** Each (A_i) is linked to some (B_{pi(i)}), where (pi) is a permutation. A line (A_i) intersects a line (B_{pi(j)}) if and only if (i < j) and (pi(i) > pi(j)). Thus, the number of intersections is the number of inversions of (pi), denoted as (text{inv}(pi)). 5. **Total Number of Intersections:** Let (pi_1, pi_2, pi_3) be the three permutations corresponding to the three directions. The total number of intersections is (text{inv}(pi_1) + text{inv}(pi_2) + text{inv}(pi_3)). Each permutation has (text{inv}(pi) leq frac{n(n-1)}{2}), so the total number of intersections could be as large as (3 cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2}). 6. **Considering the Connected Line:** The line should be connected, which means (pi_1 circ pi_2 circ pi_3) is a permutation with just one cycle of length (n). We need to show that (text{inv}(pi_1) + text{inv}(pi_2) + text{inv}(pi_3) leq frac{3}{2} n^2 - 2n + 1). 7. **Toy Example:** Consider the case where two of the permutations have the maximal number of inversions, i.e., (pi_1 = pi_2 = tau) where (tau(k) = n+1-k). Since (tau^2 = 1), the condition is that (pi_3 = pi) has one cycle, and we need to prove that (text{inv}(pi) leq frac{n(n-1)}{2} - frac{n}{2} + 1). 8. **Bounding the Number of Inversions:** A permutation with many inversions should be close to (tau). If (text{inv}(pi) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - k), then (pi circ tau) has exactly (k) inversions and can be written as a product of (k) transpositions. Thus, (pi) can be written as (tau alpha_1 ldots alpha_k). 9. **Number of Cycles:** Composing with a transposition alters the number of cycles by exactly 1. Since (tau) has at least (frac{n}{2}) cycles, (pi) has at least (frac{n}{2} - k) cycles. Given that (pi) has one cycle, (frac{n}{2} - k leq 1), and the claim follows. 10. **General Case:** Writing (text{inv}(pi_1) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - k), (text{inv}(pi_2) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - ell), and (text{inv}(pi_3) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - m), we need to prove that (k + ell + m geq frac{n}{2} - 1). 11. **Combining Permutations:** We can write (pi_1 = tau alpha_1 ldots alpha_k), (pi_2 = tau beta_1 ldots beta_ell), and (pi_3 = tau gamma_1 ldots gamma_m). The condition is that (tau alpha_1 ldots alpha_k tau beta_1 ldots beta_ell tau gamma_1 ldots gamma_m) has only one cycle. 12. **Cycle Count:** This implies that (tau alpha_1 ldots alpha_k tau beta_1 ldots beta_ell tau) has at least (m + 1) cycles. Since (tau = tau^{-1}), conjugation by any permutation does not change the cycle type. Thus, (alpha_1 ldots alpha_k tau beta_1 ldots beta_ell) has at most (m + 1) cycles. 13. **Final Bound:** We can proceed as before to see that (tau) has at most (k + ell + m + 1) cycles, from which the claim follows.

Since the probability of both being sweet pomegranates is frac{2}{5}, there are 6 outcomes among the 15 that are both sweet pomegranates. Since only the selection of 2 out of 4 pomegranates results in 6 outcomes, assume a, b, c, d are sweet pomegranates, resulting in the outcomes (a, b), (a, c), (a, d), (b, c), (b, d), (c, d) being all sweet pomegranates.

We then analyze the sums of sequences that increase by 5 terms each (i.e., S_5, S_{10}, S_{15}, etc.). Let's consider the following differences between sums of consecutive 5-term intervals: (S_{10} - S_5) : S_5 = -1 : 2 This follows from the fact that the ratio 1:2 implies that S_{10} = frac{1}{3}(S_{10} + S_5) which can be rearranged as S_{10} - S_5 = -frac{1}{2} S_5. Moving onto the next interval, for a geometric sequence, the property of constant ratios between consecutive sums implies: (S_{15} - S_{10}) : (S_{10} - S_5) : S_5 = 1 : (-2) : 4 This is because the ratio of consecutive differences will be equal to the common ratio of the geometric sequence squared (since each term is a sum of a geometric sequence, increasing the sum index by 5 multiplies the sum by the common ratio squared). Hence, we have S_{15} - S_{10} = -2(S_{10} - S_5). Substituting the value of (S_{10} - S_5) from earlier, S_{15} - S_{10} = -2 cdot -frac{1}{2} S_5 = S_5 Thus, adding S_{10} to both sides gives us S_{15} = S_{10} + S_5 = frac{1}{2}S_5 + S_5 = frac{3}{2}S_5 Now, we determine the desired ratio: frac{S_{15}}{S_5} = frac{3}{2} Therefore, we can conclude that the ratio S_{15} to S_5 is boxed{3:2}."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to the angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c, with a=2.

For a number to be divisible by 5, its units digit (b) must be either 0 or 5. For a number to be divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which is a bit more complex. However, since we are looking for a two-digit number, we can simply list the multiples of 7 that are also multiples of 5 and are two-digit numbers: 35, 70.

Consider the rectangle with the leftmost right boundary and the rectangle with the rightmost left boundary. 2. By the given conditions, a vertical line exists that intersects both of these rectangles. Denote this line as L. 3. Any remaining rectangle must have its left boundary to the left of L and its right boundary to the right of L. 4. Thus, the vertical line L will intersect all the rectangles in the family. Hence, the lemma is proven. --- Now let's proceed to solve the main problem. We are required to demonstrate that we can draw one horizontal and one vertical line such that any rectangle on our plane will be intersected by at least one of these lines. **Solution of the main problem:** 1. **Assume the contrary:** Assume there do not exist such a horizontal and vertical line. 2. **Define separated pairs:** We will call two rectangles separated if a vertical line cannot intersect both of them. Proceed similarly for horizontal lines. 3. Consider all pairs of separated rectangles. Let's say (A, B) is a pair of rectangles that cannot be intersected by any vertical line. 4. **Case 1:** There is no pair of separated rectangles below the horizontal line h. - Draw the line h and consider all rectangles not intersected by it. - By the lemma, if there are no vertically separated pairs among them, then they can be intersected by a single vertical line. This would prove the problem statement. Suppose such a pair does exist. - If such a pair (A, B) exists, select rectangle A to lie above h by the selection of h. 5. **Case 2:** There exists a pair (C, D) of separated rectangles below the line h. - Select rectangle A to lie to the left and rectangle B to the right. Assume without loss of generality that the right side of A is not to the right of the right side of C. - This configuration ensures A and D are also separated. - One of these rectangles lies above h while the other lies below h. Thus, if such configurations of rectangles exist, we cannot intersect them all by either a single vertical line or a single horizontal line, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption must be false. **Conclusion:** We can indeed draw one horizontal and one vertical line such that any rectangle on the plane will be intersected by at least one of these lines. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Which of the following equations has no real roots?

Each vertex in ( V ) has degree 5, meaning there are 5 edges connecting each vertex to other vertices. 2. **Partition the graph**: The people are partitioned into two teams, say ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ). As the captains pick members, they are placed into one of these two teams until all members are assigned. 3. **Define ( e(T_1) ) and ( e(T_2) )**: Let ( e(T_1) ) be the number of edges (acquaintances) entirely within team ( T_1 ), and let ( e(T_2) ) be the number of edges entirely within team ( T_2 ). 4. **Total edges and cross-team edges**: The total number of edges in the graph, by Handshaking Lemma (sum of degrees equals twice the number of edges), is [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 5n quad text{(where ( n ) is the number of vertices and (deg(v) = 5) for all (v in V ))} ] Therefore, the total number of edges is [ frac{5n}{2} = frac{5n}{2} ] Since each edge contributes to ( e(T_1) ), ( e(T_2) ), or crosses between the two teams, let ( e(T_1, T_2) ) be the number of edges between ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ). Thus, we have: [ frac{5n}{2} = e(T_1) + e(T_2) + e(T_1, T_2) ] 5. **Symmetry Argument with Alternating Picks**: Aspects of symmetry in selection plays a role in balancing acquaintances. Both teams ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) are choosing alternately, thus affecting the total count evenly by symmetrical nature of choices (since both teams start with zero members and grow similarly). 6. **Using Pigeonhole Principle**: When the last person is picked, they won't affect ( e(T_1) ) and ( e(T_2) ) drastically that the sum wouldn't balance out around symmetric numbers due to the constant pairing over alternate picks. 7. **Conclusion Using Mean Argument**: As the average degree is 5, and because the selection process is symmetric and alternate, the internal connections (e)(within ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 )) are evenly likely to distribute: [ boxed{e(T_1) = e(T_2)} ] In conclusion, using the properties of graphs, balance through alternate picks, and symmetry inherent in the process described, we can ensure that each team contains exactly the same number of mutually acquainted pairs by the end.

Let ( G = (V, E) ) be a graph where ( V ) represents the members of parliament and ( E ) represents the political enmities. Given that every member has at most 3 political enemies means the maximum degree ( Delta(G) leq 3 ). 2. Consider all possible ways to partition the set ( V ) into two subsets ( V_1 ) and ( V_2 ). This can be achieved by examining two sets of vertices, where ( V_1 cup V_2 = V ) and ( V_1 cap V_2 = emptyset ). 3. Define ( S ) to be the total number of political enemy pairs (entirely) within the two sets. That is, ( S ) is the number of edges inside ( V_1 ) plus the number of edges inside ( V_2 ): [ S = |E(V_1)| + |E(V_2)| ] 4. Since the number of ways to partition ( V ) into ( V_1 ) and ( V_2 ) is finite, there must be a partition that minimizes ( S ). 5. Suppose for contradiction that in this optimal partition, there exists a vertex ( A in V_1 ) which has at least two political enemies within ( V_1 ). Let these enemies be ( B ) and ( C ). 6. If we move vertex ( A ) from ( V_1 ) to ( V_2 ): - The number of enemy pairs in ( V_1 ) decreases by at least ( 1 ). - The number of enemy pairs in ( V_2 ) can increase by at most 1 (because A will have at most one enemy in ( V_2 )). 7. Therefore, moving ( A ) reduces the number of within-set enemy pairs, contradicting the assumption that ( S ) was minimal. 8. Thus, the minimal partition must be such that no vertex has more than one political enemy within its own subset ( V_1 ) or ( V_2 ). # Conclusion: Hence, it is possible to partition the parliament into two houses such that each member has at most one political enemy within the same house.

For point T, substituting y = -frac{2sqrt{6}}{3} into the line segment AB equation y=frac{2}{3}x-2, we solve for x to get T(-sqrt{6}+3,-frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}). For point H, since overrightarrow{MT}=overrightarrow{TH}, we find H(-2sqrt{6}+5,-frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}). The equation of line HN is y=(2+frac{2sqrt{6}}{3})x-2, which indeed passes through the fixed point boxed{K(0,-2)}. # Case (ii): Slope Exists For a line with slope k passing through P(1,-2), its equation is kx-y-(k+2)=0. Let M(x_{1},y_{1}) and N(x_{2},y_{2}) be the intersection points with E. Solving the system of equations formed by the line and the ellipse's equation, we derive: - The quadratic equation for x: (3k^{2}+4)x^{2}-6k(2+k)x+3k(k+4)=0 - This leads to the sum and product of roots formulas: x_{1}+x_{2}=frac{6k(2+k)}{3k^{2}+4} and x_{1}x_{2}=frac{3k(4+k)}{3k^{2}+4}. - Similarly, for y: y_{1}+y_{2}=frac{-8(2+k)}{3k^{2}+4} and y_{1}y_{2}=frac{4(4+4k-2k^{2})}{3k^{2}+4}. Further calculations give x_{1}y_{2}+x_{2}y_{1}=frac{-24k}{3k^{2}+4}. Solving for T and H as before, we find that regardless of the slope k, the line HN always passes through the fixed point boxed{(0,-2)}."},{"prompt":"Show that if ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are three positive real numbers satisfying ( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)=8 ), then: ( a+b+c geqslant 3 ) and ( a b c leqslant 1 ).","completion":"To prove the inequalities, we will use various properties and theorems related to means and inequalities. **Step 1:** Let's start by proving (a + b + c geqslant 3). 1.

Since the contours of the rectangles intersect at eight points, this implies that each side of any given rectangle intersects exactly two other sides of the neighboring rectangle. If any side of one rectangle intersects less than two sides of the other rectangle, there would be fewer than eight points of intersection. Therefore, no side of one rectangle can intersect both parallel sides of the other rectangle. 2. Consider the points (A) and (C) where one pair of sides of length (a) intersects, and points (B) and (D) where another pair of sides of length (b) intersects, as illustrated in Figure 63. Let's denote: - (AC) as the line segment connecting points where the (a)-length sides intersect. - (BD) as the line segment connecting points where the (b)-length sides intersect. 3.

By Vieta's formulas, for the quadratic (ay^2 + by + c = 0), the sum of the roots (y_1) and (y_2) is given by: [ y_1 + y_2 = 2kx ] The product of the roots is given by: [ y_1 y_2 = x^2 - x ] Thus: [ y_2 = 2kx - y_1 ] Since both roots are integers, so is (2kx - y_1). 4. Now, calculate the discriminant (Δ) of the quadratic equation: [ Delta = b^2 - 4ac ] where (a = 1), (b = -2kx), and (c = x^2 - x): [ Delta = (-2kx)^2 - 4(1)(x^2 - x) = 4k^2x^2 - 4(x^2 - x) ] Simplify this: [ Delta = 4k^2x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x = 4x(k^2x - x + 1) = 4x((k^2 - 1)x + 1) ] 5. Since (Delta) is also the square of the difference of the roots (y_2 - y_1), the discriminant must be a perfect square. 6. Notice that (x) and ((k^2 - 1)x + 1) must be coprime for the discriminant to be a perfect square. Therefore, (x) must itself be a perfect square so that (Delta) is ensured to be a perfect square.

This is because, if we drop a perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord, we create two right triangles, one on each side of the perpendicular, which have lengths from the circle's center to the midpoint of the chord equal to a certain radius. This concentric circle can be constructed using the formula for the distance from the center to the midpoint of the chord. 2. **Constructing the first auxiliary circle:** - Given a segment (AB), inscribe a chord in the first circle equal to (AB). Suppose the first circle is denoted as (omega_1), and its center as (O_1). - Let (CD) be a chord in (omega_1) such that (CD = AB). - The midpoint (M_1) of chord (CD) is at a distance ( sqrt{R_1^2 - (frac{AB}{2})^2} ) from the center (O_1), where (R_1) is the radius of (omega_1). - Draw the circle centered at (O_1) with radius (O_1M_1). This is the geometric place of all midpoints of chords in (omega_1) that are equal to (AB). 3. **Constructing the second auxiliary circle:** - Repeat the same steps for the second given circle, (omega_2), with center (O_2) and radius (R_2). Suppose the required chord in (omega_2) is equal to a given segment (CD). - Let (EF) be a chord in (omega_2) such that (EF = CD). - The midpoint (M_2) of chord (EF) is at a distance (sqrt{R_2^2 - (frac{CD}{2})^2}) from the center (O_2). - Draw the circle centered at (O_2) with radius (O_2M_2). 4. **Finding the common tangents:** - The task now is to find a line that is tangent to both of these auxiliary circles. Such a line will cut chords of the desired lengths in the given circles. - The external common tangents to these two auxiliary circles can be constructed using the methods of classical geometry. Essentially, if the two circles intersect, we find the external common tangent, otherwise, if they do not intersect, we compute the distance between the centers and use the radii to identify the tangents. 5. **Constructing the tangents:** - Identify and draw the tangents from one external point to the auxiliary circle on one side and from another external point to the other auxiliary circle. These tangents will form the sought lines. 6. **Conclusion:** - The line that is a common tangent to the two auxiliary circles is the required line. On this line, each of the original circles will cut chords equal to the given lengths (AB) and (CD). By following these steps, we have constructed the required line using a compass and straightedge.

If he wants to make a daily profit of 300 yuan by selling this fruit at a reduced price, how much should Manager Zhang reduce the selling price per kilogram?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Daily Sales Volume as a Function of Price Reduction Given that the base sales volume is 100 kilograms per day at a selling price of 4 yuan per kilogram, and for every 0.2 yuan decrease in selling price, an additional 40 kilograms can be sold. If the selling price is reduced by x yuan, the increase in sales volume can be calculated as follows: - The increase in sales volume per 0.2 yuan decrease in price is 40 kilograms. - Therefore, for a decrease of x yuan, the increase in sales volume is frac{x}{0.2} times 40 = 200x kilograms. Adding this increase to the base sales volume gives the total daily sales volume as a function of the price reduction x: text{Daily sales volume} = 100 + 200x Thus, the algebraic expression for the daily sales volume in terms of x is: boxed{100 + 200x} Part 2: Determining the Required Price Reduction for a 300 Yuan Daily Profit Manager Zhang has 500 yuan in funds and aims to achieve a daily profit of 300 yuan by selling the fruit at a reduced price. The cost price is 2 yuan per kilogram, and the initial selling price is 4 yuan per kilogram. If the selling price is reduced by x yuan, the new selling price becomes (4 - x) yuan per kilogram. The profit equation, considering the cost price and the desired profit, is: (4 - 2 - x)(100 + 200x) = 300 Simplifying the equation: (2 - x)(100 + 200x) = 300 Expanding and solving for x gives: 200 + 400x - 100x - 200x^2 = 300 200x - 200x^2 = 100 x^2 - x - frac{1}{2} = 0 Solving this quadratic equation, we find that x can be frac{1}{2} or 1. To determine which value of x allows for the purchase and sale of the fruit within the 500 yuan budget and achieves the desired profit, we calculate the sales volume for each value of x: - When x = frac{1}{2}, the sales volume is 100 + 200 times frac{1}{2} = 200 kilograms. - When x = 1, the sales volume is 100 + 200 times 1 = 300 kilograms. Given that Manager Zhang can purchase up to 250 kilograms of fruit with his 500 yuan budget (500 yuan / 2 yuan per kilogram), the feasible option that allows for achieving the desired profit within the budget constraints is when x = frac{1}{2}, as it requires purchasing 200 kilograms, which is less than the maximum of 250 kilograms he can afford.

Points not lying on the first diagonal break into pairs that are symmetric concerning the first diagonal. 2. **Analyzing Points Respect to Diagonals:** - The points that lie on the first diagonal but not in the center are symmetric concerning the second diagonal. - Therefore, for both diagonals, these points form pairs. 3. **Even-Odd Argument:** - The total number of points on the board is 25 (since it is a ( 25 times 25 ) board). - Points not on the first diagonal are in even number because they pair up symmetrically. - Similarly, points on the first diagonal but not in the center pair symmetrically with respect to the second diagonal. 4. **Count of Points:** - Since the total number of points is 25, which is an odd number, and the points not in the center pair symmetrically (even), there must be exactly one point that doesn't pair up — this point must be at the center of the board. 5. **Central Symmetry Argument:** - Another approach can be symmetry about both diagonals meaning the setup is symmetric about the central cell. - If the setup is symmetric and there is an odd number of checkers (25), one checker will land at the central cell to maintain this symmetry. # Conclusion: By combining both approaches, we can conclude that one of the checkers is necessarily placed in the central cell.

The oxide consists of an element and oxygen. The element has an atomic weight of 40.

Given: - Molecular weight of the oxide = 56 - Atomic weight of oxygen = 16 (since oxygen typically forms oxides in the form of O^2- ions, and the atomic weight of one oxygen atom is 16) Let's assume the formula of the oxide is EOx, where E is the element and x is the number of oxygen atoms. The molecular weight of the oxide (EOx) is the sum of the atomic weight of the element (E) and the atomic weight of oxygen (O) multiplied by the number of oxygen atoms (x): Molecular weight of EOx = Atomic weight of E + (Atomic weight of O * x) Given that the atomic weight of E is 40 and the molecular weight of the oxide is 56, we can write: 56 = 40 + (16 * x) Now we need to solve for x: 16x = 56 - 40 16x = 16 x = 1 This means there is one oxygen atom in the oxide. Therefore, the molecular weight of the oxide is the sum of the atomic weight of the element (40) and the atomic weight of one oxygen atom (16), which equals 56. Since we have determined that x = 1, the formula of the oxide is EO, where E is the element with an atomic weight of 40. The element with an atomic weight of boxed{40} is calcium (Ca).

Denote ( angle ADF = theta ). 2. **Calculate Segment (GH):** The length of (GH) can be expressed as the sum of the projections of the corridor widths onto the cart: [ GH = EH + EG = 1.5 left(frac{1}{sin theta} + frac{1}{cos theta}right) ] 3. **Calculate Segments (CH) and (BG):** The cart's width (CD) projects onto the extensions: [ CH = CD cdot cot theta = cot theta ] [ BG = AB cdot tan theta = tan theta ] 4. **Derive (AD):** Using the lengths calculated above, we can derive (AD) as follows: [ AD = GH - CH - BG ] [ AD = 1.5 left( frac{1}{sin theta} + frac{1}{cos theta} right) - cot theta - tan theta ] Simplify using trigonometric identities for tangent and cotangent: [ AD = 1.5 left( frac{1}{sin theta} + frac{1}{cos theta} right) - frac{cos theta}{sin theta} - frac{sin theta}{cos theta} ] 5. **Substitute (sin theta) and (cos theta) with a single variable:** Let (sin theta + cos theta = t), where (t in (1, sqrt{2}]).

Consider the numbers n!+1, n!+2, ldots, n!+n. 2. For 1 leq k leq n, note that n! is divisible by every integer from 1 to n. Hence, for each k, gcd(n!, n!+k) = gcd(n!, k) = k. This means k is the greatest common divisor of n! and n! + k. 3. Define m_k = frac{n! + k}{k} = frac{n!}{k} + 1. Notice that m_k is an integer. If the numbers m_k and n! are coprime (i.e., gcd(m_k, n!) = 1), let p_k be any prime divisor of m_k. Since p_k > n (as it cannot be a divisor of n! which includes all primes up to n), p_k cannot divide any other number in the set {n!+1, n!+2, ldots, n!+n} except n! + k. Therefore, we have found our required prime divisor in this case. 4. If m_k and n! share a common divisor, let p be one such prime divisor. - We know p mid n! and p mid m_k, so p mid (n! + k). - Since p mid n!, it must divide k. Therefore, k must be a multiple of p. Since there is at least one prime in the prime factorization of k> frac{n}{2}, we use p > frac{n}{2}. 5. In this case, choose p_k = k. Because p divides the selected number but cannot divide any other number in the set, no other n!+i for i in {1, 2, ldots, n} will include an integer factor of k greater than frac{n}{2} leq p_k. Conclusively, p_k = k satisfies the requirement as it does not divide any other number in the set except for n! + k. Hence, in either situation, each element in the set {n!+1, n!+2, ldots, n!+n} is guaranteed to have a prime factor distinct from the prime factors of other elements within the same set. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system, given points A(2,4) and B(6,2), with O being the origin.

The company plans to purchase a total of 20 robots of types A and B, and must ensure that the amount of goods carried per day is not less than 1820 tons. Based on the above requirements, determine how many robots of types A and B should be purchased, and what is the minimum cost required?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Determining the Amount of Goods Carried by Each Robot Let's denote the amount of goods carried per day by each A robot as x tons, and by each B robot as y tons. According to the given information, we can establish the following system of equations: 1. Each A robot carries 20 tons more goods than each B robot, which gives us the equation: x = y + 20. 2. Together, 3 A robots and 2 B robots carry 460 tons of goods per day, leading to the equation: 3x + 2y = 460. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: - From x = y + 20, we can express x in terms of y: x = y + 20. - Substituting x in 3x + 2y = 460, we have 3(y + 20) + 2y = 460. - Simplifying, 3y + 60 + 2y = 460 leads to 5y + 60 = 460. - Subtracting 60 from both sides, 5y = 400. - Dividing by 5, we find y = 80. Now, substituting y = 80 back into the equation x = y + 20, we get: - x = 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, each A robot carries boxed{100} tons of goods per day, and each B robot carries boxed{80} tons of goods per day. Part 2: Determining the Number of Robots to Purchase and the Minimum Cost Let m be the number of A robots purchased, and thus (20 - m) is the number of B robots purchased. The requirement is that the total amount of goods carried per day must not be less than 1820 tons, leading to the inequality: - 100m + 80(20 - m) geqslant 1820. Simplifying this inequality: - 100m + 1600 - 80m geqslant 1820, - 20m geqslant 220, - m geqslant 11. The total cost w in thousand yuan can be expressed as: - w = 30m + 20(20 - m), - Simplifying, w = 30m + 400 - 20m, - Further simplification gives w = 10m + 400. Since the cost increases with m, to minimize the cost, we choose the smallest possible value of m that satisfies the inequality, which is m = 11. Substituting m = 11 into the cost equation: - w = 10(11) + 400 = 110 + 400 = 510 thousand yuan.

Let alpha_n denote the smallest positive real number that such an integral can give. 1. **Symmetry Consideration**: For simplicity, let's consider even n. We take f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + cdots + c_n x^n. Due to symmetry, only even powers contribute to the integral, so we can consider f(x) = c_0 + c_2 x^2 + cdots + c_n x^n. 2. **Polynomial Representation**: We can represent f(x) as: f(x) = a (x^2 - x_0)(x^2 - x_2) cdots (x^2 - x_n), where x_0, x_2, ldots, x_n are the roots of the polynomial. 3. **Integral Transformation**: The integral becomes: int_{-1}^1 x^n f(x) , dx = 2a int_0^1 x^n (x^2 - x_0)(x^2 - x_2) cdots (x^2 - x_n) , dx. Let t = x^2, then dt = 2x , dx and the integral transforms to: a int_0^1 (1 - t)^{frac{n-1}{2}} (1 - x_0 - t)(1 - x_2 - t) cdots (1 - x_n - t) , dt. 4. **Heuristic Argument**: The integral reaches its minimum when x_0 = x_2 = cdots = x_n = 1. This is because (1 - t)^{frac{n-1}{2}} reaches a sharp maximum at t = 0, and t^{frac{n}{2}} has a sharp suppression at t = 0. 5. **Asymptotic Evaluation**: We evaluate the main asymptotic term when all the roots are different (x_0 neq x_2 neq cdots neq x_n): a int_0^1 (1 - t)^{frac{n-1}{2}} (1 - x_0 - t)(1 - x_2 - t) cdots (1 - x_n - t) , dt sim frac{2a e^{-frac{1}{2}}}{n-1} (1 - x_0)(1 - x_2) cdots (1 - x_n). 6. **Choosing a = pm 1**: To get a positive value of the integral, we choose a = pm 1: I_{min} = int_0^1 (1 - t)^{frac{n-1}{2}} t^{frac{n}{2}} , dt = Bleft(frac{n+1}{2}, frac{n}{2} + 1right), where B is the Beta function. 7. **Beta Function Representation**: Using the Beta function representation: Bleft(frac{n+1}{2}, frac{n}{2} + 1right) = frac{Gammaleft(frac{n+1}{2}right) Gammaleft(frac{n}{2} + 1right)}{Gammaleft(n + frac{3}{2}right)}. 8. **Gamma Function Simplification**: Using the duplication formula for the Gamma function: Gammaleft(frac{n}{2}right) Gammaleft(frac{n}{2} + frac{1}{2}right) = 2^{1-n} sqrt{pi} , Gamma(n), we get: I_{min}(n) = sqrt{pi} frac{n}{n + frac{1}{2}} frac{Gamma(n)}{Gammaleft(n + frac{1}{2}right)} frac{1}{2^n}. 9. **Stirling's Approximation**: Using Stirling's formula for large n: Gamma(n) sim sqrt{2 pi n} left(frac{n}{e}right)^n, we find: lim_{n to infty} frac{log left(I_{min}(n)right)}{n} = -log 2.

However, since the actual figure is not provided, I'll describe a general approach to solving such a problem. Assuming that the three views are the top view, front view, and side view: 1. **Identify the base area from the top view**: Let's say the base can be seen clearly from the top view. We would need to calculate the area of this base, which is usually a quadrilateral. If it's a rectangle, the area can be found using the formula A_text{base} = l times w, where l is the length and w is the width. 2. **Determine the height from the side or the front view**: The height (h) is typically seen in either of these views as the perpendicular distance from the base to the apex of the pyramid. 3. **Apply the formula for the volume of a pyramid**: Once you have the base area and the height, use the formula for the volume of a pyramid: V = frac{1}{3} A_text{base} times h Without the actual measurements from the views, we cannot calculate a numeric answer. But remember, once you have the base area and the height, you use the above formula and then box the final result. For example: - Suppose the base area (A_text{base}) is found to be 24 square units, - And the height (h) is 9 units, The volume (V) would be calculated as: V = frac{1}{3} A_text{base} times h V = frac{1}{3} times 24 times 9 V = 8 times 9 V = 72 So the volume of the pyramid is boxed{72} cubic units."},{"prompt":"A waiter had 47 customers to wait on.

Prove that the length of segment ( KL ) does not exceed the length of one of the diagonals.","completion":"1. **Set Up the Problem and Drawing Auxiliary Lines**: Consider the quadrilateral ABCD. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point P. Let KL be a segment passing through P with endpoints on AB and CD. 2. **Draw Perpendicular Lines**: We will draw lines perpendicular to KL through points K and L. These lines will intersect the sides of the quadrilateral at points A', B', C', and D'. Specifically, A' is the point where the perpendicular through K intersects AB, and B' is where the perpendicular through L intersects CD. Similarly, C' is where the perpendicular through K intersects AD, and D' is where the perpendicular through L intersects BC. 3. **Analyzing the Geometry and Constraints**: Assume for definiteness that the point A lies within the strip bounded by these perpendiculars, while point B is outside this strip. Consequently, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at P. 4. **Lengths Comparison**: The proof capitalizes on the alignment of the quadrilateral’s vertices. Given the setup: By geometric properties, the ratio of projections should hold as: [ frac{A A'}{B B'} leq frac{A_1 K}{B_1 K} = frac{C_1 L}{D_1 L} leq frac{C C'}{D D'} ] 5. **Argument by Contradiction**: Suppose instead that KL were longer than one of the diagonals, say BD. Because KL passes through the intersection point P of both AC and BD, and intersects AB and CD—both of which host the diagonal ends—such an intersection would force a geometric contradiction since the configuration would no longer support the quadrilateral. 6. **Final Conclusion**: Thus, we ensure that the segment KL does not exceed the length of the quadrilateral’s diagonals because maintaining the initial setup becomes geometrically impossible otherwise. [ boxed{} ] Therefore, the length of the segment KL does not exceed the length of any of the diagonals of quadrilateral ABCD."},{"prompt":"A large square is divided into a grid of 36 smaller equal squares, and a particular configuration in the grid shapes a shaded triangular region.

This forms two right triangles, each lying in half of the large square (assuming symmetry). - Calculate: The triangle consists of three smaller triangles in the grid made equal by symmetry. Each of these smaller triangles has a base and height equal to half of the smaller squares. Therefore, the area of one of these smaller triangles formed by the grid is half of a smaller square's area, or frac{1}{72} of the total area.

For instance, take the part split by diagonal (AC): - You have triangle (ASB), which is inside the square. - Also, you have triangle (ESB), which is part of the star. - The triangles (ASB) and (ESB) are similar and thus their areas relate in a fixed ratio. 4. **Determine the ratio of the areas:** - Since the line segments split the triangles proportionally and because the star's triangles are similar to each section's square triangle, the area of the triangle belonging to the square (ASB) is three times the area of the corresponding triangle on the star (ESB). 5. **Calculate the area of the star:** - The entire square's area is (72 text{ cm}^2). - The star's relative area within each divided section is one-third, since from each section composed of three parts (two small ones of the star and one small one of the square), only the star's part is retained. - Since there are four identical sections, the total area of the star is one-third of (72 text{ cm}^2): [ text{Area of the star} = frac{72 text{ cm}^2}{3} = 24 text{ cm}^2. ] 6. **Verify through the smallest unit areas (Optional Method):** - Compute the individual small grid square area: - The square’s total area is (72 text{ cm}^2), covering 18 small grid squares.

The problem is indeed about lattice points on the circumference of the circle, not inside the disk. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a circle with exactly ( n ) lattice points on its circumference for any given natural number ( n ). This is a non-trivial problem in number theory and geometry. 2. **Schinzel's Theorem**: Schinzel's theorem states that for any positive integer ( n ), there exists a circle with exactly ( n ) lattice points on its circumference. This theorem provides a theoretical guarantee of the existence of such circles. 3. **Non-constructive Proof**: The existence of a point ( P ) such that no two lattice points are equidistant from ( P ) can be shown non-constructively. Consider the family ( F ) of all possible perpendicular bisectors of segments ( XY ) where ( X ) and ( Y ) are lattice points. These lines are countably many. 4. **Countability Argument**: We claim that the lines in ( F ) cannot cover all points of the plane. Consider a circle ( C ). Any line from ( F ) intersects ( C ) in at most 2 points. Thus, the set of points where the lines from ( F ) intersect ( C ) is countable. However, the set of all points on ( C ) is uncountable. Therefore, there exists a point ( P in C ) that does not belong to any line in ( F ). 5. **Conclusion**: Since Schinzel's theorem guarantees the existence of such circles for any ( n ), and the countability argument shows that there are points not equidistant from any pair of lattice points, we conclude that for each natural number ( n ), there exists a circle with exactly ( n ) lattice points on its circumference.

Let's introduce the necessary notation for the events and follow the steps to compute the desired probability. 1. **Notation for Events:** Define the following events: - ( A ): The event that the gold coin is the asymmetric one. - ( B ): The event that when the gold coin was tossed, it immediately landed on heads, and when the silver coin was tossed, heads came up only on the second try. 2. **Bayes' Theorem:** We need to find the conditional probability ( mathrm{P}(A mid B) ).

So ( mathrm{P}(text{heads on first toss}) = 0.6 ). The silver coin, being symmetric, has a probability of ( 0.5 ) for heads on each toss, so getting heads on the second try happens with probability ( 0.5 times 0.5 = 0.25 ). Therefore, [ mathrm{P}(B mid A) = 0.6 times 0.25 = 0.15 ] - If the gold coin is symmetric (( bar{A} )), it lands on heads with probability ( 0.5 ) (usual case for symmetric coins). Getting heads on the second try with the silver coin again gives the same probability: [ mathrm{P}(B mid bar{A}) = 0.5 times 0.25 = 0.125 ] Now, we need ( mathrm{P}(B) ), which can be computed as a total probability, combining both possibilities (gold coin being asymmetric or symmetric): [ mathrm{P}(B) = mathrm{P}(B mid A) cdot mathrm{P}(A) + mathrm{P}(B mid bar{A}) cdot mathrm{P}(bar{A}) ] Substitute the known values: [ mathrm{P}(B) = (0.15 cdot 0.5) + (0.125 cdot 0.5) = 0.075 + 0.0625 = 0.1375 ] 4. **Substitute Back in Bayes' Formula**: We now substitute all these values into Bayes' theorem: [ mathrm{P}(A mid B) = frac{0.15 cdot 0.5}{0.1375} = frac{0.075}{0.1375} = frac{75}{137.5} ] Simplify the fraction: [ frac{75}{137.5} = frac{75 times 10}{137.5 times 10} = frac{750}{1375} = frac{30}{55} = frac{6}{11} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{6}{11}} ]"},{"prompt":"Jeremy strolled 20 kilometers at 2 kilometers per hour.

Assuming our 17 primes do not include 3, their squares modulo 3 would each be 1. Summing these up: [ 17 times 1 equiv 2 (text{mod} 3) ] This implies that the sum cannot be a perfect square modulo 3 (since (0) or (1) squares modulo 3 are (0) or (1)), ruling out the scenario without the prime number 3. 3. **Inclusion of the Prime Number 3:** Given that the sum must be a perfect square, our set of 17 prime numbers must include 3. Hence, this smallest prime in our list is either 2 or 3. 4. **Analyzing the Implications with Prime 2:** The inclusion of 2 as a smallest prime: To check divisibility, if the two largest primes are ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ): [ p_1^2 - p_2^2 = (p_1 - p_2)(p_1 + p_2) ] We are required to check this product’s divisibility by 2.

Thus, the statement holds true given distinct primes. 5. **Analyzing the Implications with Prime 3:** Let's consider if 3 is the smallest prime in the set: According to the assumption (*) above, if 3 is there, excluding 2, based on the division results, we focus on the differences: To check divisibility, if the two largest primes are ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ): [ p_1^2 - p_2^2 = (p_1 - p_2)(p_1 + p_2) ] This value should be checked for divisibility by 3. This fails if one of ( p_1 ) or ( p_2 ) is divisible by 3. Possible primes, opposed to all being as we include 3, are scenarios outlined here which aren't contradictory as long pairs satisfy modulo constraints. 6. **Conclusion on Divisibility:** If all distinct primes scenarios (not all identical or lamest cases), divisibility statements bring conclusions correct: [ mathbf{Conclusion:} ] Every combination of distinct primes fits, which rules equations in modular setups confirmed such: If sum squares are perfect, ( k ) values also, conclude verified that the largest differences include such scenarios.

For ( n = 1 ): [ 5^1 = 5, ] - Sum of digits of 5 is 5. [ 2^1 = 2. ] - Thus, ( 5 neq 2 ). For ( n = 2 ): [ 5^2 = 25, ] - Sum of digits of 25 is ( 2 + 5 = 7 ). [ 2^2 = 4. ] - Thus, ( 7 neq 4 ). For ( n = 3 ): [ 5^3 = 125, ] - Sum of digits of 125 is ( 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 ). [ 2^3 = 8. ] - Thus, ( 8 = 8 ). - So ( n = 3 ) is a solution. For ( n = 4 ): [ 5^4 = 625, ] - Sum of digits of 625 is ( 6 + 2 + 5 = 13 ). [ 2^4 = 16. ] - Thus, ( 13 neq 16 ). For ( n = 5 ): [ 5^5 = 3125, ] - Sum of digits of 3125 is ( 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 11 ).

The number ( 5^n ) at most can be an ( n)-digit number since: [ 5^n < 10^n .] Thus, the sum of the digits of ( 5^n ) is at most ( 9n ) (since the highest sum of digits per digit is 9). - On the other hand, we also evaluate: [ 2^n geq 9n. ] - Let's check this for ( n = 6 ): [ 2^6 = 64, ] [ 9 times 6 = 54. ] - Clearly, ( 64 geq 54 ). - For larger ( n ), say ( n+1 ), the inequality ( 2^n geq 9n ) grows stronger as the exponentiation increases faster than linear and addition: [ 2^{n+1} = 2 times 2^n geq 2 times 9n = 18n, ] while, [ 9(n+1) = 9n + 9, ] - Thus, ( 18n geq 9n + 9 ) for any ( n geq 1 ), ensuring the exponential growth outpaces the linear growth with each increment.

Determine the symmetric point of M with respect to (2,1). Taking (2,1) as the center of symmetry, the coordinates of the image point N can be obtained by reflecting the point M over the center.

Also, prove that for any n geq 6, n neq 7, there exists a polyhedron with n edges.","completion":": 1. **Proof that a convex polyhedron cannot have seven edges.** Firstly, consider if all faces of the convex polyhedron are triangles. In such a case, the number of edges must be a multiple of 3 because each triangular face has 3 edges, and each edge is shared by two faces. Hence, the total number of edges (E) must satisfy: [ E = 3n / 2 ] where (n) represents the number of triangular faces. Since we are looking to have seven edges, this calculation gives a non-integer value. Next, consider if there is at least one face of the polyhedron which is a polygon with more than three sides. The minimum number of edges (E) in such a scenario cannot be smaller than 8. This is because the simplest convex polyhedron with a non-triangular face is a pyramid with a quadrilateral base, having a total of: [ 4 text{ (edges of the base)} + 4 text{ (edges connecting apex to the base vertices)} = 8 text{ edges}. ] Therefore, regardless of whether all faces are triangular or not, it is impossible for a convex polyhedron to have exactly seven edges. 2. **Proof that for any ( n geq 6 ) and ( n neq 7 ), there exists a polyhedron with ( n ) edges.** - For even ( n ) such that ( n = 2k ) and ( k geq 3 ): Consider a pyramid with a ( k )-sided polygon base. This polyhedron will have: [ k text{ (edges of the base)} + k text{ (edges from the apex to each vertex of the base)} = 2k text{ edges}. ] Hence, a ( k )-sided polygonal pyramid has ( 2k ) edges. - For odd ( n ) such that ( n = 2k + 3 ) and ( k geq 3 ): Consider a polyhedron derived from a pyramid with a ( k )-sided polygon base by truncating one vertex (cutting off with an additional triangular face). This polyhedron will have: [ k text{ (initial base edges)} + k text{ (edges from the apex to each vertex of the base)} + 3 text{ (additional edges from the truncated vertex)} = 2k + 3 text{ edges}. ] Therefore, this process creates a polyhedron with ( 2k + 3 ) edges, providing flexibility for creating polyhedra with an odd number of edges greater than or equal to 9. 3. **Conclusion.** Thus, we conclude that a convex polyhedron cannot have exactly seven edges. Additionally, for any ( n geq 6 ) and ( n neq 7 ), there exists a convex polyhedron having ( n ) edges.

Let's consider triangle ABC, where angle angle BAC is divided into three equal parts by lines that intersect the side BC at points A_1 and A_2. - Denote the angles as follows: angle BAC = alpha, angle BAA_1 = alpha/3, angle A_1AA_2 = alpha/3, and angle A_2AC = alpha/3. - It is given that A_2 lies between A_1 and C. 2. Take the lines AA_1 and AA_2. We know that either angle AA_1A_2 or angle AA_2A_1 must be acute. Without loss of generality, assume angle AA_2A_1 is acute. 3. Reflect the point A_1 across the line AA_2 to form point D on segment AC. - By properties of reflection, A_2D = A_2A_1. 4. Now consider triangle A_2CD. The angle at D is angle CDA_2. - By angle sum in a triangle: angle CDA_2 = 180^circ - angle ADA_2 = 180^circ - angle AA_1A_2. - Since angle AA_1A_2 is an exterior angle of triangle AA_1C: [ angle AA_1A_2 = angle BAC - angle AA_1C ] Hence, angle AA_1A_2 > angle ACA_2 since angle ACA_2 is one of the internal, non-adjacent angles of triangle AA_1C. 5. Therefore, sides opposite to larger angles are larger: [ CA_2 > A_2D = A_2A_1 ] Hence, the resulting three segments, BA_1, A_1A_2, A_2C, cannot be equal. b) Checking if Middle Segment is Always Smallest 1. Suppose angle AA_1A_2 > 90^circ, meaning angle AA_1B is acute. 2. In the earlier consideration, replace A_1 with B, A_2 with A_1, and C with A_2: - Thus: A_2A_1 > A_1B, and hence the segment B A_1 < A_1A_2. 3. To determine if the other angle conditions can affect the middle segment's size: - Calculate angle AA_1B = 180^circ - angle ABC - frac{1}{3} angle BAC. - If angle ABC + frac{1}{3} angle BAC > 90^circ, then the middle segment (A_1A_2) isn't necessarily the smallest. - Similar logic applies if angle ACB + frac{1}{3} angle BAC > 90^circ. 4. Hence, only the cases where none of these inequalities hold would mean that the middle segment is not larger than any end segment.

Shooters A and B take turns firing a six-shot revolver with a single bullet. Shooter A always goes first. We need to determine the probability that the shot occurs when the revolver is with A. 2. To set up the situation mathematically, observe the following: - The probability that A fires the bullet on the first shot is ( frac{1}{6} ). - If A does not fire the bullet (with probability ( frac{5}{6} )), then B takes a turn. The probability that B does not fire the bullet either is also ( frac{5}{6} ). In this case, the revolver returns to A, and the situation repeats itself. 3. Therefore, the probability that A will eventually fire the bullet can be expressed as: [ P_A = frac{1}{6} + left( frac{5}{6} cdot frac{5}{6} cdot P_A right) ] This takes into account the first shot plus the probability of proceeding to subsequent cycles without firing the bullet. 4.

The change in f(x) from x_1 to x_2 is given by: [ f(x_1) - f(x_2) = frac{x_1}{1+x_1^2} - frac{x_2}{1+x_2^2} = frac{(x_1-x_2)(1-x_1x_2)}{(1+x_1^2)(1+x_2^2)} ] Since -1 < x_1 < x_2 < 1, we have: - x_1 - x_2 < 0 - 1 - x_1x_2 > 0 - 1 + x_1^2 > 0 - 1 + x_2^2 > 0 Thus, the numerator and the denominator of the fraction are both positive, which implies that: [ f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0 text{or} f(x_1) < f(x_2) ] Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-1,1): [ boxed{text{Monotonically Increasing on } (-1,1)} ] # Part 3: Solve the Inequality f(t+1) + f(2t) < 0 Given the condition: [ f(t+1) < -f(2t) = f(-2t) ] We need to find the values of t that satisfy: 1. -1 < t+1 < 1 2. -1 < 2t < 1 3. t+1 < -2t Solving these inequalities gives us: 1. -2 < t < 0 2. -frac{1}{2} < t < frac{1}{2} 3. t < -frac{1}{3} The intersection of these conditions provides: [ boxed{-frac{1}{2} < t < -frac{1}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let p=cosalphacosbeta, q=cos^2left(frac{alpha+beta}{2}right), then the relationship between p and q is ______.","completion":"Solution: p-q=cosalphacosbeta- frac{cos(alpha+beta)+1}{2} = frac{cos(alpha-beta)-1}{2} leq 0.

How old are they now?","completion":"1. Let the year of birth be denoted by overline{abcd}, where a, b, c, and d are digits. 2. The problem states that the age of Andrey and Kolya in December of last year (2021) is equal to the sum of the digits of their birth year. This can be written as: [ 2021 - overline{abcd} = a + b + c + d ] 3. Rearrange this equation to express overline{abcd} in terms of a, b, c, and d: [ overline{abcd} = 2021 - (a + b + c + d) ] 4. Notice that overline{abcd} is the numeric representation of the digits a, b, c, and d. Therefore, we can also write it as: [ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = overline{abcd} ] 5. Combining both equations, we have: [ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 2021 - (a + b + c + d) ] 6. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + a + b + c + d = 2021 ] [ 1001a + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2021 ] 7. Now, we need to find values for a, b, c, and d that satisfy this equation and also correspond to a valid year of birth. We start by testing possible values for a. 8. **Case a = 2**: [ 1001(2) + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2021 ] [ 2002 + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2021 ] [ 101b + 11c + 2d = 2021 - 2002 ] [ 101b + 11c + 2d = 19 ] 9. Since b, c, and d are digits (0-9), and the sum must be 19, we need to find suitable values for b, c, and d. Consider b = 0: [ 101(0) + 11c + 2d = 19 ] [ 11c + 2d = 19 ] 10. Testing values, we find: If c = 1: [ 11(1) + 2d = 19 ] [ 11 + 2d = 19 ] [ 2d = 8 ] [ d = 4 ] Thus, overline{abcd} = 2014. 11. **Case a = 1**: [ 1001(1) + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2021 ] [ 1001 + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2021 ] [ 101b + 11c + 2d = 1020 ] 12. Since b, c, and d are digits (0-9), and their sum must be 1020, we need to find suitable values for b, c, and d. Consider b = 9: [ 101(9) + 11c + 2d = 1020 ] [ 909 + 11c + 2d = 1020 ] [ 11c + 2d = 111 ] 13.

Each corner of the octagon corresponds to where a mat touches the table border. 2. **Side Length of Octagon**: The circle’s circumference is 2pi times 5 = 10pi feet. The arc between two adjacent touch points on the circle is frac{10pi}{8} = 1.25pi feet. The corresponding chord, which is the side length of the octagon, is calculated using the chord formula 2R sin(theta/2) where theta is the angle between two radii to the touch points. Since an octagon segments the circle into 8 equal parts, theta = frac{2pi}{8} = frac{pi}{4}. Thus, the chord length is 2 times 5 sin(frac{pi}{8}). 3. **Calculating sin(frac{pi}{8})**: Using double angle identities, sin(frac{pi}{8}) = sqrt{frac{1 - cos(frac{pi}{4})}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} = sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{4}}.

Each tromino covers exactly three cells. Our goal is to demonstrate that the number of ways to accomplish this is divisible by 8. 2. **Properties of L-shaped trominos**: Each tromino consists of a 1x2 rectangle (or a 2x1 rectangle) attached to one additional cell perpendicularly. There are four rotations of this shape. 3. **Initial observation**: - The total area of the (999 times 999) grid is (999^2). - Since the grid is to be completely covered by L-shaped trominos and each tromino covers exactly 3 cells, the total number of trominos required is (frac{999^2}{3}). - This must be an integer, which implies (999^2) must be divisible by 3, which it is because (999 equiv 0 pmod{3}). 4. **Symmetry and tiling**: - We will employ symmetry properties of the grid and trominos to determine the divisibility by 8. - Observe that the side length of the grid, 999, is one less than 1000, a power of 10. Hence (999 equiv -1 pmod{4}). 5. **Partitioning strategy**: - Consider a smaller cozy problem, partitioning a (2 times 2) square. There are too few cells for this and (2 times 2) won’t suffice. - Analyze larger even-sized grids (2^k times 2^k): - For any (2^k times 2^k) grid, since it can be subdivided into four (2^{k-1} times 2^{k-1}) grids, and systematically tiled with L-shaped trominos, each intact grid is divisible by 8. 6. **General case for (999 times 999)**: - Use symmetric properties and complete binary division from the central cells moving outward. - **Key insight**: If you can prove any symmetry within specific partitioning, it will carry over for an odd large number. - We also observe invariant properties under rotation and reflection: - There are 8 symmetric ways (4 rotations + 4 reflections about axes). - For a symmetry consideration (e.g., central cell or edges), rotations provide no new arrangement proving invariant modulo symmetries. 7. **Counting distinct partitions**: - Each distinct way can be rotated and reflected to provide another unique way (given inherent symmetry by 8). - Hence, [ text{Total ways} equiv 0 pmod{8} quad text{(by symmetry and modulus conservation)} ] 8. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{The number of ways to dissect the } 999 times 999 text{ grid into L-shaped trominos is divisible by 8}} ] Thus, using structural symmetry arguments and modular constraints, we conclude that the total dissections form equivalence by 8.

Given that the length of the train is 300 m and the length of the platform is approximately 600 m (since 600.0000000000001 m is practically 600 m when considering significant figures for this context), the total distance covered is: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 300 m + 600 m Total distance = 900 m The train covers this distance in 54 seconds.

Since the new set of numbers are the same as the original set: [ (a-1) + (b+1) + c^2 = a + b + c ] 6. Simplifying the equation: [ a - 1 + b + 1 + c^2 = a + b + c ] [ a + b + c^2 = a + b + c ] 7.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Periodicity of the Function:** - From the given f(x+2) = 2 - f(x), we can deduce that f(x+2) + f(x) = 2. This implies that for every x, the sum of f(x) and f(x+2) equals 2. - Extending this, we can say f(x+4) + f(x+2) = 2. Substituting the original equation into this, we find that f(x+4) = f(x). This indicates that the function f(x) is periodic with a period T=4. 2. **Symmetry and Values of the Function:** - Given that f(2-3x) is an even function, we have f(2-3x) = f(2+3x). This shows that the function exhibits symmetry about x=2. - Consequently, f(1) = f(3), and from the periodicity and given equations, f(1) + f(3) = 2. Thus, we can conclude f(1) = f(3) = 1. 3. **Calculating Specific Function Values:** - Knowing f(0) = 0 and combining this with f(x+2) + f(x) = 2, we find f(2) = 2. - Since f(4) = f(0) = 0, we can calculate the sum of the function values over one period: f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 4. 4. **Determining the Value of n:** - The total sum given is 123, which can be broken down into 30 periods of the function (since 30 times 4 = 120) plus the partial sum of the next period up to f(2), because 123 = 30 times 4 + 3. - Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n{f(k)} = 123 = 30 times 4 + f(1) + f(2), which implies that the sequence must include complete periods plus the first two terms of the next period, leading to n = 122.

According to the problem, A_{ m n} = (1 - 0.2)A_{ m n-1} + 0.3(1000 - A_{ m n-1}), which simplifies to 2A_{ m n} = A_{ m n} + 600. This implies that 2(A_{ m n} - 600) = (A_{ m n-1} - 600). Thus, frac {A_{n}-600}{A_{n-1}-600}= frac {1}{2}, indicating that {A_{ m n} - 600} is a geometric sequence with the first term (A_{ m 1} - 600) and a common ratio of frac {1}{2}. Consequently, A_{ m n} - 600 = (A_{1}-600)×( frac {1}{2})^{n-1}, and A_{ m n} = 600 + frac {A_{1}-600}{2^{n-1}}.

Solving this equation gives c=-2 or c=-6. If c=-2, then f′(x)=0 gives x=-2 or x=-frac{2}{3}. Since f(x) has a negative derivative to the left of x=-2 and a positive derivative to the right of x=-2, f(x) has a maximum value at x=-2. If c=-6, then f′(x)=0 gives x=-6 or x=-2.

The given problem is to find the sum ( A ) of all non-negative integers ( n ) satisfying: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{27} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{28} rightrfloor ] 2.

Suppose ( n = aq + r ) where ( 0 leq r < a ). Then: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{a} rightrfloor = q ] and since ( n = (a+1)q + r - q = q(a + 1 - 1) + r = q a + r ), we have: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{a+1} rightrfloor = q ] This condition requires: [ 0 leq r - q < a+1 ] 4. Rearranging, we get: [ q leq r < a ] 5. For each ( q ) ranging from ( 0 ) to ( a-1 ), ( r ) can take any value from ( q ) to ( a-1 ). The total number of solutions is thus: [ sum_{q=0}^{a-1} sum_{r=q}^{a-1} (qa + r) ] 6. This can be expanded: [ A = sum_{q=0}^{a-1} sum_{r=q}^{a-1} (qa + r) ] 7.

Using the Cosine Theorem for ( a^2, b^2 ) and ( c^2 ), we combine the respective equations with angles of 120°: [ 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (xy + yz + zx) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2. ] 8.

Combining and simplifying, we obtain: [ 2(x + y + z)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 4S sqrt{3}. ] 11.

Since w and y are prime, the prime factorization of 2wy is simply 2 * w * y. The number of factors of a number is determined by taking the exponents in its prime factorization, adding 1 to each, and then multiplying these numbers together. For 2wy, the prime factorization is 2^1 * w^1 * y^1. To find the number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent and multiply: (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

For set M, the inequality x^2 - 2008x - 2009 > 0 represents a parabola that opens upwards. The roots of the corresponding quadratic equation x^2 - 2008x - 2009 = 0 will be the boundary points of the intervals where the parabola is above the x-axis. To factor the quadratic, notice that: (x - 2009)(x + 1) = x^2 - 2008x - 2009 Thus, the roots are x = 2009 and x = -1. Between the roots, the inequality x^2 - 2008x - 2009 > 0 does not hold, and outside of the roots, it holds. Therefore, set M is the union of the intervals (-infty, -1) and (2009, +infty). For set N, we have the quadratic inequality x^2 + ax + b leq 0. Since M cup N = mathbb{R}, it follows that the quadratic polynomial x^2 + ax + b must be non-positive in the intervals we found for M's complement, which are [-1, 2009]. As M cap N = (2009, 2010], the quadratic polynomial must change sign at x = 2009 and remain non-positive until x = 2010, then become positive afterward. Therefore, x = 2009 must be a root of the quadratic x^2 + ax + b = 0, giving us: 2009^2 + 2009a + b = 0 Another condition is x = 2010 must not be a root of the equation but for x just slightly larger than 2010, the inequality x^2 + ax + b > 0 must hold again. So, the quadratic must have a maximum point at x = 2010, and thus x = 2010 is a critical point. For the maximum, the first derivative of x^2 + ax + b with respect to x must equal to zero at x = 2010: 2x + a = 0 2(2010) + a = 0 a = -4020 To get b, replace a with -4020 in the equation we found by considering x = 2009 as a root: (2009)^2 - 4020(2009) + b = 0 b = 4020(2009) - (2009)^2 b = 2009(4020 - 2009) b = 2009(2011) Now we need to choose between the options based on the value of b that we got: 2009(2011) = 2009(2009 + 2) = 2009^2 + 2(2009) Since 2009^2 will go away because it will cancel out due to the root condition, we get: b = 2(2009) b = 4018 As none of the given options presents a = -4020 and b = 4018, there might be a mistake in the initial options provided. Let's reevaluate a and b with respect to the options given. For M cap N to be (2009, 2010], 2009 must be a root, which implies a is certainly 2009, and b should be such that x^2 + 2009x + b <= 0 for x in the interval, and x = 2010 will be the point where the quadratic starts being positive again. The conditions are: At x = 2009: (2009)^2 + 2009a + b = 0 At x = 2010: (2010)^2 + 2009(2010) + b > 0 Replacing a = 2009 in the first condition, we get: (2009)^2 + 2009(2009) + b = 0 b = -2009^2 - 2009(2009) b = -2009(2009 + 1) b = -2009(2010) Hence, we have a = 2009 and b = -2009(2010).

We must show that (frac{a cdot p + b cdot n}{b cdot p}) is a rational number. - Since (a, b, n,) and (p) are integers, the product of any two integers is also an integer. Hence, (a cdot p) and (b cdot n) are integers. - The sum of two integers is also an integer, so (a cdot p + b cdot n) is an integer. - The product of two integers is an integer, so (b cdot p) is an integer. - Since (b neq 0) and (p neq 0), their product (b cdot p neq 0). Therefore, the fraction (frac{a cdot p + b cdot n}{b cdot p}) is a quotient of two integers, with a non-zero denominator, which means it is a rational number. 3.

A bee moves from node ( A ) to node ( B ) along the shortest path comprised of 100 line segments. We need to show that the bee traverses 50 line segments in one direction and 50 line segments in the other two directions combined. 1. **Understanding the Grid and Directions**: In a honeycomb grid, there are three distinct directions for any line segment. These directions can be considered as: - Horizontal (let's call it direction 1) - Two diagonal directions forming an angle with the horizontal (let's call them direction 2 and direction 3). 2. **Shortest Path in Honeycomb Grid**: The shortest path between two points involves moving along the edges of the hexagons in a way that minimizes the total distance. In a regular grid, each move between two nodes can be conceived as a unit length move. 3. **Formulating the Path**: Since every step taken by the bee is of unit length and the total path length is 100, with three directions available, we break the path into moves along these directions. Let ( x_1 ), ( x_2 ), and ( x_3 ) be the number of unit segments traveled in direction 1, direction 2, and direction 3 respectively. The condition given is: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 100 ] 4. **Optimal Path and Equidistant Segments**: For the bee to follow the shortest path, it must travel equally in pairs of directly opposing directions. That is, moving forward in one direction and coming back in another. Hence, the moves in opposite directions cancel each other out partially. 5. **Berry’s Distribution**: Traditionally, for any regular path like this through a hexagonal grid: [ x_1 = x_2 + x_3 ] Given that the total number of segments is 100, and the segments in any single direction must sum up to half the total since any two other combined give the remainder: [ x_1 = 50 ] and [ x_2 + x_3 = 50 ] This shows that the bee must travel precisely 50 segments in one direction and 50 segments distributed between the remaining two directions. 6. **Drawing and Verification**: Drawing a large honeycomb grid manually and tracing shortest paths between pairs of nodes distanced by about 8-10 hexagons can visually confirm our formulation.

Frank composes 30 problems of each type, and since there are 4 types, the total number of problems Frank composes is 30 * 4 = 120 problems. Since Frank composes 3R problems, we can set up the equation 3R = 120 to find the number of problems Ryan composes. Solving for R gives us R = 120 / 3 = 40 problems.

At each step, we are allowed to replace a point with its symmetric image with respect to one of the other points. Can we reach the 8th vertex in this way?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Notation** Suppose we start with the 7 vertices of a cube, each represented by their coordinates in a 3-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system. Specifically, we have the vertices: [ (0,0,0), , (0,0,1), , (0,1,0), , (1,0,0), , (1,1,0), , (0,1,1), , (1,0,1) ] 2. **Transformation Rule** When replacing a point ( (x,y,z) ) by its symmetric point with respect to another point ( (a,b,c) ), the coordinates transform as follows: [ (x,y,z) rightarrow (x + 2(a-x), y + 2(b-y), z + 2(c-z)) ] Simplifying this, the new coordinates are: [ (2a-x, 2b-y, 2c-z) ] 3. **Integral Coordinates** Observe that all provided points have integer coordinates. When conducting the symmetry transformation, since ( x, y, z, a, b, ), and ( c ) are all integers, the new coordinates ( 2a - x, 2b - y, 2c - z ) will always be integers. Hence, the newly obtained point will also have integer coordinates. 4. **Preserving Parity** Next, we need to examine how the parity of each coordinate is affected. Let's consider the parity (even or odd nature) of the coordinates: - ( x ), ( y ), ( z ) – each can be either even (0) or odd (1) - ( a ), ( b ), ( c ) – each can also be either even (0) or odd (1) Recall the expression for the new coordinates: ( (2a - x, 2b - y, 2c - z) ). Focus on the parity of each coordinate: - If ( a ) is even and ( x ) is odd, ( 2a - x = even - odd = odd ) - If ( a ) is odd and ( x ) is even, ( 2a - x = odd - even = odd ) - If both ( a ) and ( x ) have the same parity, ( 2a - x ) will also keep the same parity (even–even = even or odd–odd = odd). From this, we notice that the parity of each transformed coordinate ( 2a - x ) continues to follow the parity properties of the original and reference points. 5. **Impossibility of Certain Coordinates** Given the initial set of vertices: [ (0,0,0), , (0,0,1), , (0,1,0), , (1,0,0), , (1,1,0), , (0,1,1), , (1,0,1) ] We observe: - There is no point among them with all three coordinates odd. - The parity of coordinates ensures that any point obtained through the symmetry operation will continue to have at least one even coordinate. 6. **Conclusion** Since we cannot obtain a point with all three coordinates being odd through the symmetry operation starting from any of the initial 7 vertices, it means that we cannot reach the vertex ( (1,1,1) ) whose coordinates are all odd.

According to the given conditions, we find a and b and thus obtain the result. **Solution** (1) Since the point B(1,0) is symmetric to point C across x=2, the coordinates of C are (1,4), Therefore, the reflected ray passes through points B and C, where B(0,2), Therefore, the slope k_{BC}=2, Therefore, the equation of line BC is: y-2=2(x-0), That is: 2x-y+2=0, Hence, the answer is 2x-y+2=0; (2) Since y=2sin left(2x- frac{pi}{3}right) is increasing in its interval, Therefore, 2kpi- frac{pi}{2}leqslant 2x- frac{pi}{3}leqslant 2kpi+ frac{pi}{2},(kinmathbb{Z}), Therefore, kpi- frac{pi}{12}leqslant xleqslant kpi+ frac{5pi}{12}, Hence, the answer is left[kpi- frac{pi}{12},kpi+ frac{5pi}{12}right]; (3) Since f(x)=-f(x+ frac{3}{2}), Therefore, f(x+3)=fleft[left(x+ frac{3}{2}right)+ frac{3}{2}right]=-f(x+ frac{3}{2})=f(x), Therefore, f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 3, Since the graph of function f(x) is symmetric about the point left(- frac{3}{4},0right), Therefore, f(x)=-f(-x- frac{3}{2}), Since f(x)=-f(x+ frac{3}{2}), Therefore, f(x+ frac{3}{2})=fleft[-(x+ frac{3}{2})right], Therefore, f(x)=-f(x), Therefore, f(x) is an even function defined on mathbb{R}, Since f(-1)=1, f(0)=-2, Therefore, f(1)=f(-1)=f(2)=1, Therefore, f(3k)=-2, f(3k+1)=1, f(3k+2)=1, (kinmathbb{Z}), Therefore, f(1)+f(2)+ldots+f(2010)=0. Hence, the answer is boxed{0}; (4) Since f(x)=|2^{x}-1|, Therefore, f(x)geqslant 0, Since the range is [a,b], Therefore, ageqslant 0, Since the domain is [a,b], Therefore, xgeqslant 0, Therefore, f(x)=|2^{x}-1|=2^{x}-1, which is monotonically increasing in its domain, Therefore, begin{cases}f(a)=2^{a}-1=a f(b)=2^{b}-1=bend{cases}, Therefore, a,b are the roots of the equation 2^{x}-1=x, Since the intersection points of y=2^{x}-1 and y=x are (0,0) and (1,1), Therefore, a=0, b=1, Therefore, a+b=1. Hence, the answer is boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"Determine the twin prime numbers ( p ) and ( q ) for which ( p^2 pq + q^2 ) is also a prime.

To express overrightarrow{AD} in terms of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC}, we use the fact that overrightarrow{AD}=overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{BD} and overrightarrow{BD}=frac{2}{3}overrightarrow{BC}, since frac{BD}{BD+DC}=frac{2}{2+1}=frac{2}{3}. 6. Substituting overrightarrow{BC}=overrightarrow{AC}-overrightarrow{AB} into the expression for overrightarrow{AD}, we get: [ overrightarrow{AD}=overrightarrow{AB}+frac{2}{3}(overrightarrow{AC}-overrightarrow{AB})=frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{AB}+frac{2}{3}overrightarrow{AC} ] 7.

Hence ( Q(x) equiv Q(c-x) ) for some constant ( c in mathbb{Z} ). **Proof of Lemma:** - Without loss of generality, assume the leading coefficient of ( Q ) is positive; otherwise, change ( Q to -Q ). - Choose constants ( M, K, N in mathbb{Z}_{> 0} ) such that both sequences [ Q(M), Q(M+1), Q(M+2), ldots quad text{and} quad Q(-M), Q(-M-1), Q(-M-2), ldots ] are strictly increasing. - Also, choose ( K ) such that [ Q(x) - Q(N-x) > 0 quad forall , x ge K quad text{and} quad Q(x) - Q(-N-x) < 0 quad forall , x ge K. ] - By changing ( M to max(M, K) ), we can assume ( M ge K ). - Define the sets [ S_1 = {M, M+1, M+2, ldots} quad text{and} quad S_2 = {-M, -M-1, -M-2, ldots}. ] - All elements of ( Q(S_1) ) and ( Q(S_2) ) are distinct. - For infinitely many pairs ( (x, y) ) with ( Q(x) = Q(y) ), one of ( x, y ) is in ( S_1 + K ) while the other is in ( S_2 ). - For any ( x in S_1 + K ), the element ( y in S_2 ) for which ( Q(x) = Q(y) ) must satisfy [ y in (-N-x, N-x). ] - Thus, ( x + y ) can take only finitely many values. So there is a constant ( c ) such that for infinitely many pairs ( (x, y) ), we have ( x + y = c ) and ( Q(x) = Q(y) = Q(c-x) ). - Therefore, the polynomial [ Q(x) - Q(c-x) ] has infinitely many roots and hence is identically zero. This proves our Lemma. (square) 2. **Application of Lemma to ( P(x) ):** - Consider ( Q(x) = xP(x) ). By the lemma, for some ( c in mathbb{Z} ), we have [ xP(x) equiv (c-x)P(c-x). ] - If ( c ne 0 ), then setting ( x = c ) gives [ P(c) = 0. ] - If ( c = 0 ), then [ xP(x) equiv -xP(-x) quad text{or} quad P text{ is odd}. ] - In this case, ( P(0) = 0 ), completing the proof.

Let (q) be a prime divisor of (a). - If (q leq b), then (q mid a^p - b! = p), implying (q = p). 3. **Considering (b < p)**: If (b < p), then any prime divisor (q) of (a) must satisfy (q > b). Hence, because (q mid a), we have (a geq q > b). Using this insight, we use properties involving inequalities: [ begin{aligned} b! + p &= a^p &geq (b+1)^p &> b^p + p cdot b^{p-1}, end{aligned} ] where the last step follows from the binomial expansion and (p geq 2). 4. **Contradiction**: This implies (b^b < b!), which is a contradiction since (b! = prod_{k=1}^b k) and each term (k leq b) in the product. Hence, we cannot have (b < p). Thus, (b geq p). 5. **Prime Divisors and Divisibility**: Since (b geq p), every prime divisor of (a) is (geq p) and (p mid a^p). So (p) must divide (a). 6. **Reducing the Problem Space**: If (b geq 2p), then ((2p)! mid b!), and (p^2 mid a^p - b! = p), leading to a contradiction. Thus, (b < 2p). 7. **Bounding (a)**: Using the inequality properties and analyzing factorials: [ a^p = b! + p leq (2p-1)! + p. ] Applying the AM-GM inequality and simplifications, we find: [ begin{aligned} b! + p &leq p + (2p-1)! &< p left(1 + (p+1) (p-1) prod_{k=1}^{p-2} p^2right) &< p cdot p^2 prod_{k=1}^{p-2} p^2 = p^{2p-1} < p^{2p}. end{aligned} ] Hence, (a < p^2). This gives us (a = kp) for some (k < p). 8. **Verifying (a = p)**: Since all prime divisors of (a) are (geq p), (frac{a}{p} < p). If (frac{a}{p} neq 1), it contradicts all prime divisors (geq p), hence (a = p). 9. **Substitute (a = p)**: Consequently: [ begin{aligned} b! &= p^p - p &= p (p^{p-1} - 1). end{aligned} ] We note that (p = 2) gives: [ begin{aligned} 2! &= 2^2 - 2, 2 & = 4 - 2, end{aligned} ] matching ((2,2,2)). For odd primes (p geq 3): [ b! = p^p - p, ] implies more analysis. Using prime factorization properties (p^{p-1} - 1): 10. **Handling Odd Primes (p equiv 1 pmod{4})** (outlined LTE analysis): [ begin{aligned} v_2(b!) & = v_2(p^{p-1} - 1) & = v_2(p^2 - 1) + v_2left(frac{p-1}{2}right) &= v_2((p-1)(p+1)) + v_2(p-1) - 1. end{aligned} ] Simplifying for typical prime conditions results in (p = 3, 5 , 7): 11. **Cases for Small Primes**: [ begin{aligned} b &= 4, (p=3), Right (3,4,3), No solutions & for b!, on frac{p!}, p=5, No valid & b!=Right text{divisibility by 5, p=7}. end{aligned} ] Conclusively, analyzing exponents with LTE confirms no new valid high (p, 11+).

Solving for the number of moles: n ≈ 0.032 mol To find the molar mass of chloroform, we divide the mass of the sample by the number of moles: Molar mass of chloroform = 0.389 g / 0.032 mol Molar mass of chloroform ≈ 12.16 g/mol Therefore, the molar mass of chloroform gas is approximately 12.16 g/mol."},{"prompt":"application for leave","completion":"[Your Name] [Your Designation] [Your Department] [Company/Organization Name] [Company/Organization Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date] Subject: Application for Leave Dear [Supervisor/Manager's Name], I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits.

In \\"a\\" mode (append mode), if the file exists, the new data will be added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. In this mode, the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. In \\"a+\\" mode, similar to \\"a\\" mode, the new data is added at the end of the file if it exists, and a new file is created if it doesn't. However, with \\"a+\\" mode, you can also read the data from the file using \`read()\` or \`readline()\`. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file for writing, but you can move it to a specific position using \`seek()\`. Here is an example of opening a file in append mode: \`\`\`python file = open(\\"example.txt\\", \\"a\\") # Write data at the end of the file file.write(\\"New line\\") file.close() \`\`\` Note that it's important to close the file after writing or reading from it to save the changes and free up system resources."},{"prompt":"a dictionary in python must have what type of keys","completion":"In Python, a dictionary can have keys of any immutable data type. This includes types such as integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

Bag is an example of a container class. It is an unordered collection of items that may have duplicates. In this assignment, you are asked to design and develop an abstract Bag class, called BagInterface, with the following fixed collection of operations: Insert an item of any type into a bag Query the bag contents: two queries Is an item in the bag? How many copies of an item is in the bag? Remove an item from the bag clear the bag Get the size of the bag How many items are there in the bag? Check if the bag is empty Check if the bag is full Assume the bag capacity is 20 In addition to BagInterface, you are asked to implement two classes of bag implementations: PlainBag and MagicChangeBag. PlainBag is a simple container that holds items of any type using an array implementation. MagicChangeBag is also very similar to PlainBag, with two exceptions. When an item is inserted into a magic change bag, it’ll magically disappear, and bag looks empty. Whenever a remove operation is invoked, all the items, except the one is removed will appear.","completion":"Here is an example implementation of the BagInterface, PlainBag, and MagicChangeBag classes: \`\`\`python from typing import Any, List class BagInterface: def __init__(self): self.bag = [] def insert(self, item: Any): self.bag.append(item) def contains(self, item: Any) -> bool: return item in self.bag def count(self, item: Any) -> int: return self.bag.count(item) def remove(self, item: Any): self.bag.remove(item) def clear(self): self.bag = [] def size(self) -> int: return len(self.bag) def is_empty(self) -> bool: return len(self.bag) == 0 def is_full(self) -> bool: return len(self.bag) == 20 class PlainBag(BagInterface): def __init__(self): super().__init__() class MagicChangeBag(BagInterface): def __init__(self): super().__init__() def insert(self, item: Any): pass def remove(self, item: Any): self.bag = [item] \`\`\` In the above implementation, the BagInterface class serves as an abstract class defining the common operations for both PlainBag and MagicChangeBag classes. The PlainBag class uses a simple array implementation to hold the items, while the MagicChangeBag class overrides the insert method to make the item magically disappear and the remove method to make all items except the one to be removed appear. Note that in the MagicChangeBag class, we are assigning the bag to a list containing only the item to be removed when the remove method is called. This makes the bag look empty except for the item to be removed. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"},{"prompt":"use C++.","completion":"Certainly! Here is the C++ implementation of the BagInterface, PlainBag, and MagicChangeBag classes: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <algorithm> #include <vector> using namespace std; template<typename T> class BagInterface { public: virtual void insert(T item) = 0; virtual bool contains(T item) = 0; virtual int count(T item) = 0; virtual void remove(T item) = 0; virtual void clear() = 0; virtual int size() = 0; virtual bool is_empty() = 0; virtual bool is_full() = 0; }; template<typename T> class PlainBag : public BagInterface<T> { private: vector<T> bag; public: void insert(T item) override { bag.push_back(item); } bool contains(T item) override { return find(bag.begin(), bag.end(), item) != bag.end(); } int count(T item) override { return count(bag.begin(), bag.end(), item); } void remove(T item) override { bag.erase(remove(bag.begin(), bag.end(), item), bag.end()); } void clear() override { bag.clear(); } int size() override { return bag.size(); } bool is_empty() override { return bag.empty(); } bool is_full() override { return bag.size() == 20; } }; template<typename T> class MagicChangeBag : public BagInterface<T> { private: vector<T> bag; public: void insert(T item) override { // Item magically disappears, do nothing } bool contains(T item) override { return false; // Bag always appears empty } int count(T item) override { return 0; // Bag always appears empty } void remove(T item) override { bag.clear(); bag.push_back(item); } void clear() override { bag.clear(); } int size() override { return bag.size(); } bool is_empty() override { return bag.empty(); } bool is_full() override { return bag.size() == 20; } }; int main() { PlainBag<int> bag1; bag1.insert(1); bag1.insert(2); bag1.insert(3); cout << \\"PlainBag Contents: \\"; while (!bag1.is_empty()) { int item = bag1.size(); cout << item << \\" \\"; bag1.remove(item); } cout << endl; MagicChangeBag<int> bag2; bag2.insert(1); bag2.insert(2); bag2.insert(3); cout << \\"MagicChangeBag Contents: \\"; while (!bag2.is_empty()) { int item = bag2.size(); cout << item << \\" \\"; bag2.remove(item); } cout << endl; return 0; } \`\`\` In this C++ implementation, the BagInterface is defined as a pure virtual class with abstract methods representing the common operations of the bag. The PlainBag class uses a vector to hold the items, and the MagicChangeBag class overrides the insert and remove methods as required. In the main function, an example usage of both PlainBag and MagicChangeBag is demonstrated. Items are inserted into the bags, and then retrieved and removed from the bags. The contents of the bags are printed to show the expected behavior. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"},{"prompt":"write in 2 files","completion":"Certainly!

The \`<typename T>\` part declares a template parameter named \`T\`, which can be any valid type in C++. When you write \`template<typename T>\` at the beginning of a class or function definition, you are indicating that the code inside the template will be instantiated or generated for different types based on what you specify when you use the template. Here's an example of a specific usage of the template: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> template<typename T> class Container { private: T item; public: Container(T value) : item(value) {} T getItem() { return item; } }; int main() { Container<int> intContainer(42); std::cout << \\"Item in intContainer: \\" << intContainer.getItem() << std::endl; Container<std::string> stringContainer(\\"Hello\\"); std::cout << \\"Item in stringContainer: \\" << stringContainer.getItem() << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, we define a generic class \`Container\` using the \`template<typename T>\` syntax. The class has a private member variable \`item\` of type \`T\`. The constructor takes an argument of type \`T\`, and the \`getItem\` method returns the stored item. In the \`main\` function, we create instances of \`Container\` with different types: \`int\` and \`std::string\`. When we instantiate \`Container<int>\`, the \`T\` in the template is replaced with \`int\`, and when we instantiate \`Container<std::string>\`, the \`T\` is replaced with \`std::string\`. This allows us to use the same class with different types. I hope this clarifies the usage of \`template<typename T>\` in C++.

Vận động vật chất: Đây là hình thức vận động được đề cập trong triết học tự nhiên. Vật chất có khả năng chuyển động từ vị trí này sang vị trí khác, thay đổi hình dạng và trạng thái của nó, dựa trên các quy luật của vật lý. 2. Vận động ý thức: Đây là hình thức vận động được đề cập trong triết học nhận thức. Ý thức thay đổi và phát triển theo thời gian, dựa trên sự tiếp nhận thông tin, suy nghĩ và trích dẫn của con người. 3. Vận động xã hội: Đây là hình thức vận động xã hội được đề cập trong triết học xã hội. Xã hội thay đổi và phát triển qua các quá trình chính trị, kinh tế, văn hóa và xã hội hóa. Sự thay đổi này có thể diễn ra qua các cuộc cách mạng, sự nổi lên và suy thoái của các chế độ xã hội, và các thay đổi trong cách thức hoạt động của các thành phần xã hội khác nhau. 4. Vận động tư duy: Đây là hình thức vận động trong triết học tri thức. Tư duy thay đổi và phát triển thông qua quá trình suy nghĩ, lý luận và trích dẫn. Nó có thể diễn ra qua việc xây dựng các khái niệm, lập luận, và ý tưởng mới hoặc thay đổi các quan điểm và kiến thức hiện có. 5. Vận động tinh thần: Đây là hình thức vận động trong triết học tâm lý và triết học tâm thần. Tâm thần của con người có thể trải qua sự thay đổi và phát triển trong suy tư, trạng thái cảm xúc, và tình trạng tâm trí. Ví dụ, một người có thể trải qua sự gắn kết, sự tập trung cao độ, hoặc sự thay đổi trong tâm trạng và cảm xúc của họ."},{"prompt":"tại sao chỉ có thế giới vật chất chứng minh","completion":"Quan điểm được biết đến như là \\"thế giới vật chất\\" được coi là có điểm chung giữa các hệ thống triết học và khoa học tự nhiên. Đây là quan điểm rằng thực tại tồn tại độc lập và khách quan, tồn tại bên ngoài ý thức của con người và không phụ thuộc vào ý thức đó. Quan điểm này được coi là phù hợp với những phát hiện và lý thuyết trong các lĩnh vực khoa học tự nhiên như vật lý, hóa học và sinh học. Các bằng chứng và chứng minh cho thế giới vật chất có thể dựa trên quan sát và thử nghiệm trong thế giới vật chất. Ví dụ, các nhà khoa học đã tiến hành nhiều thí nghiệm và quan sát để tìm hiểu về tính chất và luật lệ của vật chất trong vũ trụ. Tuy nhiên, cần lưu ý rằng các quan điểm triết học không thể hoàn toàn được chứng minh hoặc bác bỏ một cách tuyệt đối. Thay vào đó, chúng phụ thuộc vào việc xây dựng các lý thuyết, mô hình và bằng chứng để giải thích và mô tả thế giới xung quanh.

Epidermophyton species: Epidermophyton refers to a genus of fungi that commonly infects the skin, hair, and nails. It is known to cause conditions such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), ringworm (tinea corporis), and jock itch (tinea cruris). Epidermophyton infections are typically characterized by itchy, red, scaly patches on the skin. 2. Microsporum species: Microsporum is another genus of fungi that can cause skin infections in humans. It is responsible for conditions like ringworm, especially on the scalp (tinea capitis), as well as infections of the body (tinea corporis) and nails (tinea unguium). Microsporum infections result in itchy, circular rashes with raised edges and clear centers. 3. Trichophyton species: Trichophyton is a diverse genus of fungi that includes several species that commonly cause skin infections in humans. Some of the most common Trichophyton species include Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton tonsurans. They are associated with conditions like athlete's foot, ringworm, nail infections, and scalp infections. Symptoms can include itching, redness, scaly patches, hair loss, and thickened or discolored nails.

Primary bacteria are the initial bacteria that cause an infection. They are usually the main culprits and primary cause of a disease. For example, if you get a cut on your skin, primary bacteria may enter the wound and cause an infection. Secondary bacteria, on the other hand, are additional bacteria that can join the infection after it has already started. They often take advantage of the weakened immune system or damaged tissues caused by the primary bacteria. Secondary bacteria can worsen the infection or make it more difficult to treat. In some cases, the secondary bacteria can even become the main cause of the disease. To summarize, primary bacteria are the first bacteria to cause an infection, while secondary bacteria are additional bacteria that can join the infection and make it worse. Both types of bacteria can cause harm to our bodies and lead to various illnesses."},{"prompt":"Explain in simple terms primary and secondary bacteria infection","completion":"In simple terms, a primary bacterial infection occurs when harmful bacteria invade the body and cause an infection. This is usually the first infection to occur and is caused by bacteria that are inherently harmful or have entered the body from outside sources, such as through a wound or contaminated food. A secondary bacterial infection, on the other hand, happens when additional bacteria join an existing infection. The primary infection could be caused by bacteria or by other factors like a virus or fungus. Secondary bacterial infections can happen when the immune system is weakened or damaged due to the primary infection. These secondary bacteria take advantage of the body's weakened defenses and establish a new infection in addition to the existing one, which can make the illness worse and more difficult to treat. To simplify, primary bacterial infections are the first infections caused by harmful bacteria, and secondary bacterial infections occur when additional bacteria join an existing infection, often when the immune system is weakened. Both types of infections require appropriate treatment to help the body fight off the harmful bacteria and restore health."},{"prompt":"Bjr, désolée votre modele de perroquet est incomprehensible meme en le traduisant ,dommage que les explications ne soient pas plus claires avec le traducteur , du coup je l'ai abandonné .

Достоевского \\"Преступление и наказание\\". В этом произведении обращается внимание на силу духа главного героя, который, несмотря на внутренние сомнения и моральные противоречия, все-таки преодолевает свои трудности, идет весьма сложным путем исправления и находит душевное и нравственное исцеление. Из жизни: Как пример из реальной жизни можно привести историю американского физика Стивена Хокинга. Стоя перед диагнозом редкого нейромоторного заболевания, который лишил его возможности передвигаться или говорить, Хокинг не сдался и продолжил развиваться в своей научной карьере, внедрив новую систему коммуникации с помощью компьютера и сделав знаменитый вклад в космологию теорию черных дыр. Его сила духа и детерминированность позволили ему преодолеть множество трудностей и стать одним из самых известных и уважаемых ученых в мире."},{"prompt":"расскажи конуртенее про героя в первом примере","completion":"Главный герой романа \\"Преступление и наказание\\" Федора Михайловича Достоевского – Родион Раскольников – является примером человека с сильным духом. Он – студент, который погружен в свои мысли о том, что разделение людей на \\"высшие\\" и \\"низшие\\" классы даёт право \\"высшим\\" на совершение преступлений, чтобы достичь своих целей. Раскольников решает убить старую залоговую бабку и украсть ее деньги, чтобы финансово поддержать свою семью и достичь высоких духовных высот. Однако после совершения ужасного преступления, Раскольников ощущает мучительные угрызения совести и погружается в внутренний конфликт. Несмотря на внутренние мучения и сомнения, он остается человеком с сильным духом – именно благодаря этому он начинает свой путь исправления. Раскольников приходит к пониманию, что его закономерности и стремление к высоким идеалам не оправдывает преступление. Сила духа Раскольникова проявляется в его способности совладать с муками совести, в его постоянном стремлении исправить содеянное, а также в его способности преодолевать трудности на пути к истине и моральному восстановлению. Через тернии и испытания Раскольников осознает свою ошибку и находит путь к истинной покаянию и смирению. Таким образом, герой первого примера – Раскольников – является ярким образцом человека с сильным духом, который способен преодолевать моральные и психологические трудности и находить истину и благородство души."},{"prompt":"приведи другой пример из жизни, он должен соответствовать простому бытовому жизненному опыту","completion":"Другой пример из жизни, соответствующий простому бытовому жизненному опыту, может быть история обычного человека, который сталкивается с трудностями в работе или учебе, но благодаря своей силе духа и настойчивости преодолевает их и достигает поставленных целей. Например, представим ситуацию, когда студент столкнулся с серией неудачных экзаменов. Его оценки падают, и он чувствует, что не справляется с учебной нагрузкой. Возникают сомнения и отчаяние, но вместо того, чтобы сдаться, он решает собрать волю в кулак и изменить свой подход. Этот студент начинает активно разрабатывать новые стратегии учебы и работать над улучшением своих знаний. Он установил четкие цели, разбил учебный материал на более маленькие и управляемые части, создал расписание и приложил дополнительные усилия для подготовки к экзаменам. Он также обратился за помощью к преподавателям и учебным ресурсам, чтобы улучшить свое понимание предмета. С такими усилиями и настойчивостью, студент постепенно начинает видеть положительные изменения. Его оценки начинают улучшаться, а самооценка и уверенность в своих способностях возрастают. В конечном итоге, благодаря его силе духа и настойчивости, студент успешно справляется с экзаменами и достигает поставленной учебной цели. Этот пример демонстрирует, что благодаря силе духа и настойчивости в преодолении трудностей, даже в простом бытовом опыте, мы можем достичь поставленных целей и преуспеть в разных сферах жизни."},{"prompt":"Hi, can you please review this email? it should sound friendly yet professional: Hope you had a great Thanksgiving weekend.
