John saves 10% of his salary, which amounts to ( 0.10S ), and he invests 5% into a retirement fund, which is ( 0.05S ).

Allen gave the delivery man 100 and received 60 in change, so the amount he paid (including the tip) is: 100 - 60 = 40 Since the total cost of the pizza is 35, the tip is the difference between what Allen paid and the cost of the pizza: 40 (amount paid) - 35 (cost of pizza) = 5 (tip) Now, we can find the ratio of the tip to the total cost of the order: Tip : Total Cost = 5 : 35 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 5: (5 / 5) : (35 / 5) = 1 : 7 So, the ratio of the tip to the total cost of the order is boxed{1:7} ."},{"prompt":"Two circles with radii ( r ) and ( R ) touch each other internally.

We need to show that there exists a number c > 0 (depending only on alpha), such that for any integers p and natural numbers q, [ left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| > frac{c}{q^n} ] Steps of the Solution: 1. Consider two cases: - |alpha - frac{p}{q}| geq 1 - |alpha - frac{p}{q}| < 1 2. In the first case, if |alpha - frac{p}{q}| geq 1, the desired inequality is trivially satisfied with c = 1. 3. Thus, we will focus on the second case where |alpha - frac{p}{q}| < 1. Since |alpha - frac{p}{q}| < 1, it implies left|frac{p}{q}right| < |alpha| + 1. 4. Express the polynomial f(x) in its factored form: [ f(x) = a_n prod_{i=1}^n (x - alpha_i) ] where alpha = alpha_1. Then, [ left| f left( frac{p}{q} right) right| = left| a_n right| left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| prod_{i=2}^n left| frac{p}{q} - alpha_i right| ] 5. Using the inequality |frac{p}{q} - alpha_i| leq |frac{p}{q}| + |alpha_i| < |alpha| + 1 + |alpha_i| for i = 2, ldots, n, we have: [ left| f left( frac{p}{q} right) right| < left| a_n right| left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| prod_{i=2}^n (|alpha| + 1 + |alpha_i|) = c_1 left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| ] where c_1 is a positive number depending on |a_n| and alpha. 6. Assume a_0, ldots, a_n are integers that are mutually prime in their entirety. Therefore, the number |a_n| is fully determined by alpha. Next, observe that the expression q^n f(p/q) yields: [ q^n f left( frac{p}{q} right) = a_n p^n + a_{n-1} p^{n-1} q + ldots + a_0 q^n ] which is an integer.

Let y = 2z, then the equation becomes: [ 2x^6 - (2z)^2 = 2 ] [ 2x^6 - 4z^2 = 2 ] [ x^6 - 2z^2 = 1. ] Factorizing, we get: [ (x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1) = 2z^2. ] As x is an integer and x geq 3, and x is odd: [ text{gcd}(x^3 - 1, x^3 + 1) = text{gcd}(x^3 - 1, x^3 + 1 - (x^3 - 1)) = text{gcd}(x^3 - 1, 2) ] Note x^3 - 1 and x^3 + 1 have a gcd of 2 because: [ (x^3 - 1) text{ and } (x^3 + 1) = 2 text{ are coprime to 3.} ] Thus, we set: [ x^3 - 1 = 2a, quad x^3 + 1 = 2b ] so: [ 2b - 2a = 2 ] [ b - a = 1. ] 4. **Further inspection using polynomial properties:** Let x^3 - 1 = at^2, where a = 1 or a = 2. Now consider: [ x^3 - 1 = at^2.] If a=1, considering the factors of a prime state: [ x^2 + x + 1 = t^2. ] Since: [ x^2 < x^2 + x + 1 < (x+1)^2 ] this is inconsistent as x^2 + x + 1 cannot form a perfect square between consecutive squares.

The vertex of the parabola is at ( (0, 4) ). 2. For a parabola ( y = ax^2 ), the focus is located at ( (0, frac{1}{4a}) ). Here ( a = -2 ), so the focus is at ( (0, frac{1}{-8}) = (0, -frac{1}{8}) ). 3. Since the vertex is shifted up by 4 units (from ( y = -2x^2 ) to ( y = -2x^2 + 4 )), we need to add this shift to the y-coordinate of the focus calculated from the standard parabola. Therefore, the new y-coordinate of the focus is ( -frac{1}{8} + 4 = frac{32}{8} - frac{1}{8} = frac{31}{8} ).

Part (a): Integer Weights 1. Arrange weights in increasing order denoted as ( p_0 leq p_1 leq ldots leq p_{19} ). 2. For the minimal weight required to weigh 1 gram, ( p_0 leq 1 ) (otherwise, we cannot measure weight 1g). 3. For weights to measure 2 grams, we need ( p_1 leq 2 ) (since 2 grams cannot be achieved with ( {p_0} )). 4. To measure 4 grams, we require ( p_2 leq 2^2 = 4 ). 5. Proceeding iteratively, each additional weight should be the double of the previous, since with ( p_0, p_1, p_2 ldots, p_k ) we can weigh all combinations from 1 to ( 2^k - 1 ). 6. Extending this reasoning for all 20 weights, we obtain ( p_0 leq 1, p_1 leq 2, dots, p_7 leq 128 = 2^7 ). 7. Summing these smallest values: ( 1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 128 = 255 ). 8. Hence, the combined weight of the lightest 8 weights is 255 grams. 9. The combined weight of the remaining 12 weights must be at least ( 1997 - 255 = 1742 ) grams. 10. Therefore, the average weight of these remaining 12 weights must be at least ( frac{1742}{12} approx 145.17 ). 11. Since weights are integers, the heaviest weight must be at least ( 146 ) grams to ensure the total requirements are met.

Therefore, the number of employees who will receive rewards is boxed{12}. Part 3: Explanation to Employee A From the analysis in Part 1, we found that the median sales amount is 7.7 ten thousand yuan. This means that half of the employees, or 10 out of 20, have sales amounts exceeding 7.7 ten thousand yuan. The company decided to reward these top 10 employees. Since Employee A's sales amount is 7.5 ten thousand yuan, which is below the median of 7.7 ten thousand yuan, Employee A falls outside the top half of the sales amounts. Therefore, Employee A does not qualify for the reward based on the company's criteria of rewarding the top half of the performers.

The goal is to determine for which ( n ) it is possible to end the game with only one piece remaining.

Color the chessboard in a repeating pattern of three colors, say A, B, and C, such that each ( 3 times 3 ) block contains exactly one of each color in each row and column. 3. **Counting Pieces**: If ( n ) is divisible by 3, then the number of pieces on each color (A, B, and C) is equal. Let the number of pieces on each color be ( 3k ). 4. **Move Analysis**: Each move removes two pieces of different colors and adds one piece of the third color.

This means that ( xW ) grams of the original solution was removed and replaced with ( xW ) grams of the second solution, which is 74% sugar by weight. Therefore, the amount of sugar added from the second solution is ( 0.74xW ) grams. The total weight of the new solution is still ( W ) grams because we are replacing part of the original solution with the same weight of the second solution. The new solution is 35% sugar by weight, so the total amount of sugar in the new solution is ( 0.35W ) grams.

The area S of triangle ABC can be expressed using the height from B to side AC, which we will denote as h. Therefore, S = frac{1}{2} times AC times h = frac{1}{2}b h. To find h, we use right triangle ABD. By the Pythagorean theorem, h^2 + left(frac{b}{2}right)^2 = 1^2, h^2 = 1 - frac{b^2}{4}. Now, we can express the area in terms of b: S = frac{1}{2}b h = frac{1}{2}b sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{4}} = frac{1}{2}b sqrt{frac{4 - b^2}{4}}. To maximize S, we need to maximize b sqrt{4 - b^2}.

This implies there must be at least one acute angle (angle less than ( 90^{circ} )) and at least one obtuse angle (angle greater than ( 90^{circ} )). 4. **Tangents of Angles:** - The tangent of an acute angle is positive. - The tangent of an obtuse angle is negative. 5. **Analysis of the Tangent Values:** If ( m ) is the tangent of one of the angles, this ( m ) can either be positive or negative: - If ( tan(theta_1) = m ), depending on the nature of ( m ) (positive for acute, negative for obtuse), we should check the implications for other angles. - If ( tan(theta_1) = m ) and (theta_1) is acute, then similarly other angles (theta_2, theta_3, theta_4) with the same tangent should logically follow the same positive or negative sign, but: - If ( tan(theta_2) = m ), (theta_2 ) also being acute. - Therefore, having only acute angles would not sum to 360 degrees, indicating the sum has missed an obtuse angle's presence. 6. **Conclusion Regarding Different Signs:** Considering one must be obtuse and one acute, the tangent of each would have different signs. This inference denies the possibility of having the same tangent ( m ) for all angles in a convex quadrilateral linked to different sign value tangents (e.g., ( +m, -m ) for acute, obtuse). # Conclusion: Thus, in a convex quadrilateral, it is impossible for the tangents of all four angles to be the same given the requirement of positive and negative tangent values due to varying angle sizes.

However, a more general form that does not depend on specific side lengths is: [ OG = sqrt{R^2 - frac{2}{9}(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)} ] 2. **Using the Relationship Between (R), (r), and the Sides of the Triangle**: We know that: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) ] where (s) is the semiperimeter of the triangle. Substituting this into the expression for (OG), we get: [ OG = sqrt{R^2 - frac{2}{9} cdot 2(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr)} ] Simplifying further: [ OG = sqrt{R^2 - frac{4}{9}(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr)} ] 3. **Simplifying the Expression**: To simplify the inequality (OG leq sqrt{R(R - 2r)}), we need to show that: [ R^2 - frac{4}{9}(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) leq R(R - 2r) ] This simplifies to: [ R^2 - frac{4}{9}(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) leq R^2 - 2Rr ] Rearranging terms, we get: [ frac{4}{9}(s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr) geq 2Rr ] Multiplying both sides by (frac{9}{4}), we obtain: [ s^2 - r^2 - 4Rr geq frac{9}{2}Rr ] Simplifying further: [ s^2 geq r^2 + 4Rr + frac{9}{2}Rr ] [ s^2 geq r^2 + frac{17}{2}Rr ] 4. **Using Known Inequalities**: We know that: [ s^2 geq 4Rr + r^2 ] This is a well-known inequality in triangle geometry.

Furthermore, the third vertex of each triangle coincides with a vertex of the other hexagon that doesn't share an edge with the same triangle. 2. **Unique solid determination:** This configuration uniquely determines the solid, which can be visualized as outlined in the referenced figure. 3. **Equal distances between corresponding vertices:** Due to the regularity of the triangles, we establish that each vertex of one hexagon is at a unit distance from two vertices of the other hexagon. This implies that each vertex of one hexagon lies in the perpendicular bisecting plane of an edge of the other hexagon. 4. **Intersecting perpendicular bisectors:** These bisecting planes intersect along the line connecting the centers of the two hexagons. As this line is perpendicular to the hexagons' planes, its midpoint, which is also the center of the circumscribing sphere, is equidistant from all the vertices of the solid. 5. **Identifying and labeling important points:** Let the centers of the hexagons be (T) and (S). Let (O) be the midpoint of (TS), which is the center of the sphere. Let vertices (A) and (B) be adjacent vertices of the hexagon centered at (T), and let (G) be the third vertex of the triangle (triangle ABG) sharing edge (AB). 6. **Calculating specific distances:** The distance (TF = GF = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) because (T) and (F) are vertices of an equilateral triangle. Let ( M ) be the orthogonal projection of ( G ) onto the plane ( ABT ). 7. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:** Since ( GF ) and ( TF ) are both (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), while ( FM = TM - TF = 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}). 8. **Right triangle in 3D space:** The triangle (GMF) is a right triangle because (GM) is perpendicular to the plane containing ( FABT ). Thus, [ GM = sqrt{GF^2 - FM^2} = sqrt{left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 - left( 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 } = sqrt{frac{3}{4} - left(1 - sqrt{3} + frac{3}{4} right)} = sqrt{ frac{3}{4} - (1 - sqrt{3} + frac{3}{4}) } ] Simplifying the expression inside the square root, [ GM = sqrt{frac{3}{4} - 1 + sqrt{3} - frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{sqrt{3} - 1} ] 9. **Calculating the distance (OT):** Since (S) and (T) are centers of the hexagons, the distance (ST = GM).

This assumption simplifies the analysis because the inequality is symmetric in (a, b, c). 2. **Case Analysis**: We will consider the cases based on the signs of (a, b, c). However, since the inequality is symmetric, we can assume (a, b, c) are positive without loss of generality.

Since a, b, and c are the sides of a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality: - a + c > b implies that a - b + c > 0. - Similarly, the reverse inequality a < b + c implies that a - b - c < 0.

We need to prove whether the polygons are congruent. # Proof by induction on n: 1. **Base Case: n=3** - For n=3, we have triangles A_1A_2A_3 and B_1B_2B_3 with corresponding sides equal: A_1A_2 = B_1B_2, A_2A_3 = B_2B_3, and A_3A_1 = B_3B_1. - By the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence criterion for triangles, triangle A_1A_2A_3 cong triangle B_1B_2B_3. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume that the statement holds for any convex polygon with k geq 3 sides. That is, if two k-gons have all corresponding sides equal and k-3 corresponding angles equal, the polygons are congruent. 3. **Induction Step: n = k + 1** - We need to show that if two convex (k+1)-gons A_{1}A_{2}...A_{k+1} and B_{1}B_{2}...B_{k+1} have corresponding sides equal and k-2 corresponding angles equal, then the polygons are congruent. - By hypothesis, the polygons have a pair of equal corresponding angles. - Remove a triangle from each polygon such that the removed triangles have two sides enclosing the given equal angles. Let's consider removing triangle A_1A_2A_{k+1} and triangle B_1B_2B_{k+1}. This leaves us with k-gons A_{2}...A_{k}A_{k+1} and B_{2}...B_{k}B_{k+1}. - Since A_1A_2 = B_1B_2, A_2A_3 = B_2B_3, ..., A_kA_{k+1} = B_kB_{k+1} and n-3 = (k+1)-3 = (k-2) angles are equal in the original polygons, we rely on the induction hypothesis. - Thus, these k-gons are congruent: A_{2}...A_{k}A_{k+1} cong B_{2}...B_{k}B_{k+1}. 4. **Conclusion:** - Since the triangles and the resulting k-gons are congruent, the original (k+1)-gons are congruent. Given this detailed inductive proof, we can conclude that the convex polygons A_{1}A_{2}...A_{n} and B_{1}B_{2}...B_{n} are congruent provided that their corresponding sides are equal and n-3 of their corresponding angles are equal. blacksquare # Problem 2: It is given that four points A, B, C, and D lie on a plane in such a way that no three points are collinear. We need to show that not all triangles ABC, BCD, CDA, and DAB can be acute-angled. # Proof: 1. **Case 1: Points form a convex quadrilateral.** - Suppose A, B, C, and D form a convex quadrilateral. - The sum of the internal angles of a quadrilateral is 360^circ. - For all triangles to be acute-angled, all angles of the quadrilateral must be less than 90^circ, making their total < 360^circ, which is a contradiction. 2. **Case 2: One point inside the triangle formed by the other three points.** - Assume point D lies inside triangle ABC. - We need to sum angles around point D, which would add up to 360^circ. - Suppose angle ADB, angle BDC, angle CDA, and angle DAB are all less than 90^circ. Summing these angles angle ADB + angle BDC + angle CDA + angle DAB = 360^circ, at least one of these must be > 90^circ, showing at least one triangle is not acute. # Conclusion: Thus, given any four points on a plane, it is not possible for all triangles ABC, BCD, CDA, and DAB to be acute-angled. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Consider the polynomial 49x^3 105x^2 + 63x 10 = 0 whose roots are in arithmetic progression.

What is the divisor?","completion":"To find the divisor, we first need to calculate the number that is exactly divisible after adding 69.00000000008731 to 8679921. So, the new number is: 8679921 + 69.00000000008731 = 8679990.00000000008731 Since we are looking for a whole number that is exactly divisible, we can ignore the decimal part as it is very close to zero and does not affect the divisibility of whole numbers. Therefore, the new number is essentially 8679990. Now, we need to find the divisor that exactly divides 8679990. Since the number to be added is 69 to make it exactly divisible, it implies that 8679990 is a multiple of 69. To confirm this, we divide 8679990 by 69: 8679990 ÷ 69 = 125797.10144927536 Since the result is not a whole number, it seems there might be a mistake in the initial assumption or the provided information.

If we correct the number to be added to 72, then the new number would be: 8679921 + 72 = 8679993 Now, 8679993 is exactly divisible by 69: 8679993 ÷ 69 = 125797 Therefore, the divisor is boxed{69,} and the number to be added should be 72 instead of 69.00000000008731 to get a number exactly divisible by 69."},{"prompt":"Given a and b are positive real numbers.

Recall that for non-negative numbers (x) and (y), the AM-GM inequality states: [ frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy} implies x + y geq 2sqrt{xy}. ] 4. **Bounding Each Term:** Consider each term separately: [ ab(a-b) leq frac{a^3}{3} quad text{and} quad bc(b-c) leq frac{b^3}{3} quad text{and} quad cd(c-d) leq frac{c^3}{3} quad text{and} quad da(d-a) leq frac{d^3}{3}. ] This is because (a, b, c, d in [0, 1]) and the maximum value of (x(x-y)) for (x, y in [0, 1]) is (frac{x^3}{3}). 5. **Summing the Terms:** Summing these inequalities, we get: [ ab(a-b) + bc(b-c) + cd(c-d) + da(d-a) leq frac{a^3}{3} + frac{b^3}{3} + frac{c^3}{3} + frac{d^3}{3}. ] 6. **Maximizing the Sum:** To find the maximum value of (frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3}{3}), we note that the maximum value of (a^3, b^3, c^3, d^3) is 1 (since (a, b, c, d leq 1)). Therefore: [ frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3}{3} leq frac{4}{3}. ] 7. **Refining the Bound:** However, this bound is too loose. We need to use a more refined approach.

We construct ( H_{1k} ) for each ( k ) (these are subgraphs consisting of vertices colored 1 and ( k ) and edges between them). 8. **Odd cycle-free subgraphs**: Because the vertices of ( H ) are already colored without forming odd cycles, ( H_{1k} ) must also be odd cycle-free. Thus, ( G_{1k} ) (constructed by adding ( A ) and its edges back to ( H_{1k} )) remains cycle-free if there are no new odd cycles formed through ( A ). 9. **Contradiction if all attempts fail**: If through each ( k ) there remains at least one odd cycle involving ( A ), ( A ) is directly involved in forming more than ( N ) odd cycles, which contradicts the problem assumption since no vertex lies on more than ( N ) odd cycles. 10. **Conclusion with proper coloring**: Because the contradiction cannot exist, there must be at least one valid coloring for ( A ) using the ( N + 2 ) colors such that coloring rules in ( G ) are preserved, completing the induction.

Let's call line OC \\"h\\" (hypotenuse of the right triangle OCD), OD \\"a\\" (adjacent side to angle θ in triangle OCD), and CD \\"o\\" (opposite side to angle θ in our triangle). Now, since the triangle OCD is an isosceles right triangle, we have: o = a In any right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Thus, for our right triangle OCD, with respect to angle θ, which is the same as ∠CDO or ∠CDO (45°), we have: sin theta = frac{o}{h} = frac{a}{h} Given that OC makes an angle of 60° with the plane AO and BO, by trigonometric ratio in a 30°-60°-90° triangle, we can deduce that if OD = a (which is the shorter leg of the 30°-60°-90° triangle formed by OA, OC, and OD), then OC = 2a (the length of the hypotenuse of this 30°-60°-90° triangle). h = 2a Substituting h in the earlier equation, we get: sin theta = frac{a}{2a} = frac{1}{2} Therefore, the sine of the angle formed by line OC and plane AOB is boxed{frac{1}{2}}."},{"prompt":"A certain number has a 150 : X ratio to the number 2, and the certain number is 300.

Let these points be A_2, A_3, A_4. This means the segments A_1A_2, A_1A_3, and A_1A_4 are all red. 3. **Checking for a Monochromatic Triangle:** - We now consider the segments between A_2, A_3, and A_4. - There are three segments between these points: A_2A_3, A_2A_4, and A_3A_4. - If any one of these segments is red, suppose A_2A_3 is red, then the triangle A_1A_2A_3 is entirely red and hence monochromatic. - If none of the segments A_2A_3, A_2A_4, and A_3A_4 are red, they must all be blue. This forms a blue triangle A_2A_3A_4. 4. **Conclusion:** In either scenario, we have found a monochromatic triangle: - If any of the segments A_2A_3, A_2A_4, or A_3A_4 is red, we have a red triangle involving A_1. - If all segments A_2A_3, A_2A_4, A_3A_4 are blue, we have a blue triangle.

Both D and E lie on the circumcircle omega of triangle AB_1C_1. 3. **Apply Brokard's Theorem**: According to Brokard's Theorem, the polar of the intersection of diagonals DE with respect to omega is the line BC. This implies that the tangents to omega at B_1 and C_1 intersect on the line BC. 4. **Assume omega passes through A_{HM}**: Suppose omega passes through A_{HM} and the tangents to omega at B_1 intersect BC at Y.

Therefore, the tangents to omega at B_1 and C_1 meet on BC. 6. **Contradiction if omega does not pass through A_{HM}**: Suppose omega does not pass through A_{HM}. Consider a homothety centered at A mapping omega cap AA_{HM} to A_{HM}. Let the tangents to omega at B_1 and C_1 meet at Y on BC. Let B' and C' be the images of B_1 and C_1 under the homothety.

Since A_{HM} in odot(AB'C'), Y' lies on BC. 7. **Homothety properties**: From the homothety, we have B_1Y parallel B'Y' and C_1Y parallel C'Y', so the homothety maps Y to Y'. Since both Y and Y' lie on BC, it follows that omega cap AA_{HM} = A_{HM}, so omega passes through A_{HM}.

Again using the z-score transformation: P(0 < X < 2a) = Pleft(frac{0 - a}{d} < Z < frac{2a - a}{d}right) = Pleft(-frac{a}{d} < Z < frac{a}{d}right) Notice that this is the sum of the probabilities of Z being between -frac{a}{d} and 0, and between 0 and frac{a}{d}: Pleft(-frac{a}{d} < Z < frac{a}{d}right) = Pleft(-frac{a}{d} < Z < 0right) + Pleft(0 < Z < frac{a}{d}right) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6 So the probability of x taking a value within the interval (0, 2a) is boxed{0.6}, which corresponds to option B."},{"prompt":"Three identical point charges are positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, storing 15 Joules of energy in total.

The total number of lines (sides or diagonals) formed by joining any two vertices is binom{9}{2} = 36. 3. A pair of lines will intersect inside the nonagon only if the endpoints of the lines form a convex quadrilateral. This occurs if no two lines are adjacent sides and neither line is a side of the polygon. Given this, we need to select 4 different vertices from the 9 available. 4. Number of ways to select any 4 vertices from 9 is binom{9}{4} = 126. However, this counts all four-point selections, including those where lines might not intersect within the polygon due to adjacencies. 5. We need to subtract the cases where the quadrilateral is not convex or formed by adjacent sides: - There are 9 sets of 4 vertices that include two pairs of adjacent vertices (since nonagon is cyclic, any choice like 1234, 2345, ..., 7891 falls in this category). - Each of these non-intersecting sets prevents the adequate count of quadrilaterals where diagonals would intersect inside. 6.

Observe that both (x^{3}) and (y^{3}) must be powers of 2 because their sum is a power of 2. If either (x) or (y) is odd, the cube of an odd number will be odd, and their sum would not be even, contradicting the fact that (2^{30}) is even. Therefore, both (x) and (y) must be even. 2. **Step 2: Factorize (x^{3} + y^{3} = 2^{30})** Use the factorization formula for sums of cubes: [ x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}) ] For this to be a power of 2, both (x+y) and (x^{2}-xy+y^{2}) must be powers of 2 because the only factors of a power of 2 are other powers of 2. 3. **Step 3: Consider the implications of the factorization:** Suppose: [ x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}) = 2^{n}, quad n geq 2 ] If (x + y = 2^a) and (x^{2} - xy + y^{2} = 2^b), then (a + b = 30). 4. **Step 4: Solve (x^2 - xy + y^2 = 2^b):** Consider (x^2 - xy + y^2): - To have (x^{2} - xy + y^{2} = 2^b) be a power of 2, with (x) and (y) being even, imply that (2^b) must be minimal, i.e., ( b = 0 ) or ( b = 1 ). 5. **Step 5: Reduce the problem with even (x) and (y):** Since (x) and (y) are both even, let (x = 2^k u) and (y = 2^k v) where (u) and (v) are integers.

Hence, the commutative law holds for the operation \\"otimes\\". **Associative Law:** We need to check if (aotimes b)otimes c = aotimes (botimes c) for all real numbers a, b, and c. - First, calculate (aotimes b)otimes c = (ab + a + b)otimes c = (ab + a + b)c + (ab + a + b) + c = abc + ac + bc + ab + a + b + c. - Next, calculate aotimes (botimes c) = aotimes (bc + b + c) = a(bc + b + c) + a + (bc + b + c) = abc + ab + ac + a + bc + b + c. - Comparing the two expressions, we see that (aotimes b)otimes c neq aotimes (botimes c), indicating that the associative law does not hold. **Distributive Law:** We need to check if (a+b)otimes c = aotimes c + botimes c for all real numbers a, b, and c. - First, calculate (a+b)otimes c = (a+b)c + (a+b) + c = ac + bc + a + b + c. - Next, calculate aotimes c + botimes c = (ac + a + c) + (bc + b + c) = ac + a + c + bc + b + c. - Rearranging the terms, we get ac + bc + a + b + 2c. - Since ac + bc + a + b + c neq ac + bc + a + b + 2c, the distributive law does not hold for the operation \\"otimes\\".

The standard form of a parabola with its vertex at the origin is x^{2}=4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Comparing this with the given parabola, we have 4p=8, which means p=2. Therefore, the focus of the parabola, denoted as point F, is at (0,p)=(0,2). 2. **Determine the Left Vertex of the Hyperbola**: The hyperbola is given by frac{{x}^{2}}{8}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b}=1. The standard form of a horizontal hyperbola is frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, where 2a is the distance between the vertices.

Substituting a=2sqrt{2} into this formula, we get the equation of the asymptotes as y=pm frac{sqrt{b}}{2sqrt{2}}x. 4. **Parallel Condition**: Since the line AF is parallel to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola, the slope of line AF must equal the slope of the asymptote. The slope of line AF can be calculated using the coordinates of A and F: frac{2-0}{0-(-2sqrt{2})}=frac{2}{2sqrt{2}}=frac{1}{sqrt{2}}.

This is because: - If you buy an odd number of cans, there is 1 empty can left. - If you buy an even number of cans, there are 2 empty cans left. - This means the actual number of cans of cola consumed is 0.5 or 1 less than 1.5 times the number of cans purchased. - Therefore, the formula f(n) = n + left[frac{n-1}{2}right] correctly represents the maximum number of cans of cola that can actually be consumed, where n is the number of cans bought and left[xright] represents the largest integer not greater than x. - This confirms that statement ③ is also correct. **Conclusion:** - The incorrect statement is ①, while statements ② and ③ are correct.

By substituting ( y = 10 - x ), it implies: [ f(10 + (10 - y)) = f(10 - (10 - y)) implies f(20 - y) = f(y) ] This can be rewritten as: [ f(20 - x) = f(x) ] 3. **Combining the Equations:** From the second given functional equation, we have: [ f(20 - x) = -f(20 + x) ] Using the previously derived relation ( f(20 - x) = f(x) ), we can replace ( f(20 - x) ) in the second equation: [ f(x) = -f(20 + x) ] 4. **Periodicity:** Let's derive if there is a periodic property.

The discriminant (Delta) of this equation is given by: [ Delta = a^2 - 4b ] According to the problem, (Delta) is the square of a rational number. Therefore, we can write: [ Delta = left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 ] where (p) and (q) are integers, and (q neq 0). 2. Since (Delta = a^2 - 4b) is an integer (because (a) and (b) are integers), it follows that: [ a^2 - 4b = frac{p^2}{q^2} ] For (frac{p^2}{q^2}) to be an integer, (q^2) must divide (p^2). This implies: [ q^2 mid p^2 ] 3. To show that (q mid p), consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of (p) and (q). Let: [ gcd(p, q) = d ] Then we can write: [ p = dx quad text{and} quad q = dy ] where (x) and (y) are integers such that (gcd(x, y) = 1). 4. Substituting (p = dx) and (q = dy) into (frac{p^2}{q^2}), we get: [ frac{p^2}{q^2} = frac{(dx)^2}{(dy)^2} = frac{d^2 x^2}{d^2 y^2} = frac{x^2}{y^2} ] Since (frac{p^2}{q^2}) is an integer, (frac{x^2}{y^2}) must also be an integer. Given that (gcd(x, y) = 1), the only way (frac{x^2}{y^2}) can be an integer is if (y = 1). Therefore: [ frac{x^2}{1^2} = x^2 ] is an integer. 5. Since (y = 1), it follows that (q = d) and (p = dx). This means (q) divides (p), i.e., (q mid p). 6. Since (q mid p), (frac{p}{q}) is an integer. Therefore, (left(frac{p}{q}right)^2) is a perfect square of an integer, and hence (Delta) is a perfect square of an integer. 7.

The total salary of the technicians is 6 * Rs. 12000 = Rs. 72000. The total salary of the supervisors is S * Rs. 15000. The total salary of the laborers is L * Rs. 6000. According to the problem, the sum of the supervisors' and laborers' salaries is Rs. 270000. So we can write the equation: S * Rs. 15000 + L * Rs. 6000 = Rs. 270000. Now, let's find the total number of workers in the workshop. The total number of workers is the sum of technicians, supervisors, and laborers: Total workers = 6 (technicians) + S (supervisors) + L (laborers). We also know the average salary of all workers is Rs. 9000, and the total salary of all workers is the sum of the salaries of technicians, supervisors, and laborers. Let's denote the total salary of all workers as T. T = 6 * Rs. 12000 + S * Rs. 15000 + L * Rs. 6000. Since the average salary of all workers is Rs. 9000, we can also write: T = (6 + S + L) * Rs. 9000. Now we have two expressions for T, so we can set them equal to each other: 6 * Rs. 12000 + S * Rs. 15000 + L * Rs. 6000 = (6 + S + L) * Rs. 9000. We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of S * Rs. 15000 + L * Rs. 6000 from the first equation (which is Rs. 270000): 6 * Rs. 12000 + Rs. 270000 = (6 + S + L) * Rs. 9000. Now, let's solve for the total number of workers: Rs. 72000 + Rs. 270000 = (6 + S + L) * Rs. 9000, Rs. 342000 = (6 + S + L) * Rs. 9000. Divide both sides by Rs. 9000 to find the total number of workers: (6 + S + L) = Rs. 342000 / Rs. 9000, (6 + S + L) = 38.

Note that triangle M_{1} M_{2} M_{3} is similar to triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} because M_{i} are the midpoints of the sides a_i of triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}. Thus, M_{1} M_{2} parallel A_{1} A_{2}, M_{2} M_{3} parallel A_{2} A_{3}, and M_{3} M_{1} parallel A_{3} A_{1} with frac{M_{1}M_{2}}{A_{1}A_{2}} = frac{1}{2}. 3. Next, we consider triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} and triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}. We know that T_{i} are points where the incircle touches a_{i}, and S_{i} are the reflections of T_{i} over the angle bisectors A_{i}I. 4. In triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}, the angle bisectors A_{i}I intersect the opposite sides at points B_{i}. These bisectors divide angles as follows: angle T_{1} I T_{3} = 180^{circ} - angle A_{2}, angle T_{3} B_{3} A_{3} = angle A_{2} + frac{1}{2} angle A_{3}, angle T_{3} I B_{3} = 90^{circ} - left(angle A_{2} + frac{1}{2} angle A_{3}right), angle T_{3} I S_{3} = 2 angle T_{3} I B_{3} = 180^{circ} - 2 angle A_{2} - angle A_{3}. 5. Thus, angle S_{3} I T_{1} = angle T_{3} I T_{1} - angle T_{3} I S_{3} = angle A_{2} + angle A_{3}. 6. It similarly holds that angle S_{2} I T_{1} = angle A_{2} + angle A_{3}. 7. Therefore, the line segments S_{2}S_{3} are parallel to A_{2}A_{3}. Similarly, we have: S_{3} S_{1} parallel A_{3} A_{1}, quad S_{1} S_{2} parallel A_{1} A_{2}. 8. Combining these equalities, we observe that each corresponding side of triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} and triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} are parallel, thus confirming their similarity. 9. Since triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} and triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} are similar with equal corresponding angles and proportional sides, triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} is also centrally symmetric about point I, the incenter of triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}. 10. Therefore, lines M_{i}S_{i} (where M_{i} is the midpoint and S_{i} is the reflection of T_{i}) must be concurrent.

Using vector methods, consider the following: - Let overrightarrow{AP} = c_0 overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AR} = b_0 overrightarrow{AC}. - Given frac{BQ}{CQ} = frac{PM}{MR} = frac{1}{lambda}, and let frac{LQ}{LP} = mu. 3. The position vector overrightarrow{ML} can be expressed as a combination of the vectors from M to Q and P: overrightarrow{ML} = frac{1}{mu+1}overrightarrow{MQ} + frac{mu}{mu+1}overrightarrow{MP} Substituting the expressions related to P, R, and Q, we get: overrightarrow{ML} = frac{mu}{(mu+1)(lambda+1)}overrightarrow{RP} + frac{1}{mu+1}(overrightarrow{AQ} - overrightarrow{AM}) Expanding, we obtain: overrightarrow{ML} = frac{mu}{(mu+1)(lambda+1)}(overrightarrow{AP} - overrightarrow{AR}) + frac{1}{mu+1}left(frac{1}{lambda+1} overrightarrow{AC} + frac{lambda}{lambda+1} overrightarrow{AB} - frac{1}{lambda+1} overrightarrow{AR} - frac{lambda}{lambda+1} overrightarrow{AP}right) 4. Given that ML parallel AB, it implies overrightarrow{ML} must have no component in the overrightarrow{AC} direction: -frac{mu}{(mu+1)(lambda+1)}overrightarrow{AR} -frac{1}{(mu+1)(lambda+1)} overrightarrow{AR} + frac{1}{(mu+1)(lambda+1)}overrightarrow{AC} = mathbf{0} Simplifying, this leads to: frac{1}{mu+1} = frac{|overrightarrow{AR}|}{|overrightarrow{AC}|} = b_0 Rightarrow frac{mu}{mu+1} = 1 - b_0 Substituting into the formula for overrightarrow{ML}, we get: overrightarrow{ML} = k overrightarrow{AB} 5. Similarly, for overrightarrow{MN}, following analogous steps we find: overrightarrow{MN} = k overrightarrow{AC}left(k = -b_0 c_0 + frac{c_0 + lambda b_0}{lambda + 1}right) 6. To connect L and N: overrightarrow{NL} = overrightarrow{ML} - overrightarrow{MN} = k overrightarrow{AB} - k overrightarrow{AC} = k overrightarrow{CB} Since k is a constant, LN parallel BC follows: therefore LN parallel BC 7.

The total revenue from selling 20 pencils and 40 erasers is 80. The cost of 2 erasers is half the price of a pencil. Let's denote the price of a pencil as P.

We need to prove that the midpoints ( P, Q, ) and ( R ) of the segments ( BC, DE, ) and ( FA ) respectively form an equilateral triangle. 1. We start by setting up the circle with center at the origin and radius ( 1 ). In a complex plane representation, the coordinates of the vertices can be described using exponential functions based on their angular positions. 2. Let the vertices be denoted as: [ A = 1, quad B = A e^{i frac{pi}{3}} = e^{i frac{pi}{3}}, quad C = e^{i frac{2pi}{3}}, quad D=C e^{i frac{pi}{3}}= e^{i pi}, quad E = e^{ifrac{4pi}{3}}, quad F = e^{i frac{5pi}{3}} ] 3.

Setting g'(x) geq 0 for the function to be strictly increasing, we get: 2x^{3} - h geq 0 Rightarrow h leq 2x^{3}. Since this must hold for all x > 0, and considering F(x) = 2x^{3} is increasing for x > 0, the maximum value of h is approached as x approaches 0, which gives h leq 0. Thus, the range of h is: boxed{(-infty, 0]}. Part (2) Given f(x) in M_{1}, and f(a) = f(b) = d with b > a > 0, we analyze the implications.

To prove f(a+b) > 2d, we note: frac{f(a+b)}{a+b} > frac{d}{b} Rightarrow f(a+b) > d frac{a+b}{b}. Since a+b < 2b, we have frac{a+b}{b} < 2, and thus: f(a+b) > d frac{a+b}{b} > 2d.

Therefore, f(x) does not have zero points, implying there exists x_{0} > 0 such that f(x_{0}) < 0.

For 3k to be even, k must be even as well, because the product of an odd number and 3 is always odd. Let's find the smallest and largest even values of k that satisfy the conditions. For the smallest value of k: n = 3k + 4 >= 20 3k >= 16 k >= 16/3 k >= 5.333... Since k must be an even natural number, the smallest even k that satisfies the condition is k = 6.

Here is the detailed solution: 1. **Understanding the Cookie Design:** - The cookie is circular and is divided into sections with semi-circular shapes along its boundary. - There are 64 smaller cells inside the cookie. 2. **Symmetry Analysis:** - The cookie has a center and displays a radial symmetry with axes through the center. - We will leverage this symmetry by initially dividing the cookie into 4 equal parts. - Each of these parts will then be further subdivided. 3. **Initial Division into 4 Parts:** - Draw lines from the center to the circumference to divide the circle into 4 equal sectors. - Since there are 360 degrees in a circle, each sector will encompass an angle of 360^circ / 4 = 90^circ. - These cuts are not necessarily straight lines but can be arcs. However, for simplicity, straight radial lines work effectively in the first division. - This yields four quarter-circle shaped sectors. 4. **Further Division of Each Quarter:** - Each of these quarter sectors will now be further divided into 4 equal parts, achieving the total of 4 times 4 = 16 smaller parts. - Since each quarter sector covers 90 degrees, we need to divide this into smaller angles of 90^circ / 4 = 22.5^circ each. - Again, drawing radial lines from the center to the boundary will suffice. 5. **Final Shape Confirmation:** - Ensuring that each of the 16 resulting parts is symmetrical and equal in area is key. - Each will include 4 smaller cells and will be congruent due to the radial and circular nature of the cuts. 6. **Verification with an Alternate Approach:** - Another approach could involve curved lines or arcs that ensure uniformity, ensuring each part matches both in area and shape as required.

So, we have: 15 * (average age before replacement + 2) - 15 * (average age before replacement) = (37 + 37) - (x + 23) Simplifying the left side of the equation: 15 * average age before replacement + 30 - 15 * average age before replacement = 74 - x - 23 The terms 15 * average age before replacement cancel out, and we are left with: 30 = 74 - x - 23 Now, let's solve for x: 30 = 51 - x Adding x to both sides: 30 + x = 51 Subtracting 30 from both sides: x = 51 - 30 x = 21 Therefore, the age of the first man who was replaced is boxed{21} years."},{"prompt":"Smith traveled 80 miles on his first trip at a certain speed.

When m=2, we substitute m into the equation to obtain: [ frac{{x}^{2}}{4-2}+frac{{y}^{2}}{2+2}=1 implies frac{{x}^{2}}{2}+frac{{y}^{2}}{4}=1 ] This is the equation of an ellipse. For an ellipse of the form frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 where b^2 > a^2, the foci are at (0, pm sqrt{b^2-a^2}).

First, let's convert all lengths to centimeters for consistency: - The first object is 100 cm. - The second object is 7 m 80 cm, which is 700 cm + 80 cm = 780 cm. Now, we find the GCD of 100 cm and 780 cm. The prime factors of 100 are 2^2 * 5^2. The prime factors of 780 are 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 13. The common factors are 2^2 * 5, which is 4 * 5 = 20 cm.

However, since we are given that the longest tape that can be used is 5 cm, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question. The 5 cm tape can measure the lengths of some objects exactly if their lengths are multiples of 5 cm.

Since either die can show 6, the number of outcomes: [ 5 times 2 = 10 text{ outcomes (since the 6 on die 1 and any other on die 2 plus vice versa)}. ] (C) **The sum of the dice is 6**: - We need to list all pairs where the sum equals 6: - (1, 5) - (2, 4) - (3, 3) - (4, 2) - (5, 1) - This gives us: [ 5 text{ outcomes}. ] 3. **Total Favorable Outcomes**: - Adding all the favorable outcomes together: [ 1 text{ (both 6)} + 10 text{ (one 6 and another die number)} + 5 text{ (sums to 6)} = 16 text{ favorable outcomes}. ] 4. **Calculating the Probability**: - The probability ( p ) of a favorable outcome is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes: [ p = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of outcomes}} = frac{16}{36}. ] - Simplifying this fraction: [ p = frac{4}{9}. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{4}{9}} ]"},{"prompt":"a circle with a radius of 15 units, a chord AB is the perpendicular bisector of another radius OC of the circle.

Similarly, the minimum value follows similar logic. 3. **Monotonic Sequences**: The largest sequence among (a_n), (b_n), (c_n) is non-increasing and bounded below (since all terms are positive). Hence, it converges. Let (h = b_n - a_n) and (k = c_n - b_n). Then we have: [ a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} = (a_n - b_n)(a_n + b_n - 2c_n), ] so: [ |a_{n+1} - b_{n+1}| = |h(h + 2k)| leq (h + k)^2 ] Similarly, [ begin{aligned} |b_{n+1} - c_{n+1}| &= |b_n - c_n||b_n + c_n - 2a_n| = k(2h + k) leq (h + k)^2, |c_{n+1} - a_{n+1}| &= |c_n - a_n||c_n + a_n - 2b_n| = |(h+k)(k-h)| leq (h+k)^2. end{aligned} ] 4. **Conclusion**: The difference between the largest and smallest values of (a_n, b_n, c_n) is getting progressively smaller and tends to zero. Therefore, all sequences converge to the same limit. Given their sum is consistently 1, this common limit must be (frac{1}{3}).

Given (t_1 cdot t_2 = 150), and knowing (t_1 = 6cos alpha + 8 sin alpha): [ t_2 = frac{150}{t_1} ] So: [ t_2 = frac{150}{6 cos alpha + 8 sin alpha} ] 4. The parametric coordinates of (N) are (x = t_2 cos alpha) and (y = t_2 sin alpha). Substitute (t_2) into these equations: [ x = frac{150 cos alpha}{6 cos alpha + 8 sin alpha} ] [ y = frac{150 sin alpha}{6 cos alpha + 8 sin alpha} ] 5. To eliminate the parameter (alpha), consider the equations: [ x (6 cos alpha + 8 sin alpha) = 150 cos alpha ] [ y (6 cos alpha + 8 sin alpha) = 150 sin alpha ] We get: [ 6x cos alpha + 8x sin alpha = 150 cos alpha ] [ 6 y cos alpha + 8 y sin alpha = 150 sin alpha ] Divide the first equation by (cosalpha) and the second by (sinalpha): [ cos alpha = frac{6x}{150 - 8x sin alpha} ] [ sin alpha = frac{8 y}{150 - 6 y cos alpha} ] To find the relation between (x) and (y), multiply the equations: [ 3 x + 4 y = 75 ] Thus, the equation of the locus of point (N) is: [ 3 x + 4 y = 75 ] [ boxed{3 x + 4 y = 75} ]"},{"prompt":"The circles ( S_{1}, ldots, S_{n} ) pass through point ( O ).

A rotational homothety is a combination of a rotation by a certain angle around point O and a dilation with center O. 2. **Mapping Points via Transformations:** By the problem's definition, the juncture of each jump at point X_i on circle S_i to X_{i+1} on S_{i+1} passes through the intersection of the circles S_i and S_{i+1} that is not point O. Therefore, we have: [ X_{i+1} = P_i(X_i) ] In other words, each X_{i+1} is the image of X_i under the transformation P_i. 3. **Composite Transformation:** We need to prove that after n jumps, starting from a point X_1 on circle S_1 and jumping all the way to X_{n+1}, which is on S_1 again, the point X_{n+1} is the same as X_1. This can be expressed as: [ X_{n+1} = (P_n circ P_{n-1} circ cdots circ P_1)(X_1) ] where circ denotes the composition of transformations. 4. **Identity Transformation:** We need to show that the composition of all transformations P_i forms an identity transformation over S_1. Since each P_i is a rotational homothety (a combination of rotation and dilation about O), the composite transformation (P_n circ P_{n-1} circ cdots circ P_1) is a rotational homothety with center O. 5. **Transformation Properties:** Specifically, since (P_n circ P_{n-1} circ cdots circ P_1) maps S_1 back to itself, and in the context of rotational homotheties, the only transformation that does this while keeping S_1 invariant is the identity transformation because a non-trivial rotational homothety that maps a circle to itself changes the positions on the circumference. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can conclude that the composite transformation is indeed the identity transformation: [ (P_n circ P_{n-1} circ cdots circ P_1)(X_1) = X_1 ] This implies after n jumps, the point X_1 returns to its original position. Hence, we have proven that after n jumps, the hopping point X returns to its starting point.

To complete this proof, we'll outline the key steps involved and provide some numerical examples. 1. **Identify Valid Numbers:** First, identify numbers with all digits being 6 or higher. Examples of such numbers include: - 6, 7, 8, 9 (one-digit) - 66, 67, 68, 69, 76, 77, 78, 79, 86, 87, 88, 89, 96, 97, 98, 99 (two-digit) - Similarly, identify numbers where each digit is at least 6 for three-digit, four-digit numbers, and so on. 2. **Find Pairs with Valid Product:** We need to ensure that the product of the number pairs also has all digits as at least 6.

We have g(x) = varphi(x) - 1, so g(x) < 0 if and only if varphi(x) < 1. Note that g(x) is a quadratic function in cos x, with leading coefficient 1. The discriminant of g(x) is (m-2)^2. If (m-2)^2 < 0, then g(x) has no real roots, and since its leading coefficient is positive, it follows that g(x) > 0 for all x in [0,frac{pi}{2}], which contradicts the requirement that g(x) < 0 for all x in [0,frac{pi}{2}]. Thus, we must have (m-2)^2 geq 0, which implies that m leq 2 or m geq 2. If m leq 2, then the minimum value of g(x) occurs at cos x = -frac{m}{2}, and we have g(-frac{m}{2}) = 1 - frac{m^2}{4} - 2m < 0. This implies that m^2 + 8m - 4 > 0. Solving for m, we get m < -4 - 2sqrt{5} or m > -4 + 2sqrt{5}. Since m leq 2, it follows that m < -4 - 2sqrt{5}.

For example, consider the following (4 times 4) grid: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline c_1 & c_1 & c_2 & c_2 hline c_1 & c_1 & c_2 & c_2 hline c_3 & c_3 & c_4 & c_4 hline c_3 & c_3 & c_4 & c_4 hline end{array} ] Each (2 times 2) block is colored with a single color, and each square in the block has exactly two neighbors of the same color. 3. **Proof that Only Even (m) and (n) Work:** We need to show that if such a coloring exists, then both (m) and (n) must be even. - **Closed Region Definition:** Define a *closed region* to be the set of all squares with color (c_i) for some (i) and the set of all squares that are enclosed by them. - **Claim 1: The only closed region that encloses no squares is the (2 times 2) square.** - **Proof:** Suppose there exists another such region. Let (C_1) be any convex corner of the region and (C_2) and (C_3) the squares that border (C_1). Then for (C_4) the square such that (C_1C_2C_3C_4) is a (2 times 2) square, (C_4) is located within the interior of the closed region. It follows that (C_2) and (C_3) may not border any more squares, from where connectivity implies the region is precisely a (2 times 2) square. (blacksquare) - **Claim 2: Every closed region has even dimensions.** - **Proof:** For simplicity, we will call these closed regions *even regions*. Notice that if a region is a union of two even regions, then it must itself be an even region. Now we proceed by induction on the number of squares in the closed region. For the base case, the smallest possible closed region is a (2 times 2) square, which is indeed an even region. For the inductive step, take any closed region and remove all the squares colored (c_i). These squares form a \\"band\\" around the periphery of the region, so the parity of the width or length measured at any given index will remain the same. The region that remains is a union of some (at least one) closed regions. By the inductive hypothesis, each of these closed regions is even, so their union is even, and the original closed region is also even, as required. (blacksquare) 4. **Conclusion:** Since our original (m times n) grid is a union of closed regions, it must have even dimensions too. Therefore, both (m) and (n) must be even. The final answer is ( boxed{ (m, n) } ) such that both (m) and (n) are even."},{"prompt":"Melissa wants to make some dresses to sell at the upcoming festival.

Let's break this problem down into structured steps. 1. **Understanding the problem requirements**: - Five guys each have a positive integer. - The GCD of any two numbers is greater than 1. - The GCD of all five numbers is 1. 2. **Clarify the conditions using prime factors**: - Each number must have at least two distinct prime divisors because if any number had fewer than 2 distinct prime divisors (i.e., only 1 prime factor), that prime would be a common divisor of all numbers, contrary to the given condition that the GCD of all numbers is 1. 3. **Utilizing prime factor counting ((omega(n)))**: - Let (omega(n)) be the number of distinct prime divisors of a number (n). - For each individual's number to have multiple prime divisors and avoid having a common prime divisor among all five numbers, each number must have at least (omega(n) geq 2). 4. **Calculate the required sum of exponents**: - If we consider a prime factorization of the product of these numbers as (p_{1}^{e_{1}} p_{2}^{e_{2}} cdots p_{k}^{e_{k}}), - We need (e_{1} + e_{2} + cdots + e_{k} geq 10) because we need at least two distinct primes for each of the five numbers. 5. **Minimize the product under conditions**: - Assume primes will factor into the numbers in a way that the product is minimized. - Importantly, no single prime (p) should appear more than once in its highest power to avoid lowering the product inefficiently. 6. **Choose minimal primes and allocate appropriately**: - For minimal values, consider using the smallest prime numbers, (2, 3,) and (5). - Given the constraints each number must be formed in such a way every combination gcd remains greater than (1) while overall gcd remains (1) and all primes appear in minimal multiplicities. 7. **Estimate a product to be minimized**: - If (e_{1}, e_{2} cdots e_{k} geq 10) we try to ensure the sum of prime multiplicities while keeping the count to essentials such as (2,3). - Simplest assumption: - Use (p_{1}=2) and (p_{2}=3) creating our key allocations: ([2^2, 2^3, 3^2, 3^3], 5^2, c). 8. **Example with minimal coverage**: - The smallest primes used distributed logically as (2^4, 3^4) and (5^2).

(2) From (1), we know that f(n)=a^{n}, Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for frac{f(n)-1}{f(n)+1}geqslant frac{n}{n+1} to hold is a^{n}geqslant 2n+1.

When 0 < x < frac{2}{3}, g'(x) < 0; When frac{2}{3} < x < 1, g'(x) > 0. So, the minimum value of g(x) in the interval (0,1) is g_{(x)_{min }}=g(frac{2}{3})=frac{1}{9} > 0.

Let's denote the points where the first sphere with center (O_1) touches the planes (text{SAB}) and (text{SAC}) as (B) and (C) respectively, and where the second sphere with center (O_2) touches the planes (text{SAC}) and (text{SBC}) as (A) and (B) respectively. 2. Consider a section of the pyramid (text{SABC}) by the plane passing through (B), (C), and (O_1). Let this plane intersect the edge (AS) of the pyramid at point (P). 3. Since lines (O_1B) and (O_1C) are perpendicular to the respective planes (text{SAB}) and (text{SAC}), and radii to the points of tangency, line (AS) is perpendicular to the plane of the section (plane (BCO_1)). Hence, (BP perp AS) and (CP perp AS), making (BPC) a linear angle of the dihedral angle between the planes of the lateral faces (text{SAB}) and (text{SAC}). 4. Let (angle BPC = 2alpha) and (O_1B = O_1C = R). Therefore, (angle O_1PB = angle O_1PC = alpha). 5. Let (M) be the midpoint of (BC), the base of the sections. Note that: [ O_1B = frac{BM}{cos alpha} ] Given (BM = frac{a}{2}): [ R = O_1B = frac{a}{2 cos alpha} ] 6. Similarly, determine the radius (R) for the second sphere centered at (O_2 ): [ R = frac{a}{2 cos alpha} ] 7. Let's use the cross-sections of the pyramid through (A), (M), and (S). Denote points (K) as the centroid of the regular triangular base (ABC): [ AS = b, quad AM = frac{a sqrt{3}}{2}, quad AK = frac{a sqrt{3}}{3} ] 8. Calculate (SK): [ SK = sqrt{AS^2 - AK^2} = sqrt{b^2 - left( frac{a sqrt{3}}{3} right)^2} = sqrt{b^2 - frac{a^2}{3}} ] 9. Find (PM): [ PM = frac{AM cdot SK}{AS} = frac{frac{a sqrt{3}}{2} cdot sqrt{3b^2 - a^2}}{b} = frac{a sqrt{3 b^2 - a^2}}{2b} ] 10. From the right triangle (BMP), use trigonometric relationships to find volumes and other necessary segments. 11. Since (SB perp O_1B) and (SB perp O_2B), the edge (SB) is the height of the pyramid (SO_1BO_2) with base (triangle O_1BO_2): [ S_{triangle O_1BO_2} = frac{1}{2} R^2 sin(180^circ - 2alpha) = frac{1}{2} R^2 sin 2alpha ] Given (R = frac{a}{2cosalpha}): [ V_{SO_1BO_2} = frac{1}{3} cdot S_{triangle O_1BO_2} cdot SB = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2}R^2 sin 2alpha cdot b ] 12.

Let's denote it by ( t_0 ). 5. **Contradiction with Upward Branches Assumption** - The quadratic polynomial takes its minimum value at the vertex, hence: [ f(0) > f(t_0) ] This is a contradiction since it was previously implied that ( f(t) geq f(0) ) for all positive ( t ). 6. **Second Assumption Analysis** - Continuing from our previous contradiction, consider cases where the roots are non-negative again, and the branches are still directed upward, leading to another contradiction. 7. **Case Analysis ( b = -a )** - Substitute ( b = -a ): [ f(2a^2) = f(a^2 + (-a)^2) geq f(2a(-a)) = f(-2a^2) ] - Therefore, [ 4ka^4 + 2ell a^2 + m geq 4ka^4 - 2ell a^2 + m ] - Simplifying, we get: [ 4ell a^2 geq 0 ] - Implying ( ell geq 0 ). 8. **Positive Leading Coefficient Analysis** - If ( k > 0 ) (upward branches), then the sum of the roots is ( -ell/k leq 0 ). Thus, at least one root must be negative. 9. **Negative Leading Coefficient Analysis** - If ( k < 0 ) (downward branches), substituting ( b = 0 ) leads to another contradiction: [ ka^4 + ell a^2 + m geq m ] Hence, [ a^2(ka^2 + ell) geq 0 ] which is impossible for ( a > sqrt{-ell/k} ), since ( k < 0 ) implies the expression would result in a negative quadratic dominance. 10. **Root Analysis for General Case** - For any ( 0 leq p leq q ), one can always find non-negative ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( p = 2ab ) and ( q = a^2 + b^2 ). Thus for any positive ( t ): [ f(p) leq f(q) ] # Conclusion: The above analysis thus leads to the conclusion that ( f(x) ) must have at least one negative root. This contradiction confirms that our initial assumption that both roots could be non-negative was incorrect. The quadratic polynomial ( f(x) ) indeed must have at least one negative root.

We can systematically fill in the table by starting from the topmost row and leftmost column, ensuring each 2 times 2 square is reducible. 3. **Claim**: Given any combination of rows and columns to switch, there is exactly one equivalent combination that does not flip the leftmost column. - **Proof**: If the given combination flips the leftmost column, then flip every column and row in the grid. This does not change any elements, as they are all flipped twice, but now the combination of rows and columns does not include the leftmost column. By examining the leftmost column, we can deduce which rows must have been included in the combination; then, by looking at the top row, we can deduce which columns must have been included. Thus, each combination is determined exactly. 4. **Conclusion**: The number of tables containing no irreducible 2 times 2 subtables is the same as the number of ways to put elements in the topmost row and leftmost column, which is 2^{n+m-1}. The number of unique ways to choose a combination of rows and columns to flip is also 2^{n+m-1}. Therefore, there is a bijection between legal combinations and tables containing only reducible 2 times 2 subtables, so every such table is clearable. blacksquare # Part (b) 1. **Observation**: A 4 times 4 subtable is reducible if and only if there are an even number of elements contained in the X-marked squares: [ begin{array}{cccc} O & X & X & O X & O & O & X X & O & O & X O & X & X & O end{array} ] 2. **Claim**: Given any 7 elements in a ring like the ring of X-marked squares above, we can uniquely choose the 8th element to ensure the 4 times 4 subtable is reducible. - **Proof**: The parity of the number of \\"-\\" signs in the X-marked positions determines the reducibility of the 4 times 4 subtable. Given any 7 elements, the 8th element is uniquely determined to ensure the parity is even. 3. **Counting Reducible Tables**: The total number of tables containing only reducible 4 times 4 subtables can be counted using the argument that the parities of the 8-element sets are linearly independent. Thus, we lose exactly one factor of 2 for each one. 4. **Conclusion**: Since there are (m-3)(n-3) such 4 times 4 subtables, there are 2^{3m+3n-9} tables containing only reducible subtables. The rank of the matrix formed by the rows, columns, and diagonals is 3m + 3n - 9, so the corank is 7. This ensures that any combination of flipping rows, columns, and diagonals can be achieved uniquely. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f an isosceles triangle has an interior angle of 110^{circ}, then the base angle of this isosceles triangle is ( ) A: 70^{circ} B: 45^{circ} C: 35^{circ} D: 50^{circ}","completion":"In an isosceles triangle, the sum of the interior angles equals 180^{circ}.

Show that the number of counterclockwise arcs of the form R_i to B_i that contain the point (1,0) is independent of the way we chose the ordering R_1, dots, R_n of the red points.","completion":"To solve this problem, we will use a combinatorial argument involving the concept of parity (odd or even nature) of the number of times the point (1,0) is enclosed by the arcs from R_i to B_i. 1. **Understanding the Setup**: - We have 2n points on the unit circle, with n points colored red and n points colored blue. - We are to label the blue points B_1, B_2, dots, B_n such that each B_i is the nearest blue point to R_i traveling counterclockwise. 2. **Defining the Arcs**: - For each red point R_i, the arc from R_i to B_i is defined as the segment of the circle starting at R_i and ending at B_i, moving counterclockwise. 3. **Counting Enclosures of (1,0)**: - We need to determine how many of these arcs contain the point (1,0). 4. **Parity Argument**: - Consider the total number of times the point (1,0) is passed as we trace out all arcs from R_i to B_i. Each time we pass (1,0), we either start an arc or end an arc. - Since each arc must pass (1,0) an even number of times (either 0, 2, 4, etc.), the total number of passes at (1,0) by all arcs combined is even. 5. **Invariance Under Reordering**: - Suppose we change the order of the red points. This reordering might change the specific pairings of R_i to B_i, but it does not change the total number of blue points or the structure of the circle. - The key observation is that each blue point is still paired exactly once with a red point, and each arc still spans a segment of the circle. The total number of times (1,0) is passed (counted across all arcs) remains even. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since the total number of times (1,0) is passed is even, and since changing the order of red points does not affect this total, the number of arcs containing (1,0) (which contributes to this total) must also remain invariant under any reordering of the red points. Thus, the number of counterclockwise arcs of the form R_i to B_i that contain the point (1,0) is independent of the way we chose the ordering R_1, dots, R_n of the red points. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Prove that for any two types of dominoes, there exists a rectangle that can be tiled by dominoes of either type.","completion":"1. **Define the problem and terms:** We need to prove that for any two types of dominoes, there exists a rectangle that can be tiled by dominoes of either type. Suppose we have two types of dominoes: the first type is (a, b) and the second type is (a', b'), where a, b, a', b' are integers. 2. **Reference a tiling rule for dominoes:** A domino of type (a, b) can tile a rectangle of size max{1, 2a} times 2b because the maximum length possible is either 1 (if a is small) or twice a and the width is twice b (since a single domino spans 2 units in width when laid flat). Similarly, a domino of type (a', b') can tile a rectangle of size max{1, 2a'} times 2b'. 3. **Identify a common rectangle size:** We need to find a common rectangle that can be tiled by both types of dominoes simultaneously. Consider a rectangle that has both dimensions large enough to encompass the tiling rules for both domino types: [ (max{ max{1, 2a}, max{1, 2a'} }) times ( 2b cdot 2b' ) ] This simplifies to: [ max{1, 2a, 2a'} times 4bb' ] 4. **Conclusion of the proof:** Therefore, a rectangle of size max{1, 2a, 2a'} times 4bb' can be tiled by either of the two types of dominoes (a, b) or (a', b'). This ensures that there exists a common rectangle that can be tiled by either type of domino. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Let f(x) = x^4 4x^2 + 4 and g(x) = 3x^2 + x + 2.

If the tax is diminished by 25%, the new tax rate is T - (25/100) * T = 0.75 * T. If the consumption increased by 20%, the new consumption is C + (20/100) * C = 1.20 * C. The new revenue generated from the tax is (0.75 * T) * (1.20 * C). To find the effect on the revenue, we compare the new revenue to the original revenue: New Revenue / Original Revenue = (0.75 * T * 1.20 * C) / (T * C) Simplifying, we get: New Revenue / Original Revenue = (0.75 * 1.20) * (T * C) / (T * C) New Revenue / Original Revenue = 0.75 * 1.20 New Revenue / Original Revenue = 0.90 This means the new revenue is 90% of the original revenue, which is a decrease of 10%.

Thus, if the inequality frac{4}{n^2} + frac{1}{n} + t cdot a_n geq 0 is always satisfied, we need t to be: t geq -9. The range of values for the real number t is then [-9, +infty). boxed{[-9, +infty)} By using the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence, we can derive a_n.

If the chromatic number of every finite subgraph of ( G ) is at most ( k ), then the chromatic number of ( G ) is also at most ( k ).","completion":"We need to prove the theorem 8.1.3 (de Bruijn & Erdős, 1951) which states that for a graph (G = (V, E)) and (k in mathbb{N}), if every finite subgraph of (G) can be colored with at most (k) colors, then (G) itself can also be colored with at most (k) colors. First Proof (Finite Graph Argument) 1. Let (v_0, v_1, ldots) be an enumeration of the vertex set (V). 2. Define (G_n := G[{v_0, ldots, v_n}]), the induced subgraph of (G) on the first (n+1) vertices. 3. Let (V_n) be the set of all possible (k)-colorings of (G_n). 4. We consider the set (cup_{n in mathbb{N}} V_n) and define a new graph whose edge set consists of all pairs (cc'), where (c in V_n) and (c' in V_{n-1}) such that (c) restricted to ({v_0, ldots, v_{n-1}}) equals (c'). 5. Construct an infinite path (c_0, c_1, ldots) in this new graph such that (c_n in V_n) for every (n). 6. The union (c := cup_{n in mathbb{N}} c_n) forms a (k)-coloring of (G). By this argument, since any finite subgraph (G_n) can be (k)-colored, we can construct an infinite sequence of colorings, thereby (G) itself can be colored with (k) colors. Second Proof (Compactness Principle) 1. Let (X := V) and (S := {1, ldots, k}), and (mathcal{F}) be the collection of all finite subsets of (V). 2. For each (Y in mathcal{F}), let (mathcal{A}(Y)) be the set of all (k)-colorings of the induced subgraph (G[Y]). 3. To prove the theorem, we need to find a function from (V) to ({1, ldots, k}) that yields a (k)-coloring for (G). 4. By the compactness principle, we only need to show that for any finite subset (mathcal{Y} subseteq mathcal{F}), there exists a function from (V) to ({1, ldots, k}) which restricts to a (k)-coloring on every (G[Y]) for (Y in (mathcal{Y}). 5. This is evident by taking a (k)-coloring of the finite graph (G[cup mathcal{Y}]) and extending it arbitrarily to the rest of (V). Third Proof (Tychonoff's Theorem) 1. Consider the product space (X := prod_{V} {1, ldots, k} = {1, ldots, k}^{V}), which is the set of all functions from (V) to ({1, ldots, k}). 2. This forms a compact space using the product topology by Tychonoff's Theorem. 3. The basic open sets in this topology have the form O_h := {f in X mid f|_U = h}, where (h) is a function from a finite subset (U subseteq V) to ({1, ldots, k}). 4. Since every finite subgraph (G[Y]) can be (k)-colored, it implies there is a non-empty intersection of compact sets corresponding to the (k)-colorings over all finite subsets. 5. By compactness, the intersection over all finite sets is non-empty, hence there exists a global (k)-coloring for (G). Thus, the theorem holds that if every finite subgraph of (G) can be colored with at most (k) colors, then the entire graph (G) can also be colored with (k) colors.

Subtract (b) from both sides of the equation: [ a - b + b sin gamma = a sin gamma ] Rearrange to obtain: [ (a - b)(1 - sin gamma) = 0 ] 4. Since (a neq b), we must have: [ 1 - sin gamma = 0 implies sin gamma = 1 implies gamma = 90^circ ] 5. Using similar arguments for (a neq c) and (b neq c), we would obtain: [ sin beta = 1 implies beta = 90^circ ] and [ sin alpha = 1 implies alpha = 90^circ ] 6.

We define a \\"good\\" sequence of 5 beads as one that contains exactly 3 green beads, 1 red bead, and 1 blue bead. We need to find the maximum number of such \\"good\\" sequences that could exist on this string. 1. **Counting Bead Involvement:** - Notice that the first and last green beads can be part of at most 3 \\"good\\" sequences, because a green bead at the end can be included in a sequence beginning 0, 1, or 2 positions before it. - The second and penultimate green beads can be part of at most 4 \\"good\\" sequences following similar reasoning for positions. - All remaining 71 green beads can be part of at most 5 sequences each. 2. **Formulating the Inequality:** [ 2 cdot 3 + 2 cdot 4 + 71 cdot 5 ] The first term (2 cdot 3) represents the fact that the first and last green beads can each be part of at most 3 sequences. The second term (2 cdot 4) represents the fact that the second and penultimate green beads can each be part of up to 4 sequences. The last term (71 cdot 5) corresponds to the 71 middle beads each being part of 5 sequences. 3. **Calculations:** - First and last green beads: [ 2 cdot 3 = 6 ] - Second and penultimate green beads: [ 2 cdot 4 = 8 ] - Remaining 71 green beads: [ 71 cdot 5 = 355 ] Adding these together gives: [ 6 + 8 + 355 = 369 ] 4. **Sequence Counting:** - Each \\"good\\" sequence includes 3 green beads, and since each green bead is counted as part of multiple sequences three times, we divide the sum by 3 to find the number of unique sequences: [ frac{369}{3} = 123 ] Therefore, the maximal number of \\"good\\" sequences is 123.

Alex avait toujours été fasciné par le monde des Pokémon, mais il n'avait jamais eu l'occasion de voyager ou de rencontrer des Pokémon en dehors du village. Un soir, alors qu'Alex se promenait dans les bois à la recherche de baies pour son dernier projet scolaire, il est tombé sur une étrange lueur. Il s'est approché pour voir ce que c'était et a soudainement été englouti par une lumière aveuglante. Quand il a rouvert les yeux, il se trouvait dans un monde étrange et merveilleux qu'il n'avait jamais vu auparavant. Devant lui se trouvait une grande ville, pleine de couleurs vives et de bâtiments étonnants. Des Pokémon de différentes formes et tailles se promenaient dans les rues, jouant ou travaillant avec leurs dresseurs. Alex a été pris de court par ce qu'il voyait, mais aussi excité de découvrir ce nouveau monde et toutes les aventures qu'il y avait à y vivre. Alex est sorti de la forêt et a commencé à explorer la ville avec curiosité. Il a vu des gens se battre dans des arènes avec des Pokémon, d'autres qui se promenaient avec leurs amis Pokémon. Il a même vu des scientifiques étudier les Pokémon dans des laboratoires. Soudain, Alex se souvint qu'il était loin de chez lui et qu'il ne savait pas comment il allait rentrer. Il a commencé à chercher un moyen de contacter ses amis et sa famille chez lui. Après avoir visité une boutique, il a réussi à trouver un ordinateur portable et a tenté de se connecter à Internet. Cependant, il a été surpris de constater que le réseau était très différent de celui qu'il connaissait chez lui. Les seules pages Web existantes étaient liées aux Pokémon. Pendant ce temps, Alex a également commencé à réaliser qu'il avait été emmené dans le monde des Pokémon en devenant un dresseur. Il a réalisé qu'il devait apprendre à capturer, entraîner et faire combattre des Pokémon s'il voulait survivre dans ce monde et peut-être trouver un moyen de rentrer chez lui.

Il n'était pas habitué à l'effort physique de marcher aussi longtemps et il se sentait épuisé. C'est alors qu'il a entendu un bruit dans les buissons proches. Prudemment, il s'est approché et a vu un petit Pokémon très coloré sortir des buissons et s'approcher de lui. C'était un Munna, un petit Pokémon endormi qui se nourrit des rêves des gens. Alex s'est empressé de sortir sa Pokéball, il espérait attraper le Pokémon et commencer sa collection de monstres. Cependant, le Munna était rapide et il a commencé à esquiver les tentatives de capture. Alex n'avait jamais attrapé un Pokémon auparavant et il a commencé à paniquer. Il ne voulait pas manquer cette occasion de capturer son premier Pokémon, alors il a commencé à réfléchir à une stratégie. Il a commencé à regarder attentivement le Munna et a remarqué qu'il semblait dormir la plupart du temps. Alex a réalisé que s'il pouvait endormir le Pokémon, il pourrait peut-être augmenter ses chances de le capturer. Il a fouillé dans son sac à dos et a trouvé un paquet de baies. Après quelques instants, il a identifié une baie qui pouvait être utilisée pour endormir un Pokémon. Il a jeté la baie en direction du Munna. Le petit Pokémon a commencé à manger la baie et s'est endormi en quelques instants. Alex a saisi sa chance et a lancé sa Pokéball vers le Munna endormi. La capture a réussi, la Pokéball a clignoté en rouge et le Munna a été capturé. Alex était ravi, il avait capturé son premier Pokémon et avait commencé sa collection. Il a rapidement renommé le Munna et l'a appelé Luna.

Однако жители его мира опасаются его сил и недоброжелатели окружают его всюду. Также на мага навалились семейные разногласия, серьезные проблемы с друзьями, и десять лет после юности осталось так мало. Это заставило Энди начать сбегать из своей реальности, используя свою способность путешествовать по альтернативным мирам. Акт второй: Альтернативные миры. В одном из альтернативных миров Энди обнаружил, что маги считаются членами высшей касты, и их уважают и почитают. В другом мире маги использовали свои силы в научных исследованиях, прокладывая путь перед знанием. Но что бы ни происходило в этих мирах, Энди продолжал ощущать глубокую пустоту, преследующую его. Эти визиты мало что изменили в его восприятии реальности. Акт третий: Камень энергии.

Однако камень также делал перемещение неконтролируемым, и Энди рискнул навсегда потеряться в пространстве и времени. Акт четвертый: Преодоление трудностей. Вскоре этот камень стал проклятьем для Энди. Он может перемещаться туда, где растут кислотные грибы, в мир разбушевавшейся Пустыни, и даже в жерло вулкана. Энди стал еще больше страдать от этой бесконтрольной силы, но вскоре понял, что противостоять этому камню – значит противостоять самому себе и его страхам. Время шло, Энди посетил десятки миров, и каждый раз получать новые перспективы и мысли. Он наблюдал, как различные миры справляются с проблемами и преодолевают неприятности. В конце концов, Энди пришел к пониманию, что эта неконтролируемая энергия – это не беда, а путь к невиданным возможностям. Энди смог сжить эту непокорную энергию, чтобы овладеть своими перемещениями, и шагнул на новый этап своей жизни. Акт пятый: Урок для Энди. Пройдя через все трудности и испытания, Энди понял, что борьба с реальностью – это перестать бояться сталкиваться с ней. Он осознал, что проблемы и неприятности – это лишь опыt, который надо самому прожить и оценить. Теперь уже без помощи волшебного камня, Энди понял, что улучшить свой мир – значит сделать первый шаг навстречу ему. Так Энди вернулся в свой родной мир, готов противостоять его трудностям, смело идти к своей судьбе. Эти перемещения раз и навсегда изменили его отношение к реальности. В конце концов, Энди понял, что принять и изменить что-то в себе – это значит изменить весь мир на лучше."},{"prompt":"Сделай раскадровку для фильма, из пяти кадров, по одному для каждого акта","completion":"Кадр 1: (Акт первый - Энди и его проблемы) У Энди, закрытые великими воротами, в его доме стены украшены трофеями с бесчисленных путешествий.

A coprire un muro dela stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. Inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore…","completion":"Il racconto narra la storia di Debbie e Andrey, una coppia stabile e discreta, ma con una differenza importante: Andrey è asessuale e non vuole intimità fisica con la compagna. Debbie prova ad avvicinarsi al marito nella notte, ma viene respinta e deve accontentarsi di dormire tenendosi per mano. La delusione di Debbie è evidente e, non riuscendo a sopportare la mancanza di intimità, si allontana dal letto per raggiungere il soggiorno e utilizzare un vibratore. Il racconto evidenzia il conflitto interiore della protagonista, che ama il marito ma non riesce a tollerare la mancanza di intimità fisica. La storia offre spunti interessanti sulla difficoltà di gestire la differenza di desiderio sessuale in coppia e sulla complessità dei rapporti interpersonali."},{"prompt":"Nel racconto sono stati inseriti alcuni elementi per simboleggiare l’asessualità di Andrey: la carta da parati e la carta da gioco. Riconosci il loro significato?","completion":"Potrebbe essere una forma di interpretazione soggettiva, ma ci sono diverse teorie sull'interpretazione simbolica di questi elementi nel racconto. La carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere potrebbe rappresentare la mancanza di polarità sessuale di Andrey, in quanto il viola è un colore associato alla mescolanza dei colori primari rosso e blu, bianco e grigio sono colori neutri e nero rappresenta la totale assenza di luce. La carta da gioco potrebbe essere interpretata come un riferimento al fatto che Andrey gioca a carte scoperte riguardo alla sua asessualità, ma al tempo stesso rappresenta anche la sua carta migliore, l'asso di cuori, che però non è abbastanza per conquistare la compagna. Tuttavia, è importante sottolineare che l'autore potrebbe aver inserito questi elementi solo per arricchire la descrizione della stanza e del personaggio, e non necessariamente con un preciso significato simbolico."},{"prompt":"перефразируй.

Jiren, a warrior from Universe 11, was considered to be one of the strongest fighters in the multiverse. However, with Goku, Sonic, and Lilac teaming up, they were able to put up a good fight against him. The battle began with Jiren unleashing his full power, causing shockwaves that shook the entire arena. Goku, Sonic, and Lilac quickly realized that they needed to work together if they wanted to stand a chance against him. Sonic and Lilac took to the skies, using their speed and aerial abilities to avoid Jiren's attacks while Goku powered up with his Super Saiyan Blue form. Goku launched himself at Jiren, landing punch after punch, but Jiren was able to block each blow with ease. Meanwhile, Sonic and Lilac launched a barrage of attacks from the sky, but Jiren was still able to dodge and block most of them. However, the combined assault of Goku, Sonic, and Lilac began to wear down Jiren, and they were finally able to land a few solid hits on him. Jiren started to lose his composure, and his attacks became more erratic. Goku saw an opening and used his Kamehameha Wave to blast Jiren with a massive energy wave. Sonic and Lilac followed up with a Sonic Boom and Cyclone attack, sending Jiren crashing to the ground. As Jiren struggled to get back up, Goku, Sonic, and Lilac prepared to unleash their most powerful attack yet. Goku used his Dragon Fist, Sonic unleashed his Super Sonic form, and Lilac channeled all of her energy into her Cyclone attack. The three attacks combined into a massive energy beam that blasted Jiren out of the arena, taking him out of the fight. The crowd erupted in cheers as Goku, Sonic, and Lilac emerged victorious.

So, they decided to join forces and form a team that would work together to protect the multiverse. Over the next few weeks, Goku, Sonic, and Lilac traveled across the multiverse, seeking out new challenges and training opportunities while recruiting other powerful warriors to their cause. Together, they faced off against countless enemies, from nefarious villains to powerful cosmic entities. Along the way, they formed bonds of friendship and trust, pushing each other to new heights of power and skill. Their combined strength proved to be a formidable force, and they quickly became known as the protectors of the multiverse.

The battle began with Jiren unleashing a massive energy wave that shook the entire arena. Goku, Sonic, and Lilac quickly realized that they needed to work together perfectly if they wanted to win this fight. Sonic and Lilac took to the skies while Goku prepared himself to tap into the power of Ultra Instinct. Jiren tried to attack Goku with his massive fists, but Goku was able to dodge each of them with effortless ease thanks to Ultra Instinct. Sonic and Lilac followed up with a barrage of attacks while Goku went for Jiren's core. Jiren managed to block some of the attacks, but he was still being pushed back by their sheer power. Jiren saw that he needed to take things up a notch, so he powered up to his full strength and unleashed a massive fireball attack. But, with Goku's Ultra Instinct powers, he was able to deflect the attack back at Jiren. Sonic and Lilac followed up with their most powerful attacks, and the combined energy blast hit Jiren with overwhelming force. Jiren was left barely standing, but he still had the will to fight. He powered himself up to his absolute maximum level and charged straight at the trio. Goku met him with a punch to the face, while Sonic and Lilac tackled Jiren from both sides.

At first, Goku, Sonic, and Lilac would assume that their allies or enemies had locked them away for some reason. As time passed, they would realize how much time had passed and how difficult it would be to escape, let alone survive. Their isolation in the Time Chamber would take a severe psychological toll on them. They would be alone with their own thoughts and emotions for thousands of years. They may even start to question their own sanity and whether they will ever return to the outside world. During this period, Sonic and Lilac's relationship may develop past a friendship, as they rely on each other for support and companionship in such dire circumstances. Goku, who has lost so much time and experience, may feel regret and despair, knowing that he could have prevented this. For millennia, they would be training non-stop in the Time Chamber, building their strength and honing their skills. They may even master new techniques or unlock new levels of power, allowing them to surpass their prior limits. Eventually, they would find a way to escape their confinement, and when they do, they would be unrecognizable to those they once knew. They would have amassed so much power and become so skilled that they may have trouble re-integrating into society. Moreover, their experience in the Time Chamber may create trust issues, making it hard for them to form new relationships with others. They may also wonder why they were betrayed and locked up which could lead to resentment and anger. In conclusion, if Goku, Sonic, and Lilac were betrayed and locked in the Time Chamber for millennia, it would be a traumatic and life-changing experience. The effects would be severe and long-lasting, and they would emerge as completely different characters from who they were before their confinement."},{"prompt":"Dragon Ball and Freedom planet and sonic: What if goku, sonic and lilac Were Betrayed and Locked In The Time Chamber For Millenia (Goku, Sonic, and Lilac new transformation)","completion":"If Goku, Sonic, and Lilac were betrayed and locked in the Time Chamber for millennia, it would be an incredibly daunting and transformative experience for them. They would be subjected to immense isolation, without any external contact or support, with nothing but time and their thoughts.

This extreme training would lead to the development of new, never-before-seen transformations that would make them truly formidable fighters and warriors. As Goku, Sonic, and Lilac worked to escape their confinement, they would continue to train and evolve, unlocking untold levels of strength and power. They might even develop new combat abilities and techniques, moving beyond anything they had even envisioned prior. When they finally escaped the Time Chamber, they would be entirely different fighters, with powers and abilities beyond what anyone could have ever imagined. They would be nearly unstoppable, with their new transformations, skills, and powers making them even more formidable than before. Goku would master a new form of Ultra Instinct, where his body and mind become one in a way that almost defies explanation. Sonic would develop a new level of super speed, allowing him to outrun entire armies and armies of enemies. Lilac would tap into her inner power, developing a new form of hyper-crystal energy that could level entire cities. With these new transformations and powers, Goku, Sonic, and Lilac would become the protectors of the multiverse, feared and revered by all who knew them.

No entanto, Vettel decidiu desobedecer as instruções da equipe e ultrapassou Webber, vencendo a corrida em primeiro lugar. A ordem Multi-21 era um código usado pela Red Bull Racing para pedir que seus pilotos parassem de competir e mantivessem suas posições de corrida naquele momento específico. O pedido para que Vettel não ultrapassasse Webber foi um acordo prévio entre a equipe e seus pilotos antes da corrida. No entanto, Vettel decidiu ignorar a ordem da equipe e ultrapassou Webber, vencendo a corrida. Isso causou raiva e ressentimento de Webber e de muitos observadores, que acreditavam que o alemão havia violado a confiança da equipe e desrespeitado seu companheiro de equipe. O caso Multi-21 gerou muita controvérsia e discórdia entre os fãs da Fórmula 1 e outros indivíduos da indústria. Isso levou a um debate mais amplo sobre a ética de equipe e o papel das ordens de equipe na Fórmula 1. O caso também colocou em dúvida a capacidade da Red Bull Racing de manter seus pilotos sob controle e gerenciar sua equipe."},{"prompt":"Aquele caso foi a gota d'água para Mark Webber na F1, que não vinha tendo boas relações com Vettel, já que se envolveu numa colisão no GP da Turquia de 2010. O australiano não venceu nenhuma corrida em 2013 e se aposentou da categoria ao fim da temporada???","completion":"Isso mesmo. O caso Multi-21 foi um dos vários eventos que desgastaram a relação entre Webber e Vettel durante a temporada de 2013. Além disso, Webber já havia tido divergências com a equipe na temporada anterior, quando Vettel ignorou as instruções da equipe para não ultrapassar Webber no GP do Brasil de 2012. Após o incidente na Malásia, Webber não venceu outra corrida em 2013 e anunciou sua aposentadoria da Fórmula 1 ao final da temporada. Ele se juntou à equipe Porsche para correr no Campeonato Mundial de Endurance (WEC) e ganhou o título em 2015."},{"prompt":"Hoje em dia, anos depois, a relação entre Webber e Vettel parece ter esfriado, com os dois voltando a ser amigos, incluindo uma entrevista em 2017???","completion":"Sim, a relação entre Webber e Vettel parece ter melhorado ao longo dos anos e os dois agora parecem ser amigos novamente. Em uma entrevista em 2017, Webber disse que ele e Vettel tinham se encontrado em várias ocasiões na Austrália e na Europa, e tinham retomado sua amizade após o final de suas carreiras na Fórmula 1. Webber também disse que admira a realização de Vettel de conquistar quatro títulos mundiais, destacando que Vettel é um dos maiores pilotos da história da Fórmula 1. Esse tipo de reconciliação não é incomum na Fórmula 1, uma vez que muitos pilotos têm rivalidades e desentendimentos em suas carreiras, mas acabam se tornando amigos novamente depois de se aposentarem."},{"prompt":"Dragon Ball and Freedom planet and sonic: What if goku, sonic and lilac Were Betrayed and Locked In The Time Chamber For Millenia part 1 (sonic x lilac)","completion":"It was a peaceful day in Green Hill Zone when Sonic and Lilac were suddenly sucked into a temporal vortex.

As they continued their rigorous training, they found themselves growing stronger with each passing day. They felt a newfound sense of power and purpose, fueled by their desire to defeat their oppressors. The Time Chamber had become their home, and they had become masters of their craft. One day, after millennia of training, they felt a shift in the energy around them. The walls of the chamber began to shake, and a blinding light filled the space. When the light subsided, they found themselves outside the chamber's door, standing in front of the Time Guardian. \\"Your time in the chamber has ended,\\" the Time Guardian said. \\"You have done well, and your training has made you stronger than ever before.\\" Goku, Sonic, and Lilac felt a rush of excitement as they left the chamber, their bodies emitting a new aura of power. \\"We have to find a way to free our world from tyranny,\\" Sonic said, determined. \\"But we need to be careful,\\" Goku cautioned. \\"We may be powerful now, but we are still vulnerable.\\" They continued their journey, knowing that they had a long road ahead of them.

The village was home to a colorful cast of characters who were welcoming and kind. As they walked through the village, they heard a faint tune that grew louder with each passing moment. They followed the sound until they came upon a small blue hedgehog playing a melodica. \\"Hello there!\\" the hedgehog said, looking up at them. \\"My name is Milla.

The inflammation can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, an autoimmune disease, or exposure to certain toxins such as alcohol or drugs. Symptoms of myocarditis can include chest pain, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, and swelling in the legs or ankles. In severe cases, myocarditis can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Treatment for myocarditis may include medication to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation, rest, and in some cases, hospitalization to provide close monitoring and supportive care. In some cases, a heart transplant may be necessary if the heart becomes severely damaged. Prevention of myocarditis involves taking steps to prevent viral infections, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding exposure to toxins or substances that may damage the heart."},{"prompt":"Подсказка с городами работает в index.ejs, но не работает в модальном окне в profile.ejs: раньше я пробовал селектор #city вместо input name, но это не помогает.

В некоторых случаях метод инициализации автозаполнения не работает в скрытых элементах, таких как модальные окна. Чтобы исправить это, вы можете попробовать инициализировать плагин автозаполнения после открытия модального окна.

('#edit-profile-modal').on('shown.bs.modal', function () { initAutocomplete(); }); // ... function initAutocomplete() { (\\"input[name='city']\\").autocomplete({ source: '/autocomplete/cities', minLength: 1, }); } // ... <\/script> \`\`\` Этот код инициализирует автозаполнение каждый раз, когда модальное окно полностью открывается.

The program initializes different settings of the microcontroller such as GPIO, interrupts, SPI, and timer. The #include \\"STM32F10x.h\\" preprocessor directive includes a header file \\"STM32F10x.h\\" which contains the definitions of the peripherals and registers of the Microcontroller. The #define SampleNumber 100 directive defines symbolic constant SampleNumber and its value is 100. The program declares several functions such as GPIOInit(), gpioIntInit(), spi1Init(), DAC(), ADC(), etc. The main function initializes GPIO, interrupts, SPI and timers on the Microcontroller. It uses an infinite loop. The GPIOInit() function initializes the GPIO pins of the microcontroller. The gpioIntInit() function initializes an external interrupt to handle an input push button in port B pin 1. The EXTI1_IRQHandler() function handles the external interrupt. The timer2Init() function initializes a timer. The TIM2_IRQHandler() function handles the timer interrupt. The GenaralSramSetting(), spi1Init(), ADC(), DAC(), RamReader(), and RamWriter() functions are used to handle the transfer and reception of data on the SPI bus for communication with an SRAM memory chip. Different registers of the Microcontroller such as RCC, GPIOA, GPIOB, EXTI, TIM2, SPI1 are used in the program. Overall, this program is used for interfacing the STM32F103C6 microcontroller with an SRAM memory chip through SPI communication, using external interrupts and a timer for controlling data transfer and reception."},{"prompt":"can you explain every line seperately?","completion":"Certainly, I can explain each line separately.

Quando o piloto acionava o DRS convencionalmente, uma das aberturas era aberta, reduzindo o arrasto, o que aumentava a velocidade do carro em linha reta. Porém, com o DRS duplo, a segunda abertura era ativada quando o piloto também acionava o pedal do freio, criando um vórtice aerodinâmico que aumentava ainda mais a velocidade do carro. A equipe Mercedes usou essa inovação numa única corrida, o GP da Bélgica de 2012. Michael Schumacher foi o piloto escolhido para testar o DRS duplo, enquanto seu companheiro de equipe, Nico Rosberg, usou o DRS convencional. Durante os treinos livres, a Mercedes parecia ter uma vantagem significativa com o DRS duplo, mas outras equipes, incluindo a Red Bull e a McLaren, protestaram alegando que tal inovação era ilegal. Após um longo debate, a FIA acabou considerando o DRS duplo ilegal, e a Mercedes retirou-o do carro de Schumacher antes da corrida. Rosberg também não teve um bom desempenho durante a corrida, acabando em sétimo lugar. Assim, o DRS duplo utilizado pela Mercedes em 2012 foi considerado um delírio coletivo, uma vez que a equipe não obteve nenhuma vantagem significativa e acabou tendo que abandonar a ideia em consequência da controvérsia em torno de sua legalidade."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],E={key:0},N={key:1};function G(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(x,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
